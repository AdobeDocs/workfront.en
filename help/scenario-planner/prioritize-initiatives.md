# Update initiative priorities in the *Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner*

Prioritizing initiatives is important because initiatives receive job roles and budget resources from the plan in the order they are listed on the plan.

You can prioritize initiatives on a plan that you created or on a plan that someone shared with you.

For information about creating plans, see [Create and edit plans in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/create-and-edit-plans.md).

For information about creating initiatives, see [Create and edit initiatives in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/create-and-edit-initiatives.md).

## Update initiative priorities

When you change the priority of initiatives, you modify their listing order on the plan.

We recommend that you place more urgent initiatives at the top of a plan and the more fluid ones - that could be done any time and only if resources are available - at the bottom of the plan.

>[!NOTE]
>
>*Workfront* allocates plan resources to initiatives in the order they are listed on the plan.&nbsp;
>
>For example, if the plan has 3 available Engineers and Initiative 1 and Initiative 2 each require 2 Engineers to complete and they are both scheduled for the same time frame, *Workfront* associates 2 Engineers with Initiative 1 and one remaining available Engineer with Initiative 2. In this case Initiative 2 shows as having a conflict, because it is missing one Engineer. Sometimes, changing the priority of your initiatives is the only way to avoid conflicts on a plan.

To update initiative priority:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Click the <span class="bold">Main Menu</span> icon <img src="assets/main-menu-icon.png">, then click&nbsp;<em>Scenarios</em>.</p> <p>A list of plans displays.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2">Click the name of a plan to open it, then locate the initiatives you want to prioritize.</li> 
 <li value="3"> 
  <div> 
   <p>Click the box to the left of one or more of the initiatives' name and do one of the following:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li> <p>Click the handle to the left of one of the selected initiatives' names, then drag it up or down in the list to change the initiative's priority.</p> <p><em>Workfront</em> displays the number of selected initiatives.</p> <p> <img src="assets/multi-select-initiative-number.png"> </p> </li> 
    <li> <p>Click the <span class="bold">Prioritize</span> box at the bottom of the plan, then choose from the following options:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <p><span class="bold">Top</span>: Moves the selected initiatives to the top of the initiative list.&nbsp;The selected initiatives are listed first on the plan.</p> </li> 
      <li> <p><span class="bold">Bottom</span>:&nbsp;Moves the selected initiatives to the bottom of the initiative list.&nbsp;The selected initiatives are listed last on the plan.</p> </li> 
      <li> <p><span class="bold">Select a number</span>: Moves the selected initiatives after the initiative you indicate here. </p> <p> <img src="assets/prioritize-initiatives-expanded-highlighted-350x171.png" style="width: 350;height: 171;"> </p> </li> 
     </ul> <p><em>Workfront</em> immediately places the selected initiatives where you indicate and the numbers of all initiatives update accordingly. </p> </li> 
   </ul> 
  </div> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Save Plan</span> to save your changes. </p> </li> 
</ol>
