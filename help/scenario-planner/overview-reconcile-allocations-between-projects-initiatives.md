# Overview of reconciling resource allocations between projects and initiatives  {#overview-of-reconciling-resource-allocations-between-projects-and-initiatives}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>Your organization must purchase an additional license for the *`Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner`* so that you can view initiative information on a project. For information about obtaining the *`Workfront Scenario Planner`*, see [Access needed to use the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](access-needed-to-use-sp.md) . 


You can connect projects with initiatives to ensure your strategic plans and the actual work are in sync. As you outline your strategic plans and initiatives in the *`Scenario Planner`* and you plan the actual work in a project, you can ensure your resources on both the project and the initiatives match, so you won't either overallocate or underutilize them. 


## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you begin, you must have the following:



*  A plan in the *`Scenario Planner`* with an initiative connected to a project. 
*  Required job role allocations for the initiative. 
*  Tasks or issues on the project that have Planned Hours and are assigned to one of the following:

    
    
    *  Job roles
    *  Users associated with job roles
    
    





## Connect projects and initiatives {#connect-projects-and-initiatives}



>[!NOTE]
>
>You can create initiatives and connect them to projects only if your organization has purchased an additional license for the *`Workfront Scenario Planner`*. 


You can connect projects with initiatives by doing one of the following:



*  Import projects into a plan, as new initiatives


  For more information, see [Import projects to plans in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](import-projects-to-plans.md).

*  Publish initiatives to projects


  For more information, see `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> <a href="publish-scenarios-update-projects.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner</a> </MadCap:conditionalText>`. 



Both processes create a connection between the projects and their corresponding initiatives. After connecting them, you can manage their resource allocations by comparing them and ensuring that they match. 


## Considerations about reconciling resources on linked projects and initiatives {#considerations-about-reconciling-resources-on-linked-projects-and-initiatives}



>[!NOTE]
>
>You can view initiatives, connect them to projects, and view their resource allocations on a project only if your organization has purchased an additional license for the *`Workfront Scenario Planner`*. 





*   You can assign users, teams, and job roles to work items on a project and you can assign job roles to initiatives. As a result, you can only reconcile job roles between projects and initiatives. 


  >[!TIP] {type="tip"}
  >
  >To reconcile the users' time on a project with role allocations on the initiatives you must associate users with job roles. 








*  You can view initiative job role allocation on a linked project in the following areas of the project: 

    
    
    *  *`Scenario Planner`* section of the Project&nbsp;Details area on a project. For more information, see the following articles:
    
        
        
        *  [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](publish-scenarios-update-projects.md) 
        *  [Manage information in the project Overview area](understand-project-overview-area.md) 
        
        
    
    
      >[!TIP] {type="tip"}

      >You cannot see job role information from the project and the initiative side-by-side in the *`Scenario Planner`* section of the Project Details.
    
    
    
    *  The Role Allocation panel in the following area`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> s</MadCap:conditionalText>`:

        *  Tasks section 
        
        
          For information about how to reconcile the allocations of roles between the initiative and the linked project in the Tasks section, see [Show role allocation for projects and initiatives in the task list](show-role-allocation-task-list-nwe.md).

*  You cannot view job role allocation for a project on a linked initiative. For more information, see [Import projects to plans in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](import-projects-to-plans.md).
