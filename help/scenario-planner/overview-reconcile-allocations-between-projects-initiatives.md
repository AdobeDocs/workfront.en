You can connect projects with initiatives to ensure your strategic plans and the actual work are in sync. As you outline your strategic plans and initiatives in the *Scenario Planner* and you plan the actual work in a project, you can ensure your resources on both the project and the initiatives match, so you won't either overallocate or underutilize them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

* A plan in the *Scenario Planner* with an initiative connected to a project. 
* Required job role allocations for the initiative. 
* Tasks or issues on the project that have Planned Hours and are assigned to one of the following:

  * Job roles
  * Users associated with job roles

## Connect projects and initiatives

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can create initiatives and connect them to projects only if your organization has purchased an additional license for the *Workfront Scenario Planner*.

You can connect projects with initiatives by doing one of the following:

* Import projects into a plan, as new initiatives

  -->

  [Import projects to plans in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/import-projects-to-plans.md).

* Publish initiatives to projects

Both processes create a connection between the projects and their corresponding initiatives. After connecting them, you can manage their resource allocations by comparing them and ensuring that they match.

## Considerations about reconciling resources on linked projects and initiatives

<ul> 
 <li> <p> You can assign users, teams, and job roles to work items on a project and you can assign job roles to initiatives. As a result, you can only reconcile job roles between projects and initiatives. </p> <note type="tip">
   To reconcile the users' time on a project with role allocations on the initiatives you must associate users with job roles.
