&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, or if your company has purchased the `Workfront Scenario Planner`, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Prerequisites

Before you can request access to a plan in the `Scenario Planner`,you must have the following:

* A link to the plan.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you do not have access level rights to the `Scenario Planner` and you try to access a plan from a link, you cannot request access to the plan. Instead, a screen displays informing you to contact the `Workfront administrator`.

## Request access for plans in the `Workfront Scenario Planner`

If you do not already have permissions to a plan&nbsp;and you navigate to it from a link shared with you,&nbsp;a screen displays to inform you that you do not&nbsp;have permissions to view the plan. You are prompted to request permissions from the plan creator.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can only request permissions from the owner or creator of a plan. You cannot request permissions from other users who also have access to the plan.

To request permissions:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Click a link to a plan. </p> <p> <img src="assets/request-access-to-plan-350x277.png" style="width: 350;height: 277;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>In the <span class="bold">Request access to</span> drop-down menu, indicate what level of permissions you wish to be granted.&nbsp;Select from the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>View</li> 
   <li> <p>Manage</p> </li> 
  </ul> <p>You cannot request a permission that is higher than your access level to the <span>Scenario Planner</span>. For example, you cannot request Manage permissions if you have View access to the <span>Scenario Planner</span>. </p> <p>For information about the different levels of permissions, see <a href="../scenario-planner/share-a-plan.md" class="MCXref xref">Share a plan in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner</a>. </p> <p>For information on a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can manage access to the <span>Scenario Planner</span>, see <a href="../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-sp.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to Scenario Planner</a>. </p> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>(Optional) Enter a comment or request in the <span class="bold">Leave comment box</span>, then click <span class="bold">Request access</span>. </p> <p>The following happens:&nbsp;</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><span>Workfront</span> sends an email notification to the plan owner where they can grant the permissions requested.<br> <img src="assets/request-access-to-plan-email-350x156.png" style="width: 350;height: 156;"></li> 
   <li> <p>After the plan owner grants the permissions requested, you receive an email that the permissions have been granted if your <span>Workfront administrator</span> has the Object share to user notification enabled in your system and you enable the Someone shares an object with me email notification in your profile. </p> <p> <img src="assets/access-granted-to-plan-email-350x172.png" style="width: 350;height: 172;"> </p> </li> 
   <li>You can also grant permissions to plans from the Home area and from the <span>Workfront</span> mobile app. </li> 
  </ul> <p>For information about enabling system notifications, see <a href="../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure event notifications for everyone in the system</a>.</p> <p>For information about enabling notifications in your profile, see <a href="../workfront-basics/using-notifications/notifications-misc-information.md" class="MCXref xref">Notifications: Miscellaneous information</a>. </p> </li>
