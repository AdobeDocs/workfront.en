# Create and compare plan scenarios in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner

When you are planning your company's long-term strategy, there is a lot of information that you might not have or think of in the beginning. It takes time and experimentation to arrive at a final strategy that your stakeholders can accept. Conducting a "what if" analysis to create multiple scenarios for your plan can help you accurately predict and evaluate potential circumstances and ultimately develop the best possible plan.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="15">

  </tr> 
  <tr>

## Create scenarios

A scenario is a copy of a plan. You can create as many scenarios as you need. However, we recommend that you keep the number of scenarios to a minimum so that you can easily compare them.

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Click the <span class="bold">Main Menu</span> icon <img src="assets/main-menu-icon.png">, then click&nbsp;Scenarios.</li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Create a plan. </p> <p>For information about creating plans, see <a href="../scenario-planner/create-and-edit-plans.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and edit plans in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner</a>.</p> <p>The first plan you create is automatically saved as the "Initial scenario."</p> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Click the down-pointing arrow next to an existing scenario, then <span> click the <span class="bold">Copy</span> icon.</span></p> <p> <img src="assets/copy-scenarios-ui-and-highlighted-icon-350x95.png" style="width: 350;height: 95;"> </p> <p>This creates a new scenario with the same information as the copied scenario. It is automatically named "Scenario 2" if it's the second scenario of your plan, "Scenario 3" if it's the third, and so on. You cannot rename your scenarios.</p> </li> 
 <li value="4">Update your new scenario in any of the following ways:
  <ul>
   <li><p>Create, update, or delete initiatives</p><note type="tip">
     When you delete an initiative in a scenario it is removed only from the selected scenario, not from all the scenarios.
    </note><p>For information about creating initiatives, see <a href="../scenario-planner/create-and-edit-initiatives.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and edit initiatives in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner</a>.</p></li>
   <li>Update the priorities of your initiatives</li>
   <li>Adjust people or budget information</li>
   <li><p>Review and adjust initiative conflicts in your scenario</p><p>For information about resolving conflicts, see <a href="../scenario-planner/resolve-conflicts-in-sp.md" class="MCXref xref">Resolve initiative conflicts in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner</a>.</p></li>
  </ul></li> 
 <li value="5">Click <span class="bold">Save Plan</span> to save your changes.</li> 
</ol>

## Compare scenarios

After creating your scenarios, you can compare them to find the best one for your organization.

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to the plan for which you want to compare scenarios.</li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Compare scenarios</span>. The scenario comparison page displays. </p> <p>All existing scenarios for the plan display in a side-by-side card format. The Initial scenario is always listed first and it is static. </p> <p> <img src="assets/scenario-cards-overlapping-350x166.png" style="width: 350;height: 166;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>(Optional) Scroll to the right to view all scenario cards. </p> <p>The following information displays on a scenario card:</p>
