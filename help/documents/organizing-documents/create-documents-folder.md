# Create document folders

Documents can be organized into folders. You can create personal folders in your personal Documents area.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Organizing documents simply creates links between the documents and the objects you associate them with. It does not relocate them in the system.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Review</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> <!--
