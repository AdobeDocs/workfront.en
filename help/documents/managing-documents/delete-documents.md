# Delete Documents

You can delete documents you upload. If you're given manage access to specific documents, you can delete those as well.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p> Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> licenses*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Work</em> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents the Delete permission enabled</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <em>Workfront administrator</em> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <em>Workfront administrator</em> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher on the object that contains the Document</p> <p>Manage access with the Delete permission enabled on the Document</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
