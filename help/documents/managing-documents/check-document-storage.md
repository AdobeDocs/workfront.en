# Check document storage limits

While there are no restrictions on the types and sizes of individual files that users can upload to your Workfront instance, there is a limit on your Workfront Plan on the total amount of storage used by your Workfront instance. As an `Adobe Workfront administrator`, you monitor your instance's document storage from the Setup area.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> Workfront plan* Any 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md" class="MCXref xref">Adobe Workfront licenses overview</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a <span>Workfront administrator</span>. For information on <span>Workfront administrators</span>, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.
