# Proof a linked asset for Experience Manager Assets

After you've linked an asset from Experience Manager Assets, you can create a proof and assign users to review and add comments to the asset.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0">

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must

* Install the Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector

## Create a proof

You can create static, video, or interactive proofs.

To create a proof:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Go to the project, task, or issue where you want the proof, then click the <span class="bold">Documents</span> section.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Hover over the document, then click the <span class="bold">Create Proof</span> link that appears below the document name. </p> <note type="note">
   If you have 
   <span class="bold">Automatically generate proofs when uploading documents</span> enabled in your user profile, the system automatically creates a simple proof.
  </note> </li> 
 <li value="3">Choose one of the following:<br></li> 
 <li value="4"> 
  <table cellspacing="0"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Simple Proof</td> 
     <td>This option creates a proof with no workflow attached and applies the default proof settings. You can update the default proofsettings or add a workflow after you've created the proof. For more information on proof settings, see <a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/edit-proof-settings.md" class="MCXref xref">Edit proof settings</a>.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Advanced Proof</td> 
     <td> <p>This option allows you to configure a Basic or Advanced workflow and modify proof settings for the proof you create. For more information, see </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <p><a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/configure-basic-proof-workflow.md" class="MCXref xref">Create an advanced proof with a Basic workflow</a> </p> </li> 
       <li> <p><a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-automated-proof-workflow.md" class="MCXref xref">Create an advanced proof with an Automated workflow</a> </p> </li> 
      </ul> </td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> </li> 
</ol>

## Manage an existing proof

Once you've created a proof, you can do things like

* View current stage activity
* Update reviewers and deadlines
* Edit the workflow

For more information about how to manage an existing proof, see [Manage proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/manage-proofs-in-wf.md)

## Review a proof

Assigned reviewers can do things like

* View the asset and make comments
* Add actions to comments
* Compare versions
* Approve or reject the proof

For more information about what you can do with the proofing tool, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md)
