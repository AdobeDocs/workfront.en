  </tr> 
  <tr>

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Create a `Proof`

You can create static, video, or interactive `proofs`.

To create a proof:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Go to the project, task, or issue where you want the <span>proof</span>, then click the <span class="bold">Documents</span> section.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Hover over the document, then click the <span class="bold">Create Proof</span> link that appears below the document name. </p> <note type="note">
   If you have 
   <span class="bold">Automatically generate proofs when uploading documents</span> enabled in your user profile, the system automatically creates a simple proof.
  </note> </li> 
 <li value="3">Choose one of the following:<br></li> 
 <li value="4"> 
  <table cellspacing="0"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Simple Proof</td> 
     <td>This option creates a proof with no workflow attached and applies the default proof settings. You can update the default <span>proof</span>settings or add a workflow after you've created the <span>proof</span>. For more information on proof settings, see <a href="../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/edit-proof-settings.md" class="MCXref xref">Edit proof settings</a>.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Advanced Proof</td> 
     <td> <p>This option allows you to configure a Basic or Advanced workflow and modify proof settings for the proof you create. For more information, see </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <p><a href="../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/configure-basic-proof-workflow.md" class="MCXref xref">Create an advanced proof with a Basic workflow</a> </p> </li> 
       <li> <p><a href="../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-automated-proof-workflow.md" class="MCXref xref">Create an advanced proof with an Automated workflow</a> </p> </li> 
      </ul> </td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> </li> 
</ol>
