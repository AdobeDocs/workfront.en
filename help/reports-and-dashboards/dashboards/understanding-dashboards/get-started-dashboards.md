# Get started with dashboards {#get-started-with-dashboards}

The purpose of a dashboard is to provide quick access to information. You can gather information in reports and you can then place them on dashboards to make the information easier to access.


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following:

<table class="TableStyle-TableStyle-HeaderRow" style="mc-table-style: url('../../../Resources/TableStyles/TableStyle-HeaderRow.css');caption-side: bottom;" cellspacing="15"> 
 <caption style="text-align: left;">
  *To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.AdminWF variable varname">Workfront administrator</span>.
 </caption> 
 <col class="TableStyle-TableStyle-HeaderRow-Column-Column1" style="width: 300px;"> 
 </col> 
 <col class="TableStyle-TableStyle-HeaderRow-Column-Column1"> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr class="TableStyle-TableStyle-HeaderRow-Body-LightGray"> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-HeaderRow-BodyE-Column1-LightGray" style="font-weight: bold;"> <p><span class="mc-variable WFVariables.FullProdNameWF variable varname">Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</p> </td>

   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-HeaderRow-BodyD-Column1-LightGray"> <p>View or higher access to Reports, Dashboards, and Calendars</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.AdminWF variable varname">Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level.

  `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> For more information on creating custom sections, see  <a href="simplified-left-navigation.md" class="MCXref xref">Simplified left navigation in the new Adobe Workfront experience</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText>`
