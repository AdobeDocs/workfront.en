# Share a calendar report

You can share a calendar with other users and you can make it available publicly, allowing someone without an `Adobe Workfront` license to view it.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Review</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;Reports, Dashboards, and Calendars</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher permissions to the calendar report, with access to share</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Share a calendar with `Workfront` users

Sharing a calendar is similar to sharing other objects. For more information about sharing objects in `Adobe Workfront`, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

Calendars that have been shared with you display with an asterisk (&#42;) next to the calendar name.

 <li value="1">Go to the calendar you want to share.</li> 
 <li value="2">Click <span class="bold">Calendar Actions</span>, then click <span class="bold">Sharing</span>.</li>
