# Overview of the Resource Utilization report {#overview-of-the-resource-utilization-report}

Utilization reports enable you to view the progress or cost of one or more projects in a single report.


You must have Manage access to the projects in order to access utilization information in the `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Utilization section of the Resourcing area</MadCap:conditionalText>` . If you are still unable to access this information, contact your *`Adobe Workfront administrator`*.


For information about how to access and use the utilization report, see the article [View resource utilization information](view-utilization-information.md)
