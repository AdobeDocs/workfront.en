# Create a User Delegation report

In *Adobe Workfront*, users can delegate project, task, and issue approvals to other users to make sure that their approvals are managed when they are out of office. Users with a Plan license can create a User Delegation report to see:

* Who has delegated their task, issue, and project approvals to another user
* Which users have delegated task, issue, and project approvals assigned to them  

* The dates that the delegations start and end

To learn more about delegating approvals, see [Delegate approval request](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/delegate-approval-requests.md).
