# Create a User Delegation report

In Adobe Workfront, users can delegate project, task, and issue approvals to other users to make sure that their approvals are managed when they are out of office. Users with a Plan license can create a User Delegation report to see:

* Who has delegated their task, issue, and project approvals to another user
* Which users have delegated task, issue, and project approvals assigned to them  

* The dates that the delegations start and end

To learn more about delegating approvals, see [Delegate approval request](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/delegate-approval-requests.md).
