# Schedule an automatic report delivery

You can schedule reports to automatically deliver to users on a defined schedule, or you can manually send reports on a one-time basis. When you send a report from `Adobe Workfront`, the user receives an email with the `Workfront` report in a separate attachment.

For more information, including size limitations that can affect the delivery of your reports, see [Report delivery overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/set-up-report-deliveries.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must create a report. To learn more about creating reports, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

## Schedule a report delivery

To schedule a report for automatic delivery or to edit or delete an existing report delivery:â€‹

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Go to a report that you want to schedule for delivery.</p> <note type="note">
   Report deliveries do not contain prompts. If you wish to limit data in a report delivery, we recommend applying filters to the report that you want to send.
  </note> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Report Actions</span>, then <span class="bold">Send Report</span>.</p> <p>The <span class="bold">Send Report</span> dialog box displays.</p> <note type="tip">
   To send a report manually at any given time, go to the report, then click 
   <span class="bold">Report Actions</span> > 
   <span class="bold">Send Report</span> > 
   <span class="bold">Send Now</span>.
  </note> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Select the <span class="bold">Repeating Deliveries</span> tab.</p> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>(Conditional) To modify an existing repeating report delivery, select the report delivery in the <span class="bold">Repeating Deliveries</span> section.</p> </li> 
 <li value="5"> <p>Specify the following information:</p> 
  <table cellspacing="0"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader"> <p>Send to</p> </td> 
     <td> <p>Begin typing the name of the user, group, team, or role who you want to send the report to, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.</p> <p>Or</p> <p>Specify the email address of a person external to the <span>Workfront</span> system who you want to have access to the report.</p> <p>Repeat this process to send the report to multiple users, groups, teams, or roles.</p> <note type="note"> 
       <p>Consider the following when adding report delivery recipients:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>lf your organization restricts <span>Workfront</span> notifications to specific email domains, you may only be able to send reports to email addresses listed in the email allowlist.<p>For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> updates the email allowlist, see the section <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-email-allowlist.md#configur" class="MCXref xref">Configure your email allowlist</a>.</p></li> 
        <li> <p>Adding a large number of users as recipients can cause the delivery to fail. If you experience delivery failures, you can schedule multiple report deliveries with smaller groups of users.</p> </li> 
       </ul>

    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader"> <p>Email Message</p> </td> 
     <td> <p>Specify a message to include in the email.</p> <p>By default, the email message is:</p> <p><em>Attached is the [report frequency] report [Name of the report] generated by <span>Workfront</span> on [Date].</em> </p> <note type="note">
       For reports delivered as an Excel file only, the following message is also added to the email: "Please be aware that with MS Excel (XLS) file types, there is a limit (65,530) on the number of hyperlinks these file types support. If you exceed those limits, your file will not open and it is recommended to resend without the hyperlinks. Please go back to the report scheduler to remove hyperlinks and resend the report." The "please go back to the report scheduler" phrase is a link back to the report.

       Because system loads can affect report delivery times, there may be a delay between the scheduled time and the actual delivery time. If you need a report delivered by a specific time, we recommend scheduling the delivery prior to the time that it is needed. For example, we recommend scheduling the delivery a day prior to the date when it is needed.
