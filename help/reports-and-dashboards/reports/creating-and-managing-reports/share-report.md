# Share a report in *`Adobe Workfront`* {#share-a-report-in-adobe-workfront}

Your *`Adobe Workfront administrator`* grants users access to view or edit reports when they assign access levels. For more information about granting access to issues, see [Grant access to reports, dashboards, and calendars](grant-access-reports-dashboards-calendars.md).


Along with the access level that users are granted, you can also grant them permissions to View or Manage specific reports that you have access to share. For more information about access levels and permissions, see [How access levels and permissions work together](how-access-levels-permissions-work-together.md). 


Permissions are specific to one item in *`Workfront`* and define what actions one can take on that item.


>[!NOTE]
>
>A *`Workfront administrator`* can add or remove permissions to any items in the system, for all users, without being the owner of those items.





## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following to share objects:

## Considerations about sharing reports {#considerations-about-sharing-reports}

In addition to the considerations below, also see [Share reports, dashboards, and calendars in Adobe Workfront](permissions-reports-dashboards-calendars.md). 



*  You can share reports that you create with other individuals, teams, groups, job roles, or companies. You can also share reports others created and which were shared with you. 
*  You can also share them with your entire organization or make them public. Making a report public generates a URL that can be shared with others.
*  You can share an individual report, or you can share multiple reports from a list of reports. 




## Ways to share reports {#ways-to-share-reports}

You can share reports in  *`Workfront`* in the following way:



*  Manually, as described in the [Share a report](#share) section below. 
*  Automatically, by inheriting View permissions from a dashboard that contains the report which has been shared. For information about viewing inherited permissions on objects, see [View inherited permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](view-inherited-permissions-on-objects.md). 




## Share a report {#share-a-report}

Sharing one report or several reports from a list is identical. 



1. Go to a list of reports and select one or multiple reports, then click `Share`. 


   Or 


   Click the name of one report, then click `Report Actions >` `Sharing`.

1.  (Optional) Click the `Gear` icon ![](assets/gear-icon-settings-with-dn-arrow.jpg) in the upper-right corner of the sharing box, then select one of the following options:

      ` `**Warning: **``We recommend that you use caution when sharing an object containing confidential information with external users. This allows them to view information without being a *`Workfront`* user or part of your organization. 
    
    
      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If the report has a prompt and you share it publicly, the users running the report must be logged in to *`Workfront`* to be able to run the report using the prompt. If they cannot log in to *`Workfront`*, they will see the report without the prompt applied to it. For more information about limitations of sharing reports with prompts, see the section [Limitations of sharing prompted reports](add-prompt-report.md#limitations-of-running-public-prompted-reports) in the article [Add a prompt to a report](add-prompt-report.md).
    
    
    
    *  `Make this visible system-wide:` Select this option so that everyone in *`Workfront`* with access to reports can see the report.
    
    
      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >Users with a Request license cannot view a system-wide report. A report must be shared with the Requestors individually if they need to view it.
