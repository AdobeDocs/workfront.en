# View report usage

In order to understand how extensively reports are used in your system you can view the following information in a list of reports:

<ul> 
 <li>Last 10 users who viewed the report</li> 
 <li>View count within a specified time frame<br><note type="note"> 
   <em>Adobe Workfront</em> counts one view per user per day. If you access the same report several times a day 
   <em>Workfront</em> counts this as one view for that report for you. If the same report is accessed by another user in the same day, 
   <em>Workfront</em> counts this as a new view for the second user.
  </note></li> 
 <li>Last Viewed Date</li> 
 <li>Last Viewed By User</li> 
 <li>A list of dashboards which contain the report<br>For more information about displaying the name of the dashboards that reports might be added on in a list of reports, see the article <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/report-usage/understand-how-organize-reports-dashboard.md" class="MCXref xref">Understand how&nbsp;to organize reports on a dashboard</a>.</li> 
</ul>

You can build a view for a list of reports where you can display this information.  
You can filter a list of reports by some of these fields.  
For more information about what fields you can filter a report by, see the article [Filter a report list by usage information](#filtering-by-report-usage).

## Exceptions when viewing report usage information

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The report usage information has been collected since March 2018. Any information prior to this date is not available.

The following are some exceptions to be aware of when working with report usage information:

* Every time a report is displayed on a dashboard or a custom tab, it is counted as one view. The user who is displaying that report on their dashboard is displayed as the Last View By: Name user, and the date on which the dashboard was displayed is displayed as the Last Viewed On date.
* *Workfront* does not collect usage information for built-in reports.  
  For more information about *Workfront* built-in reports, see the article [Use Adobe Workfront built-in reports](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/use-workfront-built-in-reports.md).

* *Workfront* does not collect usage information on delivered reports. A delivered report does not count as one view.  
  For more information about delivered reports, see the article [Report delivery overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/set-up-report-deliveries.md).

* When a system or group administrator logs in as another user, the views are counted for and associated with the system or group administrator.
* *Workfront* does not collect usage information for reports by custom quarters. Only the standard built-in quarters are referenced in the report usage fields.
* *Workfront* does not collect usage information for reports that are shared and viewed publicly. When a public report is viewed by someone without logging into *Workfront*, the report views are not counted.  
  For more information about sharing reports, see the article [Share a report in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/share-report.md).
