# Overview of common uses for Text Mode

You can expand your reporting capabilities by using text mode in reports and report elements. You can also use a version of text mode to build more complex calculated custom fields. For more information about text mode, see [Text Mode overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md).

This article outlines just a few common examples of where you would most likely need to use text mode to expand reporting or calculated custom fields capabilities in `Adobe Workfront`. For a more expansive list of examples, see:

* [Custom View, Filter, and Grouping samples](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples.md) 
* [Calculated custom data in reports](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-custom-data-reports.md)

For additional real-life text mode examples that other `Workfront` customers might have identified, visit the [Text Mode Reporting Discussions](https://one.workfront.com/s/topic/0TO0z000000cdHmGAI/text-mode-reporting?tabset-21363=3) tab in  `Adobe Workfront One` or join the [ `Workfront Community`](https://one.workfront.com/s/community) (requires logging in). &nbsp;

## Instances where you might use text mode in lists and reports

We recommend that you use the report and list builder to build your views, filters and groupings. However, there are some instances where you can use text mode to enhance your reports and lists.

You can use text mode when you want to achieve the following in  `Workfront`:

* Build custom calculated custom fields in a custom form.  
  For more information about calculated custom fields, see the [Use Text Mode in calculated custom fields](#calculated-custom-fields) section in this article.
* Enhance filters, views, and groupings beyond what is possible in the report builder. For information about using text mode for filters, views, and groupings, see the following sections in this article:

  * [Use Text Mode in views](#using-text-mode-in-views) 
  * [Use Text Mode in filters](#using-text-mode-in-filters) 
  * [Use Text Mode in groupings](#using-text-mode-in-groupings)

* Create custom prompts. You can only create custom prompts using Text&nbsp;Mode.

  For information about building custom prompts, see [Add a prompt to a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/add-prompt-report.md).

## Use Text Mode in calculated custom fields

You can use text mode to add a calculated custom field to a Custom Form.

For more information about adding a calculated custom field to a Custom Form, see [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

For more information about creating a calculated custom field in text mode, see [Add calculated data to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-calculated-data-to-custom-form.md).

For example, you can add a calculated custom field that shows a time and date stamp of the moment when an item was marked as In Progress. You can use this calculation for other statuses.

For information, see [Calculated custom field example: display a Status timestamp in a Custom Form](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/example-status-timestamp-in-calculated-field.md).

<!--
Display a Status timestamp in a Custom Form
-->

<!--
Display a Status timestamp in a Custom Form The following calculated field displays the date when the specified object status was modified. Navigate to a Custom form where you want to add the field. Click Calculated to add a calculated custom field to the form. Specify a Label for the Custom Field, for example: Status Timestamp Custom Field. (Optional) Click the Name field to update it. The Name of the field matches the Label you just entered by default. Click Done. Click Save+Close. Re-open the Custom Form, and click the new Status Timestamp Custom Field on the form. In the Calculation field, specify the following calculation for your Custom Field: IF(Status='INP',IF(ISBLANK({DE:Status Timestamp Custom Field}),$$NOW,{DE:Status Timestamp Custom Field}),{DE:Status Timestamp Custom Field}) Note: You must always use the three letter key for the Status in this calculation. For more information about the keys for Statuses, see Create or edit a status. Click Save+Close. You can then report on the Status Timestamp Custom Field, or use it in other calculations in reports or Custom Fields. Note: If your status changes to INP, then another status, then back to INP, Workfront captures only the timestamp of the first change to INP.
-->

## Use Text Mode in views

You can use text mode in views to expand on the fields and objects you can display in the view.

For examples of the most common reasons for using text mode in a view, see the following articles:

* [View: display objects that are not included in the standard interface](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-display-objects-not-in-standard-interface.md) 
* [View: display the result of a calculation between two fields in a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-calculation-between-two-fields.md) 
* [View: permanently edit the width of a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-edit-column-width-permanently.md) 
* [View: merge information from multiple columns in one shared column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-merge-columns.md) 
* [View: remove link to an object in a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-remove-link-to-object.md) 
* [Reference collections in a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/reference-collections-report.md) 
* [View: hide the content of a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-hide-column-content.md) 
* [View: display an image instead of a string in a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-display-image-in-view.md) 
* [View: display task indentations in a task list](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-display-task-identations.md) 
* [View: calculate time and date differences](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-calculate-time-and-date-differences.md)

<!--
The most common reason for using text mode in a view are: Display objects that are not included in the standard interface Make a calculation between two fields in a column Edit the width of a column permanently Access requirements You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: Adobe Workfront plan* Any Adobe Workfront license* Plan Access level configurations* Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings Edit access to Reports, Dashboards, Calendars to create a view in a report Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see Create or modify custom access levels. Object permissions Manage permissions to a report to create or edit a view in a report Manage permissions to a view to edit it For information on requesting additional access, see Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront. *To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator. Edit the width of a column permanently Merge multiple columns into a single column Remove a link to an object from the view Display a collection in a view Hide the content of a column in a view Display an image in a view Display task indentations in a view Calculate time and date differences
-->

<!--
Display objects that are not included in the standard interface You can display objects in a view that are not included in the standard mode interface. Some objects can be included in a view only by referencing them via text mode. You can know which fields can be included in a view in either of the following ways: Use the API Explorer to discover other objects that can be referenced via text mode. Not all the fields documented in the API Explorer are valid fields for text mode. Some fields are only reportable through the API. A column or field name is not available in the standard mode interface, but the column or field ID is. Most objects that have a column or field ID also have a corresponding column or field name. However, in some cases, only the ID is displayed in the standard mode Interface. You can use text mode to include the column or field name in a view by replacing the fieldnameID with the fieldname:name. For example, in the standard mode interface, the Sponsor ID field is available for a project, but the Sponsor Name field is not. You can use text mode to display the Sponsor Name, if you switch the Sponsor ID column to text mode and replace the text in the column with: valuefield=project:sponsor:name querysort=project:sponsor:name valueformat=HTML displayname=Project Sponsor Name linkedname=project namekey=view.relatedcolumn namekeyargkey.0=project namekeyargkey.1=sponsorID Make a calculation between two fields in a column For example, if you want to find out the number of week days that elapsed between two dates, you can use text mode syntax and data expressions to calculate this difference. For example, we want to calculate the week day difference between the Planned Completion Date and the Actual Completion Date of a task. To do this, you can add a new column to a task view, and Switch to Text Mode. In the Click to edit text dialog box, paste the following text: displayname=Week Day Difference textmode=true valueexpression=WEEKDAYDIFF({plannedCompletionDate},{actualCompletionDate}) valueformat=HTML You can use any other two dates in this calculation (Actual Start, Actual Completion, Projected Start, Projected Completion, etc). For more information about calculated data expressions, see Calculated data expressions. Edit the width of a column permanently You can permanently change the width of a column by using these lines in the text mode of the column: width=200 usewidths=true For the width line, specify any number (in pixels), according to how wide you want the column to display in the report. Merge multiple columns into a single column Merge data from two columns with a line break Merge data from two columns with no line break Merge data from two columns with a line break Do the following to share the data from multiple columns to display it in one common column with a line break between the values from each column: Add a third column between the two columns you want to merge. Add the following code in the middle column: value=<br> valueformat=HTML width=1 sharecol=true Add the following text to the first column: sharecol=true
-->

<!--
Merge data from two columns with no line break You can share the data from multiple separate columns to display it in one column with no breaks or spaces between the values from each column. To do this: Add the following text to the first column: sharecol=true Note: Consider the following when using shared columns: The valueformat=HTML line is mandatory in a shared column. Otherwise, the columns contain no information (they will be blank) when the report is exported from Workfront. Conditional formatting may not be supported in merged columns. Columns with the viewalias attribute can limit the amount of columns that you can merge. To avoid these limits, avoid using the viewalias attribute. If you must include the viewalias attribute in a column, make sure that they are the last item listed in the column. Remove a link to an object from the view Some objects that you display in a view are links to the Details page of the object, by default. For example, the column that displays the Name of a project is a link to the project; the column that displays the Name of a user is a link to the user profile page. You can remove this link using text mode. For example, to remove the link to a task in a project report, you may use the following text mode in a column: displayname=Task Name linkedname=direct namekey=name querysort=name textmode=true valueexpression={name} valueformat=Compound Note: You can use similar code for other objects, and just replace the valuefield line of the code with valueexpression. This removes the link from the view. Display a collection in a view Display a collection in a report view. A collection is a list of objects that are linked to one other object. For information about displaying a collection in a report view, see the "Reference collections in a View of a report" section in the article Reference collections in a report. Hide the content of a column in a view You can build a column in a view for purposes of sorting the view by a certain field, but you can use text mode to hide the information inside the column from displaying in the view. In this case, the object in the column helps sort the view, but the information of that object does not display in the view. For example, to hide the Task Number column in a task report, replace the text in the Task Number column with the following: displayname= linkedname=direct querysort=taskNumber sortOrder=1 sortType=asc textmode=true value= valueformat=int width=0 The important changes in this code which make the column hidden are: displayname: This line must be blank. valuefield: This has been replaced by value, and must be blank. width: Depending on the field, this must have a value of 0 or 1. Note: You can use hidden columns to sort by a certain object that you do not want to display in the view. For example, you can sort by Task Number in a task view in the example provided above, and hide the Task Number information from the view. When you hide a column, note that the information in the column is hidden, but the column still exists in the view.
-->

<!--
Display an image in a view You can replace the name of an object in a view with an image. Note: Images appear in their actual resolution so try to use small images. This example is for projects, but it applies to any object with a URL field. You can add it to any column to replace the value of the column with an image. To replace the name of a project in a project view with an image: Ensure that you have an image that is stored on a server accessible from Workfront. Tip: Avoid using images that are uploaded to Workfront. Because images stored in Workfront are not publicly available and have an access key that expires after a period of time, these images stop displaying in the view over time. Go to a project, click the More menu next to the name of the project, then click Edit. In the URL field, add the link to the image. Navigate to a project view in a list or report and customize the view. Click the header of the column for the Project Name, then click Switch to Text Mode. Add the following code to the column to the existing code: displayname=Link Project image.name=Link Project image.valuefield=URL link.linkproperty.0.name=projectID link.linkproperty.0.value=ID link.lookup=link.edit link.page=/view link.valuefield=objCode link.valueformat=val textmode=true type=image valueformat= The image you selected replaces the Project Name in the project view. Click Save View.
-->

<!--
Display task indentations in a view Add this code to the Task Name column in a task view, to display the tasks indented according to the Work Breakdown Structure of the project: valueexpression=IF({indent}<1,{name},IF({indent}<2,CONCAT(' - ',{name}),IF({indent}<3,CONCAT(' - - ',{name}),IF({indent}<4,CONCAT(' - - - ',{name}),CONCAT(' - - - - ',{name}))))) This adds up to four dashes before the task name to indicate the position of the child task. Calculate time and date differences Important: You cannot calculate the time and date difference in Workfront between two different objects of the same kind. For example, you cannot calculate the time and date difference between two dates on two different projects, tasks, or issues. You can only calculate the difference between the following: Calculate the time and date difference between two date fields on the same object Calculate the time and date difference between the field on an object and another field on the parent object Calculate the time and date difference between two date fields on the same object For example, to calculate the difference between the Planned Completion Date and the Actual Completion Date of a task add the following column to a task report: displayname=Planned-Actual Completion Date linkedname=direct querysort=plannedCompletionDate textmode=true valueexpression=ROUND(DATEDIFF({plannedCompletionDate},{actualCompletionDate}),2) valueformat=HTML The result displays in days. The timestamp on the date field is also taken into account, and the number of days might be followed by decimals if the timestamps don't match. Calculate the time and date difference between the field on an object and another field on the parent object For a list of objects and their parents, see the "Understanding the Interdependency and Hierarchy of Objects" section in Understand objects in Adobe Workfront. For example, you can calculate the difference between the Planned Completion Date of a task and the Planned Completion Date of its parent task, or of the project that the task is on. Add the following column to a task view or report to calculate the difference between the Planned Completion Date of the task and that of the parent task: valueexpression=ROUND(DATEDIFF({plannedCompletionDate},{parent}.{plannedCompletionDate}),2) textmode=true valueformat=HTML displayname=Parent Planned Completion - Planned Completion Add the following column to a task view or report to calculate the difference between the Planned Completion Date of the task and that of the project: displayname=Project Planned Completion - Planned Completion textmode=true valueexpression=ROUND(DATEDIFF({plannedCompletionDate},{project}.{plannedCompletionDate}),2) valueformat=HTML

## Use Text Mode in filters

You can use text mode when building filters to expand on the fields and objects you can filter by.

For examples of the most common reasons for using text mode in a filter, see the following articles:

* [Filter: create multiple filter rules that reference the same field ("AND" statements)](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-refrence-the-same-field-multiple-times.md) 
* [Filter: display only items in an approval status](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-for-items-in-approval-status.md) 
* [Filter: display items by same-name statuses when the statuses are associated with different groups](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-same-name-statuses-from-different-groups.md) 
* [Filter: eliminate items in a list by comparing two fields](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-items-by-comparing-two-fields.md) 
* The section [Examples of text mode filters that span multiple levels in the object hierarchy](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md#examples) in the article [Create complex Text Mode filters using EXISTS statements](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md)
* The section [Create complex text mode filters for missing objects](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md#missing-object-filters) in the article [Create complex Text Mode filters using EXISTS statements](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md)

<!--
The most common reasons for using text mode in a filter are: Create multiple Filter Rules that reference the same field Filter for items in an approval status Filter for items by same-name statuses when the statuses are associated with different groups Filter items by comparing two fields Creating Complex Text-Mode Filters that Span Multiple Levels in the Object Hierarchy Creating Complex Text-Mode Filters for Missing Objects Create multiple Filter Rules that reference the same field In the standard mode interface, when attempting to create multiple filters that reference the same field (using the AND qualifier), one of the filters is deleted when you save the report and exit the report builder. For example, Workfront does not allow you to save the following filter rules using the standard mode interface: Task Name > Contains > Green Task Name > Does Not Contain > Red However, you can create these filters using text mode: name=green name_Mod=cicontains AND:1:name=red AND:1:name_Mod=cinotcontains Filter for items in an approval status To display only items in a certain status which is currently in Pending Approval: Go to the filter you want to customize for a list of projects, for example. This works the same for any other object with an approval status. Add a Filter Rule for the Status field of the object of your list. For example, in a project report, add Status Equal Planning, if you want to display only projects which are in a status of Planning - Pending Approval. Click Switch to Text Mode. Modify the status line by adding a :A to the three letter key of the status: status=PLN:A status_Mod=in Click Save Filter. You can use the same steps to filter for all statuses of all objects that could be associated with an approval process. Filter for items by same-name statuses when the statuses are associated with different groups You can have a task status assigned to Group A named New Status with the three-letter key NST. You may have another task status assigned to Group B also named New Status with the three-letter key NES. Although the names for the two statuses can be identical, the three letter code is always unique. For more information about group statuses, see Create or edit a group status. To distinguish between the two statuses in our example you can modify the text mode of the filter applied to a task list to ensure items in both statuses are identified: Go to the filter you want to customize for a list of tasks, for example. This works the same for projects and issues, as well. Add a Filter Rule for the Status field of the object of your list. For example, in a task report, add Status Equal New Status, if you want to display only tasks which are in a status of New Status. Notice that you have only one option for a status named New Status. Click Switch to Text Mode. The following code should display: status=NST status_Mod=in Note: Only one status displays here. The status line displays one of the three-letter keys for one of the statuses. Add the following two lines of code to add the status that is missing from the filter: status=NST status_Mod=in OR:1:status=NES OR:1:status_Mod=in Click Save Filter. Filter items by comparing two fields For example, you can display only tasks where the Actual Completion Date of the task is greater than the Planned Completion Date: Go to the filter you want to customize on a task list, for example. Click Add Filter Rule for the Actual Completion Date field. Click Switch to Text Mode. Replace the text with the following code: actualCompletionDate=FIELD:plannedCompletionDate actualCompletionDate_Mod=gt Click Save Filter. Create complex Text Mode filters that span multiple levels in the object hierarchy Using EXISTS statements in the text mode interface, you can filter for objects that are removed from the filter object by more than two levels of hierarchy. For information about filtering across multiple levels of object hierarchy, see the section Examples of text mode filters that span multiple levels in the object hierarchy in the article Create complex Text Mode filters using EXISTS statements. Create complex Text Mode filters for missing objects Using EXISTS statements in the text mode interface, you can filter for objects that are missing. For example, you can display a list of users who did not log time in Workfront within a certain period of time or a list of custom fields that are not associated with any custom forms. For information about filtering for missing objects, see the section Create complex text mode filters for missing objects in the article Create complex Text Mode filters using EXISTS statements.

## Use Text Mode in groupings

You can use text mode when building groupings to expand on the fields and objects you can group by in lists and reports.

For examples of the most common reasons for using text mode in a grouping, see the following articles:

* [Grouping: organize list results by a calculated value common to all objects in the grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-by-calculated-common-values.md) 
* [Grouping: add a fourth grouping to a list](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-add-fourth-grouping.md) 
* [Grouping: edit the display name in a grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-rename-grouping.md)

<!--
The most common reasons for using text mode in a grouping are: Group results by a calculated value common to all objects in the grouping Add a fourth grouping in a standard report Rename a Grouping Indicate whether the results in a Grouping should be collapsed or expanded Group results by a calculated value common to all objects in the grouping For example, you might want to view your tasks grouped by Percent Complete in ranges of 0-25, 26-50, 51-75, 75-99, and 100. Doing so would require using text mode for your grouping. The grouping that you want to use for this example is: textmode=true group.0.valueexpression=IF({percentComplete}>=0&&{percentComplete}<=25,'0-25%',IF({percentComplete}>25&&{percentComplete}<=50,'26-50%',IF({percentComplete}>50&&{percentComplete}<=75,'51-75%',IF({percentComplete}>75&&{percentComplete}<=100,'76-100%','')))) group.0.linkedname=direct group.0.valueformat=doubleAsString group.0.namekey=percentComplete Add a fourth grouping in a standard report You can have four groupings in a matrix report. For more information about matrix reports, see Create a matrix report. You can only have three groupings in a standard report through the standard interface. To add a fourth grouping in a standard report, you must use text mode. For example, you have a task report which is grouped by Project Name, Progress Status and Planned Completion Date. You want to add a fourth grouping, for Assigned To Name. You can do that, with the following code inside your grouping builder: group.0.linkedname=project group.0.namekey=view.relatedcolumn group.0.namekeyargkey.0=project group.0.namekeyargkey.1=name group.0.valuefield=project:name group.0.valueformat=string group.1.enumclass=com.attask.common.constants.ProgressStatusEnum group.1.enumtype=TASK group.1.linkedname=direct group.1.namekey=progressStatus group.1.type=enum group.1.valuefield=progressStatus group.1.valueformat=val group.2.groupdatesby=WY group.2.linkedname=direct group.2.namekey=plannedCompletionDate group.2.notime=false group.2.valuefield=plannedCompletionDate group.2.valueformat=atDateAsWeekString group.3.valuefield=assignedTo:name group.3.valueformat=HTML textmode=true Rename a Grouping You can rename groupings to something more familiar to your users. To do that, you can do one of the following in a grouping: When customizing a grouping, click Switch to Text Mode. Remove all the lines in the text mode interface of the grouping that have the word "name" in them, then add the line: group.0.name=Your Value You can also leave the group.0.name line blank, in which case the grouping shows the name of the value you are grouping by. Or Add the following line to the existing text mode code in a Grouping: group.0.displayname=Your Value Indicate whether the results in a Grouping should be collapsed or expanded You can indicate whether the results in a grouping should display collapsed or expanded in a list or report. The results in a grouping display expanded, by default. For information about creating a grouping, see Create groupings. When customizing a grouping, click Switch to Text Mode. Add the code for your custom grouping, then add the following line for a first-level grouping: group.0.iscollapsed=true to display the grouping collapsed Or group.0.iscollapsed=false to display the grouping expanded. Click Done, then Save Grouping when you modify the grouping in a list. Or Click Done, then Save + Close when you modify the grouping in a report. Tips: When you manually adjust groupings when viewing a list, Workfront remembers your manual preference until you log out. When you log back in, the list displays according to this setting. The results of a grouping always display expanded after accessing them from a chart element.
