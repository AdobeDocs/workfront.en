# Delete filters

The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

You can delete filters when they are no longer needed.

Consider the following when deleting filters:

* Deleted filters are removed from `Adobe Workfront` for everyone who has access to view them.
* Deleted filters are removed from the global list of filters and those associated with a Layout Template. 
* You cannot recover deleted filters.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Request</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings. </p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to a filter</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Prerequisites

Deleting filters is possible only when the following conditions are met:

* You access filters from the following lists of objects:&nbsp;projects, tasks, or issues.

* You enable the `beta builder` interface to view available filters in the system. For information about the types of filter-building interfaces, see [Create or edit filters in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-filters.md).

## Delete a filter

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Go to a list of projects, tasks, or issues.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p> Click the <span class="bold">Filter</span> icon <img src="assets/filter-nwepng.png">, then enable the <span class="bold">Beta setting</span><img src="assets/beta-toggle-white-on-existing-filters.png"> to access the <span>beta builder</span>. It is disabled by default. </p> <p>This opens the beta filter builder interface. </p> <note type="tip">
   The header of the filter builder interface changes to blue when you enable the 
   <span>beta builder</span>. After you enabled the 
   <span>beta builder</span> interface, 
   <span>Workfront</span> keeps it enabled for all areas where it is available.
