# Views overview in *`Adobe Workfront`* {#views-overview-in-adobe-workfront}

You can customize the type of information you display in a list or report by managing the view of the list or report. You can display objects and their attributes in a view. For information about the objects of *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](understand-objects.md). 


## Considerations about views {#considerations-about-views}




* You can customize existing views. All users who can view the views can also see your changes.
*  Your *`Adobe Workfront administrator`* must grant you access to edit filters, views, and groupings to be able to create views.


  For information about granting edit access, see [Grant access to filters, views, and groupings](grant-access-fvg.md).

* Your level of permissions to a view dictates how a view is saved. If you created the view originally, you can save the changes, otherwise you are prompted to save a version of the view. If you make changes to a view you have shared with others it impacts them as well.
* You can customize a view that was shared with you only if the user who shared it granted you Manage access. For information about sharing a view, see [Share a filter, view, or grouping in Adobe Workfront](share-filter-view-grouping.md).


You can customize existing views, create new views based on existing views, or create new views from scratch.
