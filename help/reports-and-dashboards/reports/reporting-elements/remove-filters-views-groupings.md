You can remove a filter, view, or grouping from the drop-down menus of lists and reports if you created them or they have been shared with you. You cannot remove default filters, views, or groupings.

## Walk-through

View the following video to learn how to remove filters, views, and groupings in *Adobe Workfront*.

>[!NOTE]

>The video describes how to remove a grouping. However, removing views and filters is identical to removing a grouping.

This video was recorded in *Workfront Classic*. However, the content also applies to *the new Workfront experience*.

## How-to steps

How you remove a reporting element depends on whether you initially created it, or it was shared with you.

For example, when removing a grouping:

* `If you created the grouping and you remove it`, the grouping is removed from the *Workfront* system. The grouping is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with.

* `If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it`, the grouping is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping.

To remove a filter, view, or grouping:

1. Go to a list of objects or a report.
1. In the `Grouping`, `Filter`, or `View` drop-down menus, click `Remove Grouping`, `Remove Filter`, or `Remove View`.

   The `My Groupings`, `My Filters,` or `My Views`dialog box displays.

   All reporting elements that you have rights to remove are available to remove. Other reporting elements are displayed as dimmed.

1. Click the `x` icon next to any reporting element that you want to remove, then click `Done`.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Request</em> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <em>Workfront administrator</em> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <em>Workfront administrator</em> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions with access to share to the filter, view, or grouping you want to remove</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.

## Considerations about removing filters, views, and groupings

How you remove a reporting element depends on whether you initially created it, or it was shared with you.

The following scenarios exist when you remove a grouping:

* `If you created the grouping and you remove it`, the grouping is removed from the *Workfront* system. The grouping is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with.

* `If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it`, the grouping is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping.
