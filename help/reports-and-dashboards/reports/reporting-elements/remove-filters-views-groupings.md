# Remove filters, views, and groupings {#remove-filters-views-and-groupings}


You can remove a filter, view, or grouping from lists and reports if you created them or they have been shared with you. You cannot remove default filters, views, or groupings.


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following:

<table style="width: 100%;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('../../../Resources/TableStyles/TableStyle-List-options-in-steps.css');" class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps" cellspacing="0"> 
 <col class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-Column-Column1"> 
 </col> 
 <col class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-Column-Column2"> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-Body-LightGray"> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyE-Column1-LightGray" role="rowheader"><span class="mc-variable WFVariables.FullProdNameWF variable varname">Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyD-Column2-LightGray"> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-Body-MediumGray"> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyE-Column1-MediumGray" role="rowheader"><span class="mc-variable WFVariables.FullProdNameWF variable varname">Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyD-Column2-MediumGray"> <p><span class="mc-variable WFVariables.WFLicense-Request variable varname">Request</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-Body-LightGray"> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyE-Column1-LightGray" role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyD-Column2-LightGray"> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.AdminWF variable varname">Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.AdminWF variable varname">Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-Body-MediumGray"> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyB-Column1-MediumGray" role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyA-Column2-MediumGray"> <p>View permissions with access to share to the filter, view, or grouping you want to remove</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your *`Workfront administrator`*.


## Considerations about removing filters, views, and groupings {#considerations-about-removing-filters-views-and-groupings}

How you remove a reporting element depends on whether you initially created it, or it was shared with you. 


The following scenarios exist when you remove a grouping: 



* `If you created the grouping and you remove it`, the grouping is removed from the *`Workfront`* system. The grouping is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with.

* `If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it`, the grouping is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping.




## Remove a filter, view, or grouping  {#remove-a-filter-view-or-grouping}

Removing filters, views, or groupings in *`Workfront`* is identical.



1.  Go to a list of objects or a report.
1.  (Conditional) From a list, click the `Filter`, `View`, or `Grouping` icon, then hover over the filter, view, or grouping you want to remove, click the `More` icon ![](assets/more-icon.png), then `Remove`. The filter, view, or grouping is removed. 
1.   `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> (Conditional) From a report, c</MadCap:conditionalText>`lick the `Grouping`, `Filter`, or `View` drop-down menu and select `Remove Grouping`, `Remove Filter`, or `Remove View`.


   The `My Groupings`, `My Filters,`or `My Views` dialog box displays.


   All reporting elements that you have rights to remove are available to remove. Other reporting elements are displayed as dimmed.

1.  Click the `x` icon next to any reporting element that you want to remove. 
1.  (Conditional) Click `Yes, Delete it` if you selected to delete a filter, view, or grouping that you created and later shared with others. This deletes the filter, view, or grouping from the *`Workfront`* system.

   ` `**Tip: **`` 
   Removing a filter, view, or grouping that you created without sharing it with others removes it from the system without asking for a confirmation. 

1.  Click `Done`.
