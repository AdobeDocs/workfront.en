# Reporting elements overview {#reporting-elements-overview}

All *`Adobe Workfront`* reports are a combination of 3 essential elements:



* A view
* A filter
* A grouping


Optionally, you can also add prompts and charts to reports. 


For information about creating prompts, see [Add a prompt to a report](add-prompt-report.md). 


For information about creating a chart in a report, see [Add a chart to a report](add-chart-report.md).
