# List your reports in `Reporting Canvas`

You can view a list of all reports created by you, all public reports, or all reports. In the list, the row for each report includes the following information:

* The last user who updated the report and when the update occurred.
* The number of the report's views.
* A line visualization showing how the reports' views have trended over time.

  For example, the line might show a recent decline in views, indicating that you need to improve the report's usefulness or archive it.

When you list your reports, you can also search for reports and use tags
