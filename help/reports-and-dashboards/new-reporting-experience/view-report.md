The Reporting Canvas allows you more control over what displays when you view a report. For example, you can display it based on specific teams, date ranges, and other criteria.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

   <td> <p>Any</p> </td>

   <td> <p>Plan</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to create reports, calendars, and dashboards</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>
