## Create a formula field for a report

1. Start creating or editing a report table, as described in [Add or edit a report table in Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/add-or-edit-report-table.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the table was already added when you opened the report, the Edit button does not display. To edit the table, click the Edit icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png) in the table header.

   <!--
   In the new window that opens, drag or double-click [not sure if double-click will work] any Function or Field available in the system to add it to your formula field. Describe how to use the field definition area and field preview area as these become more developed in the UI A good example here would be helpful.
