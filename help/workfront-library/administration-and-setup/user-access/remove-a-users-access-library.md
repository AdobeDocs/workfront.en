# Remove a user's access to Workfront Library

As a Workfront Library administrator, you can remove a user's access to Workfront Library. When you remove a user from Workfront Library, only their access to Workfront Library is removed. Their Workfront account remains active. Any content that they owned in Workfront Library remains in Workfront Library.

If a Workfront system administrator deactivates a user in Workfront, they automatically lose access to Workfront Library.

>[!TIP]
>
>Before deleting or deactivating a user in Workfront or in Workfront Library, we recommend reassigning the content they own to another Workfront Library user. To access content owned by a deactivated user, users must have View or Manage access to the content. Only users with Manage access can make changes to content owned by a deactivated user.  
>For information on changing the ownership of content, see [Transfer ownership assets to another user](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/manage-assets/transfer-ownership-to-others.md).

A user might have multiple access levels assigned to them. For example, a user can have individual access to Workfront Library and access from any job role, team, group, or company that they are members of. For information on the differences between individual and user grouping access, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>To determine how a user has access to Workfront Library, you can open the Library menu and go to `Setup` > `Access` > `Users`. In the Users area, you see a list of users and the type of access they have is listed in the Access Sources column.

1. (Optional) If the user owns assets and doesn't have access through a user grouping, you must select what you would like to do with the assets:

  * Transfer the assets to a different user
  * Delete the assets
  * Keep the assets without transfering them to a new owner

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you choose to keep the assets assigned to the user that you're removing, you can transfer the assets later. If you select to transfer the assets now, you must select a new owner to assign them to.

## Remove access for a user grouping

As a Workfront Library administrator, you can remove access to Workfront Library for an entire group of users based on their user groupings:

* Job role
* Team
* Group
* Company

Users who are members of the removed user grouping lose their access to Workfront Library and all the content shared with the grouping, unless they have individual access to Workfront Library or access through another user grouping in Workfront Library. For information on Workfront Library access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't want specific users to access Workfront Library through a job role, team, group, or company, you need to remove them from that specific user grouping in Workfront. To learn how to make these changes from the user profile, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).  
>Alternatively, you can remove them from a user grouping by modifying the job role, team, group, or company that they are a member of. To learn more, see:
