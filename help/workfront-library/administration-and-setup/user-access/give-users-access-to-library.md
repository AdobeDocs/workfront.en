# Give users access to `Workfront Library`

Before users can open `Workfront Library`, they must be given access. As a `Workfront Library administrator`, you can give your users the following types of access:

* `Individual`: Access that you grant to individual users
* `User grouping`: Access that users receive through their membership in a job role, team, group, or company that you've added to `Workfront Library`

When you add individual users and user groupings to `Workfront Library`, you assign them an access level. This access level determines what actions users can take with the content that is shared with them. For information on `Workfront Library` access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md) and [Permissions in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/permissions-in-workfront-library.md).

Each access level grants specific permissions that affect what a user can do with the assets shared with them. For information on the permissions allowed for each access level, see

>[!NOTE]
>
>Users must first have a profile in `Workfront` before you can give them access to `Workfront Library`. For information on adding users to `Workfront`, see [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).

## Give individual access

To get individual access to `Workfront Library`, a user must be active in `Workfront`. You can also restore access for a user you have removed from `Workfront Library` previously.
