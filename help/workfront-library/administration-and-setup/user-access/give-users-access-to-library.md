# Give users access to *`Workfront Library`* {#give-users-access-to-workfront-library}

Before users can open *`Workfront Library`*, they must be given access. As a *`Workfront Library administrator`*, you can give your users the following types of access:



* `Individual`: Access that you grant to individual users
* `User grouping`: Access that users receive through their membership in a job role, team, group, or company that you've added to *`Workfront Library`*



When you add individual users and user groupings to *`Workfront Library`*, you assign them an access level. This access level determines what actions users can take with the content that is shared with them. For information on *`Workfront Library`* access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](user-access-overview.md) and [Permissions in Workfront Library](permissions-in-workfront-library.md).


Each access level grants specific permissions that affect what a user can do with the assets shared with them. For information on the permissions allowed for each access level, see
