# Determine the display order of taxonomy fields in Workfront Library

When a user uploads new content to Workfront Library or opens an existing content file, the taxonomy associated with the content displays in the Details panel.

As a Workfront Library administrator, you can determine the order that taxonomy fields display in the Details panel.
