# Edit a taxonomy metadata field in Workfront Library

As your organization's digital content collection grows in Workfront Library, you might find that your taxonomy needs to be updated. Only a Workfront Library administrator can edit taxonomy. For more information about taxonomy, see [Overview of taxonomy metadata in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/taxonomy-metadata-overview.md).

You can make the following modifications to a taxonomy field:

<ul> 
 <li>Change the field name</li> 
 <li> <p>Add or delete values in a single- or multi-select field</p> <note type="tip">
   You cannot change a single-select field to be a multi-select field, or a multi-select field to be a single-select field. 
  </note> </li> 
</ul>

* Enable or disable the Required Field toggle

Any changes you make to the taxonomy are applied to the metadata of all new assets uploaded. The changes do not apply to assets already in Workfront Library. However, when a user opens an asset that was in Workfront library prior to the changes you made to the taxonomy, the modified taxonomy is applied to the asset's Detail panel.

 <li value="5"> <p>Make the desired changes, then click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</p> <note type="note">
   If you edit the value for a multi- or single-select custom field, you must press 
   <span class="bold">Enter</span> to save the value.
