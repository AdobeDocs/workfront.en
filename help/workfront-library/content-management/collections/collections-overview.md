# Overview of collections in *Workfront Library*

Depending on the amount of content your organization stores in *Workfront Library*, you might have to search through hundreds of folders containing thousands of assets in order to find the items you need for your work.

Collections allow you to gather and organize related content one place and, if desired, share the content with team members and other users.

A collection does not contain the actual content files. Instead, it contains links to the content. For more information, see [Create a collection in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/collections/create-a-collection.md).

The Collections area displays all the collections that you have created and that have been shared with you.

Your *Workfront Library* access level and the permissions you have to a collection determine the activities you can do with the collection. If you have Manager access or higher to *Workfront Library*, you can create, manage, and share collections that you create. Users with Viewer access can create collections for their personal use, but cannot share their collections with other users. For more information on access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md)

When you share a collection with another user, you give that user access to all the items in the collection and you assign them a permission level to the collection. Their permissions determine the activities they can do with the collection and its contents.

You search for a collection by its name. For information on using the Search feature, see [Search for items in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/basics/search-for-items-in-workfront-library.md)

Depending on your access level to *Workfront Library*, you can manage a collection in the following ways:
