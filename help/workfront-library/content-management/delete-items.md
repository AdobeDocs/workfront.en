# Delete items from *Workfront Library*

As a *Workfront Library administrator*, you can delete assets, folders, and collections in *Workfront Library*.

You can delete only the active (or current) version of an asset in *Workfront Library*. Older versions of a deleted asset remain in *Workfront Library* and cannot be deleted.

When you delete a container such as a folder or a collection, the items within the deleted container remain in *Workfront Library*. Users who had permissions to the deleted container loose access to the items that were linked to the container, unless they have explicit access to the items or have permissions through another folder or collection. For more information on access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md)

When you delete an asset that is also linked to a Workfront object, such as a project, task or issue, the asset remains with the object in Workfront and only the link between *Workfront Library* and the asset in Workfront is deactivated. For information on deleting content in Workfront, see [Delete Documents](../../documents/managing-documents/delete-documents.md).

Users with permissions to an item that is deleted do not receive notification of its deletion.

Currently, you cannot restore a deleted item.
