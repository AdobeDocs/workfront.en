# Create a folder in *Workfront Library*

If you have Manager or higher access to *Workfront Library* you can create folders to organize content. By nesting folders, you can create a folder structure that makes finding content quick and easy.

When you create a folder, you have the option to select the image you want as the folder cover image. If you don't select a cover image, the folder thumbnail is gray as long as the folder remains empty. When you upload content to the folder, *Workfront Library* randomly selects a cover image from the files uploaded to the folder. If a folder contains only subfolders, the cover remains gray.

For information on changing the cover image, see [Change the cover image on an item in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/change-cover-image-of-folder.md).

Users with Manager or high access can create an unlimited number of folders. Users with Viewer access cannot create folders.

&nbsp;For more information about folders, see [Overview of folders in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/folders/folders-overview-library.md).
