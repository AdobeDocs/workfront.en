# Upload a new version of content in *Workfront Library*

If you have Manage permissions to content, you can upload new versions. For information on managing multiple versions of content, see [Overview of content versioning in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/content-versioning/content-versioning-overview.md) .

You cannot upload new versions of content in bulk. Each version must be uploaded individually.
