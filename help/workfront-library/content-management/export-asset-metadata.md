# Export asset metadata from Workfront Library {#export-asset-metadata-from-workfront-library}

You can export Workfront Library asset metadata from the list view. Consider the following when exporting metadata:



* Exporting metadata from the Workfront Library list view creates a CSV showing all metadata fields for the assets listed in the list view. You can select which assets are included by using filters. You cannot select which metadata fields are included.
* You can only export metadata for assets in Workfront Library. Folders can't be exported.
* Exported Library metadata files are available for download for 72 hours after they are created.
