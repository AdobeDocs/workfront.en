# Add a Workfront Library asset to Workfront

You can add a document that resides in your My Content area to a project, task, or issue in `Workfront`. In order to add a document to `Workfront` from `Workfront Library`, you must have the following permissions:

* Manage access to the document in `Workfront Library`
* Access to the `Workfront` object to which you want to add the document

When you add a document from `Workfront Library` to `Workfront`, `Workfront` creates a copy of the document. This copy is not linked to the document in `Workfront Library`, and changes made to one copy of the document are not updated in the other copy. Additionally, if you send a new version of a document that is already in `Workfront`, the new version is uploaded as a separate file with the same name as the original version.

To learn how to send a document from `Workfront` to `Workfront Library`, see [Send documents from Workfront to Workfront Library](../../workfront-library/content-management/send-documents-from-wf-to-library.md).
