# Create and manage views in Workfront Library

## Views in *Workfront Library*

Workfront Library allows you to select the view you want to use, so that the information you need is readily available. There are two types of views:

<ul> 
 <li><span class="bold">Grid view</span><span class="bold">:</span> The default view, which shows thumbnails of your <em>Workfront Library</em> assets. To switch to grid view, click the <span class="bold">Show grid view</span> icon <img src="assets/grid-view-icon.png">.</li> 
 <li><span class="bold">List view</span><span class="bold">:</span> Allows you to see more details about your library assets at a glance. You can save customized list views, as well as export asset metadata from the list view. To switch to the list view, click the <span class="bold">Show list view</span> icon <img src="assets/list-view-icon.png">.</li> 
</ul>

## Create a custom list view

You can customize a list view to show the metadata you choose and save it for later viewing. Saved list views save a specific arrangement of columns for a specific set of assets.

To create a custom list view:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>In the upper-left corner of <em>Workfront Library</em>, click the <span class="bold">Menu</span> icon <img src="assets/library-menu-icon.png">.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Select the area where the assets you want to view are located.</p> <p> <img src="assets/grid-view-match-list-view-350x220.png" style="width: 350;height: 220;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>(Conditional) If you are in the grid view, click the <span class="bold">Show List View</span> icon <img src="assets/list-view-icon.png"> to switch to list view.</p> <p> <img src="assets/list-view-350x121.png" style="width: 350;height: 121;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="4">Do any of the following:
  <ul>
   <li>Filter for the items you want to display. For more information, see <a href="../../workfront-library/content-management/basics/filter-content-displayed.md" class="MCXref xref">Filter content displayed in Workfront Library</a>.</li>
   <li>Select the columns you want to display by clicking the <span class="bold">Toggle Columns</span> icon <img src="assets/columns-icon.png"> and selecting your columns from the drop-down list. The available columns are based on the metadata available for your assets. The columns will appear in the order they are in the list, and the order cannot be changed.</li>
   <li>Modify the column width by moving your mouse to the header row, hovering over the border of the column you want to resize, and dragging the border to resize the column.</li>
  </ul></li> 
 <li value="5">To save this view, click the <span class="bold">Saved views</span> icon <img src="assets/saved-views-icon.png">, type a name into the <span class="bold">New view name</span> field in the drop-down menu, and click <span class="bold">Saved view</span>.</li> 
</ol>

## Return to a saved list view

<ol> 
 <li value="1">(Conditional) If you are in the grid view, click the <span class="bold">Show List View</span> icon <img src="assets/list-view-icon.png"> to switch to list view.</li> 
 <li value="2">Click the <span class="bold">Saved views</span> icon <img src="assets/saved-views-icon.png">.</li> 
 <li value="3">Select the desired saved view from the drop-down menu.</li> 
</ol>
