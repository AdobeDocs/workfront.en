 <li value="2">In either the <span class="bold">Library</span> or <span class="bold">My Content</span> area, find the folder and double click to open it.</li> 
 <li value="3">Find the asset you want to remove, then right click and select <span class="bold">Remove from folder</span>.<br><img src="assets/remove-from-folder-library-350x222.png" style="width: 350;height: 222;"></li>
