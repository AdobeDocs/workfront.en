# Open a `Workfront Library` portal

When a `Workfront Library administrator` adds you to a portal, Workfront sends you an email invitation with a link that opens the portal.

Before you can open a portal, you must be given access to it by your `Workfront Library administrator` or a user with Manager access to the portal. For information on inviting users to a portal, see [Give users access to a Workfront Library portal](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/give-users-access-portal.md).

## Open a portal for the first time

When you are first given access to a portal, Workfront sends you an email invitation with a link to the portal.

1. In the portal invitation email sent from Workfront, click `See Shared Content`.

   The portal opens. Your access level to assets within the portal determines the activities you can do while in the portal.
