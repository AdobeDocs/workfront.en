# Open a *`Workfront Library`* portal {#open-a-workfront-library-portal}

When a *`Workfront Library administrator`* adds you to a portal, Workfront sends you an email invitation with a link that opens the portal. 


Before you can open a portal, you must be given access to it by your *`Workfront Library administrator`* or a user with Manager access to the portal. For information on inviting users to a portal, see [Give users access to a Workfront Library portal](give-users-access-portal.md). 


## Open a portal for the first time {#open-a-portal-for-the-first-time}

When you are first given access to a portal, Workfront sends you an email invitation with a link to the portal.



1.  In the portal invitation email sent from Workfront, click `See Shared Content`.


   The portal opens. Your access level to assets within the portal determines the activities you can do while in the portal.
