# Create a request in Workfront Library

You can create a work request, such as a request for content to be created, and submit the request to a Request Queue in Workfront. You can then assign it to another user or convert it into a task in Workfront. For more information on requests, see [Overview of converting issues in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/issues/convert-issues/convert-issues.md).

Before users can create a request in Workfront Library, a Workfront system administrator must create a request queue and make it available to users. For more information on request queues, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).
