# Get started with `Workfront Library`

`Workfront Library` is designed to be your organization's digital content hub, allowing you to manage the full lifecycle of your organization's digital content.

You can use `Workfront Library` in conjunction with the workflows you have in Workfront to seamlessly manage all your assignments and to get your work done.

## Access to `Workfront Library`

To access `Workfront Library`, you need the following:

* A user profile in `Workfront Library`
* A `Workfront Library` access level

As a Workfront user, you are not automatically given access to your organization's instance of `Workfront Library`. You must be granted access by your `Workfront Library administrator` who assigns you an access level.

There are 3 access levels available, with each level allowing the user to perform specific activities in `Workfront Library`:

* `Admin`: Allows the user full access to everything in `Workfront Library`. For more information on Admin tasks, see [Administration and setup of Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/administration-and-setup-library.md). 

* `Manager`: Allows the user to upload, edit, and share items in `Workfront Library` and to any portal to which they have been given Manage permission. For more information on Manager tasks, see [Content management in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/content-management.md).

* `Viewer`: Allows the user to see and download items to which they have View permission. For information on Viewer tasks, see [Workfront Library Basics](../../../workfront-library/content-management/basics/basics.md).

For more information about access levels, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md)
