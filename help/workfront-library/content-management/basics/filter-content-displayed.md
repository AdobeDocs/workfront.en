# Filter content displayed in Workfront Library

You can use filters to reduce the amount of content that displays in the Library and My Content areas. You can also use filters to narrow Search results. For information on using Search, see [Search for items in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/basics/search-for-items-in-workfront-library.md).

The available filters display in the Filter panel on the left side of the content area.

Each filter on the Filter panel contains facets, which are filters that allow you to specify the exact content you want to view. A facet filters content based on the metadata attached to content files.

If your organization allows you to add keywords to uploaded content, you can enhance your filtering by selecting the keywords you want to filter for.
