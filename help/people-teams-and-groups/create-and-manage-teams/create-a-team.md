# Create a team

When you create a team you become the Team Owner, by default.

You can view Team Owners for all the teams when you create a report for Teams and include the Owner Name field in your report. (For more information about creating a report, see [Create a custom report](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).)

For information on how an Adobe Workfront administrator can create a team from the Setup area, see [Create a team from the Setup area](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team-from-setup.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Create a team

<ol> Click the Main Menu icon in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click Teams. Click the Switch Teams icon , then click Create New Team. 
 <li value="3">In the <span class="bold">New Team</span> box that displays, specify the following information: 
  <ul>
   <li><span class="bold">Team Name:</span> Specify a name for the new team.</li>
   <li><p><span class="bold">Group</span>: If you want to assign the team to an associated group, start typing the name of the group, then select the name when it appears.</p>You can make sure you are associating the right group with the team by hovering over it and clicking the information icon that displays next to it. This displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and its administrators. Depending on the details configured for the group, you might also see its Business Leader and description.<note type="note">
     When a team is assigned to a group or subgroup, any group administrators of that group or subgroup can manage the team without being a member of it. Group administrators can go to the Teams area from the Main Menu and click the Switch Teams arrow 
     <img src="assets/switch-team-icon.png" alt="Switch team icon"> to list all of the teams that are assigned to the groups that they manage.
