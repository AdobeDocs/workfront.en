# Create a team

When you create a team you become the Team Owner, by default.

You can view Team Owners for all the teams when you create a report for Teams and include the Owner Name field in your report. (For more information about creating a report, see [Create a custom report](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).)

For information on how an *Adobe Workfront administrator* can create a team from the Setup area, see [Create a team from the Setup area](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team-from-setup.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">
