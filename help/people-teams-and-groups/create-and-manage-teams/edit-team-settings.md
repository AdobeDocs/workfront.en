# Edit team settings

As an `Adobe Workfront administrator` or a user with a Plan or Work license, you can edit Team Settings.

You can add users to a team, set the team layout template, and set how status is recorded when work items are completed by a team.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Work</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Edit team settings

<ol> Click the Main Menu icon in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click Teams. Click the Switch team icon , then either select a new team from the drop-down menu or search for a team in the search bar. Click the More menu , then select Edit. Only team members with either a Plan or Work license see this option.

     When a team is assigned to a group or subgroup, any 
     <span>group administrators</span> of that group or subgroup can manage the team without being a member of it. 
     <span>Group administrators</span> can go to the Teams area from the Main Menu and click the Switch Teams arrow 
     <img src="assets/switch-team-icon.png" alt="Switch team icon"> to list all of the teams that are assigned to the groups that they manage.
    </note> You can make sure you are associating the right group with the team by hovering over it and clicking the information icon that displays next to it. This displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and its administrators. Depending on the details configured for the group, you might also see its Business Leader and description. </li>
