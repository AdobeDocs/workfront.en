*`Adobe Workfront`* enables you to quickly and easily send messages that are unrelated to any work item directly to other *`Workfront`* users. Messages sent as described in this section appear in the Updates tab on the user's home&nbsp;page and are visible to all users. For additional information on updates, see [Update work items and view updates](_update-work-items-and-view-updates.md).  



The user you are sending the message to receives the following types of notifications when you send a message as described in this section:



* An in-app notification, as described in [View and manage in-app notifications](view-and-manage-in-app-notifications.md)
*  An email notification


  This depends on the types of email notifications the user is configured to receive. For more information, see [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md), [View and configure event notifications for a group](view-and-configure-event-notifications-group.md), and [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).
