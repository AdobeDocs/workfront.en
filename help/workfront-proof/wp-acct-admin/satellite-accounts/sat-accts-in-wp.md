# Satellite accounts in `Workfront Proof`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product `Workfront Proof`. For information on proofing inside `Adobe Workfront`, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Satellite accounts are paid accounts that you set up and manage from within your own `Workfront Proof` account.

Your account becomes a "Hub," which is used to manage the Satellite account(s) linked to it.

There is no limit to the number of Satellite accounts you can set up, so you could create a separate account for each of your clients if you wanted.

You can add multiple users from an organization to the Satellite account and create a personalized, branded account for them to work in.&nbsp;

## Why should I set up a Satellite account?

At `Workfront`, we often get asked these questions:

* Can I create a login for each of my clients?
* How can clients login without seeing private data?
* Should I add a freelancer to my `Workfront Proof` account?

`Workfront Proof` allows you to easily share `proofs` with anyone who has a valid email address - they don't even need their own login to `Workfront Proof`.

However, there may be times when you do want the participants in your workflow to have their own login so that they have their own dashboard and can see all the `proofs` that you have shared with them all within one place.

You may also want to increase security on your `proofs` by using the Login Required setting, in which case your reviewers will need to have their own login. For more information, see [Proof security in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/managing-security/proof-security-in-workfront-proof.md).

We strongly advise you against adding external people as users in your `Workfront Proof` account, as this could give them access to information that you do not want them to see.

So, how do you set up logins for people in other organizations?

By creating Satellite accounts for your clients.
