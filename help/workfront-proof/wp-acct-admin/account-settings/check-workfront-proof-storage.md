# Check your *`Workfront Proof`* storage {#check-your-workfront-proof-storage}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *`Workfront Proof`*. For information on proofing inside *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Proofing](_proofing.md).


Your account plan comes with a fixed amount of storage. Plan storage does not renew with each subscription because  *`proofs`* and files from previous subscriptions are still saved on your account.


>[!NOTE]
>
>Your organization's *`Workfront Proof`* storage is separate from your *`Workfront`* storage.




## Checking Your Storage Amount {#checking-your-storage-amount}




1. Click `Settings` > `Account settings`.

1. Open the `History` tab.
1. View your current storage mount under `Usage stats`.  
   The Billing Administrators of your account will receive a warning email if the storage usage on your account&nbsp;reaches 75%.





## Getting More Storage {#getting-more-storage}

You can free up some storage by deleting old *`proofs`* and files from your account. Please note that items in the Trash folder (and archived *`proofs`*) count towards your Storage.&nbsp;


If you want to upgrade your account to increase your storage limit, please contact our Sales team.
