As a *Workfront Proof administrator*, you can configure *Workfront Proof* to integrate with Basecamp, Basecamp Classic, NetSuite, and *Workfront*.

After you establish the&nbsp;general connections for integration, each user can set up&nbsp;their own personal connections via the Integrations tab available on the Personal Settings page.

See the&nbsp; [Integrations articles](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000588707-Integrations) for details and instructions.
