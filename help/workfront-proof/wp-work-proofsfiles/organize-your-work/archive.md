## Manually Archiving Proofs {#manually-archiving-proofs}

If you have edit rights, you can manually archive a *`proof`* at any time. For information about edit rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).


It can take up to 24 hours for the archiving process to be completed.



1. On the Dashboard or a list view, select the checkbox for each *`proof`* you want to archive (see &nbsp; [Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof](manage-items-on-views-page.md)&nbsp;for information about list views).  

1. Select `More` > `Archive`.  
   The Archive *`proofs`* message box appears.&nbsp;

1. Click an option to specify whether you want the *`proof`* locked or unlocked while it is archived.  
   *`Workfront Proof`* archives the *`proof`* with the locking option you specify.





## Listing Archived Proofs {#listing-archived-proofs}

A *`proof`* that has been archived appears only in the `Archived *`proofs`*` view, with the archived icon to the right of the *`proof`* name.


To display the Archived *`proofs`* view:



1.  Click `Views`, then click `All items` > `Archived *`proofs`*`.  



   When you click the name of an archived *`proof`* in this list, the Proof details page appears, displaying an `Unarchive` button at the top of this page.  



   Also, if you expand the `Activity` section on this page, you can view an entry telling you when the *`proof`* was archived and who archived it.

   If the `Activity` section does not display a name of the user who archived the *`proof`*, this means that the *`proof`* was archived automatically after 60 days of inactivity.  
   To view the contents of an archived *`proof`*, you must first unarchive it.&nbsp;





## Unarchiving Proofs {#unarchiving-proofs}

Anyone can unarchive a *`proof`* at any time. This includes reviewers who are not *`Workfront Proof`* users.


To unarchive a *`proof`* from the Archived *`proofs`* view:



1. Click `Views`, then click `All items` > `Archived *`proofs`*`.

1. Click the check box next to any *`proof`* or *`proofs`* you want to unarchive.

1. Click `More`, then click `Unarchive` from the menu that appears.  
   A message appears at the top of the page to indicate that your *`proof`* is being unarchived.
