     <br>
    </note>You can also create your own views. See&nbsp;<a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/create-and-manage-custom-views.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and Manage Custom Views in Workfront Proof Proof</a> for more information. </li>
  </ul></li> 
</ol>

## Filtering Items

You can filter the information listed in a view.

<ol> 
 <ol> 
  <li value="1">Click the <span class="bold">Show filters</span>&nbsp;icon at the right top of the page (1).<br><img src="assets/filters-350x107.png" alt="Filters.png" style="width: 350;height: 107;"></li> 
  <li value="2">The filter bar (2) appears and each category has a filtering drop-down menu (3) to select your preferred value. The default value for each category is All.<br></li> <note type="note">
   &nbsp;The filter bar does not display in custom views you create. For those views,&nbsp;you can apply and edit filters in the Filters tab. For more information, see 
   <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/create-and-manage-custom-views.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and Manage Custom Views in Workfront Proof Proof</a>.
  </note> 
  <li value="3">To apply all chosen filters, click the Filter icon (4) at the end of the filtering bar.<br><img src="assets/filters-2-350x102.png" alt="Filters_2.png" style="width: 350;height: 102;"></li> 
 </ol> 
</ol>

The Filter values you select remain in effect until you change them. If you want to see and access the full list of items again, you must change all the filter values back to the default, which is `All`.

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;If you set filtering options and then hide the filtering bar by clicking the Hide filters icon (5), the bar automatically shows again if you change views. If you hide the filtering bar while all filters are set to the default all option, the filtering bar remains hidden when changing views.

## Sorting Items

When you create a new `proof` (or version) or upload a new file, it appears at the top of your All items list. The oldest item appears at the bottom of the list.&nbsp;

To view the list in a different sort order:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Do one of the following: 
  <ul>
   <li>Click one of the column headings in the list: Type, Name, Status, Decisions, or Owner. <br>For example, if you want to see the <span>proofs</span>/files in alphabetical order, click the Name heading once (1) to sort the list by name in ascending order (A - Z).<br>You can click the Proof name heading again (2) to reverse the order and display the <span>proofs</span> in descending order (Z - A).</li>
   <li>Click the down arrow in the upper-right of the Views page to sort by the creation date (Latest or Oldest) or by Type, Name, Status, Decisions, or Owner.<br><img src="assets/views-sort-down-arrow-350x124.png" alt="Views-Sort_down_arrow.png" style="width: 350;height: 124;"><br>If your column is sorted in ascending order the column header will show an upward arrow next to the column name. To reverse the order (to descending) click the relevant column header (this will show a downward arrow next to the column name).<br></li><note type="note">
    &nbsp;Changes that you make to the sort order of the items last only while you remain on the All items page. If you navigate away from the All items page and return to it later, the items are listed again in the default reverse chronological order.
