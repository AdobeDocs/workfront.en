# Delete a Proof in `Workfront Proof`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product `Workfront Proof`. For information on proofing inside `Adobe Workfront`, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Users who have edit rights on a `proof` can delete it.

For more information on edit rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md) and [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md)

When you delete a `proof` (or any other item, such as a file or folder) in your account, `Workfront Proof` moves it to the Trash. Items in the Trash can be restored easily.

For information about the Trash, see [Restore and Empty the Trash in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/restore-and-empty-trash.md).

>[!NOTE]

>&nbsp;Items stored in the Trash count towards your storage limit. To free up storage space, please empty the Trash.
