# Run Reports in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Workfront Proof enables you to view reports&nbsp;so you can track the work progress and efficiencies of your teams.

You can easily view the number of&nbsp;proofs that were&nbsp;created in your Workfront Proof account, how many versions are associated with each proof, the turnaround time, and more.

## Prerequisites

Whether reports&nbsp;are available depends on your type of Workfront Proof account and user permission levels.

* [Account Prerequisites](#account-prerequisites) 
* [User Prerequisites](#user-prerequisites)

### Account Prerequisites

Reporting&nbsp;information is available only with Premium plans.

<!--
If you want to know more, contact your Account Manager.
-->

### User Prerequisites

Reporting&nbsp;information is available only to users with full access to all proofs on your account (i.e. users with at least [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md)).

In this panel you can

* Control the time span of the displayed data
* Analyze changes in metrics over time
* Check the details of a selected point in time by hovering over it
* Check the total number of proofs created in your selected time span
* Check the average number of versions included in the completed sets of proofs
