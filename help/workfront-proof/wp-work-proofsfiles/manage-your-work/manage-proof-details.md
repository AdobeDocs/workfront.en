# Manage Proof Details in `Workfront Proof`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product `Workfront Proof`. For information on proofing inside `Adobe Workfront`, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

The Proof details page lets you manage an existing `proof`. For example, you can add new reviewers, amend the deadline, change the settings you originally set for the `proof`, and check what activity has occurred on that `proof`.

The Proof details page is particularly useful for people in charge of projects, who need to keep track of all changes on a `proof`. On this page, they can find everything they need to know about a `proof` in just a few clicks.

To find out how to manage Automated Workflow `proofs`, see [Manage a proof configured with an Automated Workflow in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/automated-workflow/manage-proof-configured-auto-workflow.md).
