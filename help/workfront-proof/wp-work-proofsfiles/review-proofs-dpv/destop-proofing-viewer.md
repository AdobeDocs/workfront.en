# Understand the *Desktop Proofing Viewer*

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *Workfront Proof*. For information on proofing inside *Adobe Workfront*, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

The *Desktop Proofing Viewer* is designed for *proofing* interactive content, but you can also use it to *proof* static and video content.&nbsp;

Unlike the *Web Proofing Viewer*, the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* is an application that runs on your workstation.&nbsp;However, you access it from *Workfront* or from *Workfront Proof* when you launch *proofs*, rather than running it as a standalone application (for more informationabout installing the *Desktop Proofing Viewer*, see [Install the Desktop Proofing Viewer with Automatic Updates](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/use-the-desktop-proofing-viewer/installing-desktop-proofing-viewer.md)).&nbsp;

* [Desktop Proofing Viewer vs. Legacy proofing viewer](#desktop-proofing-viewer-vs-legacy-proofing-viewer)

### *Desktop Proofing Viewer* vs. *Web Proofing Viewer*

Two main characteristics distinguish the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* from the *Web Proofing Viewer*:

<ul> 
 <li>The <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em> lets you review interactive content such as a website, a streaming video, or an interactive banner; the <em>Web Proofing Viewer</em> lets you review only static and video <em>proofs</em>. </li> 
 <li> <p>The <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em> runs on your local computer as an application; the <em>Web Proofing Viewer</em> runs in your browser.</p> <note type="note">  
   <ul> 
    <li> If your organization cannot use the <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em> app for security reasons, your <em>Workfront administrator</em> can configure your system so that you can review interactive content, bundled in a ZIP archive file, in the <em>Web Proofing Viewer</em>.</li> 
    <li>Proof management tasks such as creating and browsing through <em>proofs</em> occur in <em>Workfront</em> or <em>Workfront Proof</em>. The <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em> is only for reviewing <em>proofs</em>.</li> 
   </ul> 
  </note> </li> 
</ul>

For more information about the capabilities of the various *proofing* viewers,&nbsp;see [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md)

### *Desktop Proofing Viewer* vs. Legacy *proofing viewer*

You might not have access to the Legacy *proofing viewer* because it is supported by Flash, which has been deprecated in most environments.

The *Desktop Proofing Viewer* includes the following enhancements over the Legacy *proofing viewer*:

* Review unsecured (HTTP) sites, not just secure (HTTPS) sites.
* Review iFrame-protected sites&nbsp;(sites that cannot be&nbsp;viewed within an iFrame). 
* View content with preconfigured resolutions for various devices.   
  For example, you can see how content displays on various standard desktop resolutions, or on individual devices such as an iPhone 8.

The Legacy *proofing viewer* will be removed from *Workfront* with the 2018.3 release at the end of the 2018 calendar year

The Legacy *proofing viewer* is not included for customers acquiring *Workfront* after the 2018.2 release in July 2018.

## User Setting for Opening Non-Interactive Proofs in the *Desktop Proofing Viewer*

Though the main purpose of the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* is *proofing* interactive content, you can also use it to *proof* static and video *proofs*.

Users can configure the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* to launch automatically when they open *proofs* of all kinds, including static and video *proofs*. For more information, see [Configure proofing viewer settings](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/configure-proofing-viewer-settings.md).

## Entering a Proof URL

If you launch the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* directly from your workstation, you can open a *proof* by specifying the *proof* URL. To do this, you must have *proof* URL of the *proof* you want to view.

We recommend that you open *proofs* directly from *Workfront*. For more information, see [Review a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/review-a-proof.md).
