# Upload Files and Web Content to *Workfront Proof*

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *Workfront Proof*. For information on proofing inside *Adobe Workfront*, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can upload files to *Workfront Proof* without creating a *proof*. You can also add URLs for websites and other web content to *Workfront* Proof.

## About Uploading a File Without Creating a Proof

In some cases, you may want to add a file to *Workfront Proof* and create a *proof* for it simultaneously (see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md)).

In other cases, you may want to add a file to *Workfront Proof* without creating a *proof*.

This is useful, for example, if you do not have *proofing* rights but you need to provide a file for review to users who do have *proofing* rights; one of those users can create the proof after you have uploaded it.

Also, you can use *Workfront Proof* as cloud storage for files without creating *proofs* for them. Some organizations use *Workfront* Proof to keep all digital materials for a project together, even when some of them, such as internal documents about the project, do not need to be proofed.

## Uploading Files and Adding URLs

To upload a file to *Workfront Proof*:

<ol>
