# Copying Proofs in `Workfront Proof`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product `Workfront Proof`. For information on proofing inside `Adobe Workfront`, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Reviewers with edit rights on a `proof` can create a copy of the `proof`, either as a new version of the existing `proof` or as a new `proof`. (For more information, see . For information about edit rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).)

The reviewers that were on the original `proof` automatically appear in the Share section of the Copy `proof` page, but they can be removed. If a reviewer is deleted, their comments will remain.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A copy of a `proof` counts towards your monthly `proof` limit. However, if the copy is created as a new version, it is included in the version set count. For more information, see [Managing Proof Versions in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-versions.md).

* `The `proofing viewer``. For information about the Proofing Viewers, see [Reviewing Proofs in the `Web Proofing Viewer`](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000275214-Reviewing-Proofs-in-the-Web-Proofing-Viewer) (for static `proofs`) and [Reviewing Proofs in the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000686434-Reviewing-Proofs-in-the-Desktop-Proofing-Viewer) (for interactive `proofs`).

* `The Proof details page`. For more information, see [Manage Proof Details in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md).

* `The Folder details page`. For more information, see [Manage Folders and their Contents in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/manage-folders-and-contents.md).

## Copying Existing Proof Settings for a New Proof

Instead of having to pick the reviewers, workflows, tags, and folders over and over again when you create a new `proof`, you can create it using settings for an existing `proof`. If necessary, you can adjust the settings.

To copy existing `proof` settings for a new `proof`:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to any of the <span class="bold">Views</span> pages, as described in <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-items-on-views-page.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof</a>.</li> 
 <li value="2">Open the <span class="bold">More</span> menu for the <span>proof</span>.<br><img src="assets/more-button-small.png"></li> 
 <li value="3">Choose <span class="bold">View <span>proof</span> details</span>&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.</li> 
 <li value="4">Click <span class="bold">More</span>.<br><img src="assets/more-button-text-version.png" alt="More_button_text_version.png"></li> 
 <li value="5">Click <span class="bold">Copy with new file</span> in the dropdown menu.</li> 
 <li value="6">In the <span class="bold">New <span>proof</span></span> page that appears,&nbsp;upload a new file, then click <span class="bold">Create</span>.</li> 
</ol>
