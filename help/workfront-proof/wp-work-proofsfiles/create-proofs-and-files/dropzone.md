* The *`proof`* is accessible by the Dropzone owner (or a user who has at least a Supervisor profile). The owner can be changed within Dropzone settings&nbsp;(only a Billing Administrator or an Administrator can do this).

    * The *`proof`* can be worked on as normal  
    
    *  If the submitter also adds themselves explicitly to the *`proof`*, they will not receive a New *`proof`* email. For more information, see [New proof email](new-proof-email.md).
