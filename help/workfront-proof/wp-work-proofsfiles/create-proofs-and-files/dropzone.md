# The Dropzone

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product `Workfront Proof`. For information on proofing inside `Adobe Workfront`, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

If you have the Enterprise plan, you can use the Dropzone to submit new `proofs` and new versions of `proofs` to your account without having to log in to your account.

When you submit a `proof` via the Dropzone, it appears in the Dropzone page in your `Workfront Proof` account. From there, you can route it into your workflow.&nbsp;

This article explains the following about the Dropzone:

## Submitting a New Proof via the Dropzone URL

1. In your browser, go to the unique Dropzone URL, as described in [Configure the dropzone in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-dropzone-in-wp.md)&nbsp;
1. Enter your email address.
1. Click `Select a file` or `Capture a web page` and choose the file or web page you want to upload.

1. Enter the security code, then click `Next`.  
   A progress bar shows you the progress of your upload.  
   In the next screen, you will be able to add Proof details.  
   Note that this section appears&nbsp;only if it has been enabled in the Dropzone settings.

1. Once you've filled in the details, click `Next`.
1. Any reviewers added to the `proof` will only receive their notification email upon activation of the `proof` (see below).

1. Your `proof` goes through the following states after you submit it to the Dropzone:

  * When you first upload a file to the Dropzone, the `proof` shows there as a Draft.&nbsp;
  * Once you complete the submission, the `proof` shows in your Dropzone as Submitted.
  * Once the `proof` has been activated and unlocked, it shows in your Dropzone as Active.
  * If the `proof` is locked, it shows in your Dropzone as Locked.

 </note> 
</ol>

## Completing Your Submission

`Workfront` sends you (the submitter) a Complete your submission email asking you to confirm whether the file was a new `proof` or a new version. The link in the email notification is valid for 24 hours. `  
`

1. Click the link and follow the steps above, depending on whether it is a new `proof` or a new version of an existing `proof`.

## Activating the Proof

The Dropzone owner receives a notification email to advise that a new `proof` has been submitted to the Dropzone:

* The `proof` appears in the Dropzone page in your account (to access the Dropzone page, click the link in the left navigation sidebar).
* The `proof` is accessible by the Dropzone owner (or a user who has at least a Supervisor profile). The owner can be changed within Dropzone settings&nbsp;(only a Billing Administrator or an Administrator can do this).
* Before the `proof` can be worked on it must be activated/unlocked by the Dropzone owner (a user with at least a Supervisor profile can also do this). The status of the `proof` shows as Submitted until it has been activated/unlocked.

To activate the `proof`:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to the drop down menu to the right of the <span>proof</span> and click <span class="bold">Activate.</span> </li> 
 <p>&nbsp;Once the <span>proof</span> has been activated/unlocked: 
  <ul>
   <li>The <span>proof</span> status changes to Active.</li>
   <li>Any people that were added to the <span>proof</span> will receive a notification email to advise that they have a new <span>proof</span> to review. (No email is sent until the <span>proof</span> has been activated/unlocked.)</li>
   <li>The <span>proof</span> can be worked on as normal<br></li><note type="note">
    &nbsp;If the submitter also adds themselves explicitly to the 
    <span>proof</span>, they will not receive a New 
    <span>proof</span> email. For more information, see 
    <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md" class="MCXref xref">New proof email</a>.
   </note>
  </ul></p> 
</ol>

## Managing Your Dropzone

The Dropzone page makes it easy to manage the submissions to your Dropzone. Your Dropzone page includes the following options and functionality:

* Page layout (1)
* Choose to include/exclude archived `proofs` in the view (2)
* Action buttons (3)
* Sort (4)
* Filter (5)
* Proof actions menu (6)
* Unarchive the `proof` (7)

* Select a `proof` (9)

The page layout and sorting and filtering options are the same as in the Views lists. See [Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-items-on-views-page.md) for more information.
