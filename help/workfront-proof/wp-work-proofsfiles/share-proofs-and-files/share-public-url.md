# Share the Public URL in *`Workfront Proof`* {#share-the-public-url-in-workfront-proof}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *`Workfront Proof`*. For information on proofing inside *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Proofing](_proofing.md).


You can share a *`proof`* by providing the desired recipient with the Public *`proof`*&nbsp;URL.


A Public URL is a URL that opens the *`proof`* but does not log reviewers in automatically. Public URLs can be used when information about a *`proof`* is being sent to a group of people. When they access a *`proof`* from the Public URL, they will view it with read-only access. For information about access levels, see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-roles.md).


An option to sign is also provided, so people who were specifically added to the review will be able to sign in with their email address and make comments and decisions on the *`proof`*.



* You need to manually copy and paste the Public&nbsp;URL into an email and send this to the relevant person.
* The people you give the Public&nbsp;URL to will NOT appear in the Workflow section of the Proof details page.


If subscriptions are enabled on the *`proof`*, anyone who has access to the Proof URL will be able to subscribe themselves to the *`proof`* (so add themselves to the review cycle with the default role specified by the owner of the *`proof`*).


See [Subscribe to a Proof in Workfront Proof](subscribe-to-proof.md) for more information.


To use a *`proof`*'s Public&nbsp;URL:



1. Go to the Proof defails page, as described in [Manage Proof Details in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-details.md).
1. Open the `More sharing options` section.
1. Make sure that the `Proof URL` is enabled.
1. Copy the Public&nbsp;URL to the clipboard.
1. Paste the Public URL into an email or a chat window and send it to your recipient




## Accessing a Proof From a Public URL {#accessing-a-proof-from-a-public-url}

The Public URL does not identify reviewers when the *`proof`* opens. Instead, the *`proof`* opens in read-only&nbsp;mode.


If a person wants to add a comment they need to identify themselves by signing in. If they are already a reviewer on the *`proof`* they will be prompted to enter their login details.


If they are not already a reviewer on the *`proof`*, they will need to subscribe.


>[!NOTE]
>
>Subscriptions can be disabled, in which case they will not be able to subscribe to the *`proof`*.


See [Subscribe to a Proof in Workfront Proof](subscribe-to-proof.md) for more information.


To access the *`proof`* from a Public&nbsp;URL:



* Users open the *`proof`* by using their login details which include their registered email and password for *`Workfront Proof`*.

* Non-users open the *`proof`* by entering an email address and display name.
* In either case, select `Remember me` so that you will have to enter your details this one time (for this *`proof`*).
