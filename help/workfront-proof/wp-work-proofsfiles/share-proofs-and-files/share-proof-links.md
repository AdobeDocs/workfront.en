# Share proof links in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can email the Proof URL and the Download URL for a proof to anyone, whether or not they have a Workfront Proof account. For information about the Proof URL and the Download URL, see [Share the Public URL in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-public-url.md) and [Download Files Stored in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/download-files-stored.md).

People who have not been added to the proof and view it using the Proof URL won't be added to the workflow on the proof and will have Read Only access to the proof. For information about read-only access, see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).

However, the option to sign in will be available. So, if a recipient has already been added to the proof, they can simply enter their details and then they will be able to make comments/decisions&nbsp;(depending on their existing role).

If the Subscription setting&nbsp;is enabled on the proof, any recipient&nbsp;who has not been added to it can subscribe (add) to the proof. See&nbsp; [Subscribe to a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/subscribe-to-proof.md)&nbsp;for more information.

>[!NOTE]

If Public sharing is disabled but the Download the original file is enabled, reviewers will receive&nbsp;only the download link in the email.&nbsp;For more information, see&nbsp; [Download Files Stored in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/download-files-stored.md).
