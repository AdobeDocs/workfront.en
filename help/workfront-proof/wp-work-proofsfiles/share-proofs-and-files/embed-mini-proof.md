# Embed a Mini *`proof`* {#embed-a-mini-proof}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}

>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *`Workfront Proof`*. For information on proofing inside *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Proofing](_proofing.md).


The Mini *`proof`* is a widget that lets you embed a *`proof`* in a web page, blog, or wiki. The Mini *`proof`* shows the *`proof`* and all existing comments and mark-ups. You can use it to work on the *`proof`* as if you were in *`Workfront Proof`*.


Here is an example of a Mini *`proof`* embedded in a Basecamp project: 



* Name of the *`proof`* (1)
* Fullscreen (2) - it will open the *`proof`* in the Proof Viewer (outside of the environment the Mini *`proof`* was embedded in)

* Help links (3)
* Actions menu (4)
* View comments in sidebar (5)
