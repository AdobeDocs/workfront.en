You can adjust the resolution that your content is displayed in for interactive proofs. This enables you to&nbsp;view how content will appear on different&nbsp;devices, such as various sizes of phones, tablets, and monitors.

When users comment on the proof, the current screen resolution is automatically displayed in&nbsp;the comment to ensure other users are aware what resolution the comment is associated with.

You can adjust the resolution of a proof through any of the following ways:

## Specifying&nbsp;a Custom Resolution

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to the Interactive proof for which you want to adjust the screen resolution.</li> 
 <li value="2">In the proofing viewer, next to&nbsp;the <span class="bold">Resolution</span> icon in the lower-right corner of the viewer, specify a custom resolution.<br><img src="assets/phq-resolution-custom.png" alt="phq_resolution_custom.png"><br>The Interactive proof is rendered in the selected resolution.<br>The updated resolution is displayed on each comment made on the proof&nbsp;(this ensures other users are aware what resolution the comment is associated with).<br><img src="assets/phq-resolution-comment.png" alt="phq_resolution_comment.png"></li> 
</ol>
