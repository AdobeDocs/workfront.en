You can adjust the resolution that your content is displayed in for interactive `proofs`. This enables you to&nbsp;view how content will appear on different&nbsp;devices, such as various sizes of phones, tablets, and monitors.


When users comment on the `proof`, the current screen resolution is automatically displayed in&nbsp;the comment to ensure other users are aware what resolution the comment is associated with.
