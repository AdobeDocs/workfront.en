# Legacy `proofing viewer` removed in 2018.3 {#legacy-proofing-viewer-removed-in}

Prior to the 2018.3 release, the Legacy `proofing viewer` was supported. With the 2018.3 release (in November 2018), the Legacy `proofing viewer` and all other applications that rely on Flash have been removed and are no longer available.&nbsp;


For static and video `proofs`, the new `Web Proofing Viewer` is the default viewer. For interactive `proofs`, the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` is the default viewer.


## Removal timeline of the Legacy `proofing viewer` {#removal-timeline-of-the-legacy-proofing-viewer}

The following table illustrates the removal timeline of the Legacy `proofing viewer`:

## Functionality no longer available with the removal of the Legacy `proofing viewer` {#functionality-no-longer-available-with-the-removal-of-the-legacy-proofing-viewer}

In addition to removing the dependency on Flash, the `Web Proofing Viewer` and the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` contain improvements that were not available with the Legacy `proofing viewer`. However, some functionality that was available with the Legacy `proofing viewer` is not available with the new `Web Proofing Viewer` and `Desktop Proofing Viewer`. This functionality includes:



* Interactive `proofing` in the browser  
  With the release of 18.3, interactive `proofing` is supported only in the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`.

* Ability to review SWF files  
  For information about opening `proofs` created previously for SWF files, see [About SWF files](supported-proofing-file-types.md#about-swf-files) in [Supported proofing file types](supported-proofing-file-types.md).

* Desktop Uploader  
  This tool has been deprecated with the 18.3 release.&nbsp;


For a complete feature comparison, see [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer](understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md).
