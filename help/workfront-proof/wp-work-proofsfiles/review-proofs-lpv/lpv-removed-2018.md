Prior to the 2018.3 release, the Legacy *proofing viewer* was supported.&nbsp;With the 2018.3 release (in November 2018), the Legacy *proofing viewer* and all other applications that rely on Flash have been removed and are no longer available.&nbsp;

For static and video *proofs*, the new *Web Proofing Viewer* is the default viewer. For interactive *proofs*, the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* is the default viewer.

## Functionality no longer available with the removal of the Legacy *proofing viewer*

In addition to removing the dependency on Flash, the *Web Proofing Viewer* and the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* contain improvements that were not available with the Legacy *proofing viewer*. However, some functionality that was available with the Legacy *proofing viewer* is not available with the new *Web Proofing Viewer* and *Desktop Proofing Viewer*. This functionality includes:

* Interactive *proofing* in the browser  
  With the release of 18.3, interactive *proofing* is supported only in the *Desktop Proofing Viewer*.

* Ability to review SWF files  
  For information about opening *proofs* created previously for SWF files, see [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md#about-swf-files) in [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md).

* Desktop Uploader  
  This tool has been deprecated with the 18.3 release.&nbsp;

For a complete feature comparison, see [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md).
