# Copying Proofs in `Workfront Proof` {#copying-proofs-in-workfront-proof}

Reviewers with edit rights on a `proof` can create a copy of the `proof`, either as a new version of the existing `proof` or as a new `proof`. (For more information, see [Create a new version of a proof](create-new-version-proof.md). For information about edit rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).)


The reviewers that were on the original `proof` automatically appear in the Share section of the Copy `proof` page, but they can be removed. If a reviewer is deleted, their comments will remain.


>[!NOTE]
>
>A copy of a `proof` counts towards your monthly `proof` limit. However, if the copy is created as a new version, it is included in the version set count. For more information, see [Managing Proof Versions in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-versions.md).

## Copying Existing Proof Settings for a New Proof {#copying-existing-proof-settings-for-a-new-proof}

1. Go to any of the **Views** pages, as described in [Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof](manage-items-on-views-page.md).
