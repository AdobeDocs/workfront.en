# Share `proof` links in `Workfront Proof` {#share-proof-links-in-workfront-proof}

You can email the Proof URL and the Download URL for a `proof` to anyone, whether or not they have a `Workfront Proof` account. For information about the Proof URL and the Download URL, see [Share the Public URL in Workfront Proof](share-public-url.md) and [Download Files Stored in Workfront Proof](download-files-stored.md).


People who have not been added to the `proof` and view it using the Proof URL won't be added to the workflow on the `proof` and will have Read Only access to the `proof`. For information about read-only access, see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-roles.md).


However, the option to sign in will be available. So, if a recipient has already been added to the `proof`, they can simply enter their details and then they will be able to make comments/decisions&nbsp;(depending on their existing role). For information about comments and decisions, see [Create and manage proof comments](create-manage-proof-comments.md) and [Make decisions on a proof](make-decisions-on-proof.md).


If the Subscription setting is enabled on the `proof`, any recipient who has not been added to it can subscribe (add) to the `proof`. See&nbsp; [Subscribe to a Proof in Workfront Proof](subscribe-to-proof.md)&nbsp;for more information.
