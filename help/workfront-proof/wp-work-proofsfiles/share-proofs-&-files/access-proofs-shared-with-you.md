# Access a `proof` shared with you {#access-a-proof-shared-with-you}

When you receive an email about a `proof`, it contains a personal URL to access the `proof`. For more information, see [New proof email](new-proof-email.md).&nbsp;

` `**Warning: **`` The URL from the email is personal to you and will open the `proof` with you already identified as the reviewer. It is important that you do not forward the URL to anyone else; if you do, any comments or decisions that they make will be in your name. If you would like someone else to view the `proof` and you have the `proof` permission to do so, use the `proof` sharing functionality explained in [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](share-proof.md). For information about `proof` permissions, see  [Document permissions](document-permissions.md), or, if you are using `Workfront Proof`, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).


Alternatively, if `proof` sharing is enabled on the `proof`, you can let someone else view the `proof` by sharing the Proof URL from the `proofing viewer` or from the Share this `proof` with someone else link in your New `proof` email).
Consider the following about shared `proofs`:



* Anyone with a valid email address can be added to a `proof`. They do not need to be a `Workfront Proof` user with login credentials.

* Any `proof` that has been shared with you will appear in the Views page of your account. For more information, see [Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof](manage-items-on-views-page.md)

* When someone shares a `proof` URL with you, you can access the `proof` as described in [Share the Public URL in Workfront Proof](share-public-url.md)

* You can search for any `proof` that has been shared with you based on the following criteria: 
    
    
    * `Proof` name
    * Description (message associated with a `proof`)
    * Tag name (see [Create and Manage Tags in Workfront Proof](create-and-manage-tags.md))
    
    



To open a `proof` from an email you have received:



1.  Click **Go to `proof`**&nbsp;in the email.


   The `proof` opens in the `proofing viewer`, ready for review.


   If you need information about the `Workfront` object (such as a project, task, or issue) associated with the `proof`, see [View the Workfront object associated with a proof](view-wf-object-associated-with-proof.md).
