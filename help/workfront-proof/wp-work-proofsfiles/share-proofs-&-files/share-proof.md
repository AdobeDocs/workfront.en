# Share a Proof in `Workfront Proof` {#share-a-proof-in-workfront-proof}

If you have editing rights on a `proof`, you can easily share the `proof` with other reviewers. Anyone can be added to a `proof`, because you don't need to have a `Workfront Proof` account to review `proofs`.


For information about editing rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).


If you share a `proof` by adding reviewers:



* The people you share a `proof` with will appear in the Workflow section of the Proof details page in their accounts. For more information about this page, see&nbsp; [Manage Proof Details in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-details.md).

* You will be able to set their role on the `proof`. For more information, see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-roles.md).

* You will be able to set their email alert. For more information, see&nbsp; [Configure email notification settings in Workfront Proof](config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).




>[!NOTE]

>
>
>* When you add someone to a `proof`, you decide if you would like them to be notified of the `proof` or not. See&nbsp; [New proof email](new-proof-email.md) for more information. 
>
>* You can add anybody to a `proof` (as long as they have a valid email address). They do not need to have a `Workfront Proof` account! 
>
>* Reviewers do not count towards your user limit. You can add as many people to a `proof` as you want for free.

## Adding Reviewers to a New Proof or New Proof Version {#adding-reviewers-to-a-new-proof-or-new-proof-version}

You can add reviewers to a `proof` when you are creating a new `proof` or uploading a new version of a `proof`:



1. Create the `proof` or new version, as described in [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](generate-proofs.md) and [Create a new version of a proof](create-new-version-proof.md).

1. On the **New `proof`** page or **New `proof` version** page, in the **Workflow** section, type the email address of the reviewer you want to add.  
   For information about sharing a `proof` with a group, see&nbsp; [Add Groups to a Proof](add-groups.md).  
   If you shared `proofs` with this person before, their email address appears in the autocomplete dropdown.  
   If you change your mind, you can remove a reviewer from the share list by clicking on the trash icon. You can easily remove all reviewers by clicking on the top trash icon.

1. Finish creating the `proof` or new `proof` version.





## Adding Reviewers to an Existing Proof {#adding-reviewers-to-an-existing-proof}




1. On the Dashboard or any list view, click the **More** button dropdown to the right of the `proof`.
