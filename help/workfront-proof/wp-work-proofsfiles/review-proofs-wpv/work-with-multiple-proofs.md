# Work with multiple *proof*s in the *proofing viewer*

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *Workfront Proof*. For information on proofing inside *Adobe Workfront*, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

In *Workfront Proof*, you can use folders to group *proofs* that you want to work on together or that you want reviewers to work on together. When you or another reviewer opens one of the *proofs*, launching the *proofing viewer*, all of the *proofs* in the folder are also available there. Without leaving the *proofing viewer*, you can view the other *proofs*, sort and search for them, and compare them to each other.

For general information about folders, see [Folders in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/folders.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;A reviewer's ability to open any *proof* in a folder depends on their access to the *proof*.&nbsp;For information about access to *proofs*, see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md).

## Group *proof*s in a folder

<ol> 
 <li value="1">In <em>Workfront Proof</em> (outside the <em>proofing viewer</em>), create a folder, as described in <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/create-folders.md" class="MCXref xref">Create Folders in Workfront Proof</a>.</li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>In the dashboard or a list view, group the <em>proofs</em> you want to work on together by dragging them into the folder you created.</p> <p> <img src="assets/drag-proof-to-folder-350x162.png" alt="Drag_proof_to_folder.png" style="width: 350;height: 162;"> </p> </li> 
</ol>

## Review multiple *proof*s grouped in a folder

As a reviewer, you can work with multiple *proofs* in a folder without leaving the *proofing viewer*.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>In <em>Workfront Proof</em>, click the name of the folder to open it, then open a <em>proof</em> in the folder to launch the <em>proofing viewer</em>.</p> <p>Or</p> <p>Open a <em>proof</em> from a public URL or from an email notification, logging in to the system as required.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click the folder icon in the upper-left corner of your <em>proofing viewer</em>.</p> <p> <img src="assets/folder-icon-in-proofing-viewer.png" alt="Folder_icon_in_proofing_viewer.png"> </p> <p>This opens the folder containing the current <em>proof</em> and the other <em>proofs</em> you added to it.</p> <p> <img src="assets/folder-containing-proofs-in-proofing-viewer-350x164.png" alt="Folder_containing_proofs_in_proofing_viewer.png" style="width: 350;height: 164;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="3">(Optional) Do any of the following with the <em>proofs</em> in the folder while you are using the <em>proofing viewer</em>: 
  <ul>
   <li>To search the folder for the <em>proof</em> you want, click the <span class="bold">Search</span> box in the upper-right corner above the list and start typing part of the name of the <em>proof</em>, then click the <em>proof</em> when it appears.</li>
   <li>To sort the <em>proofs</em> by contents of a column, click <span class="bold">Name</span>, <span class="bold">Created</span>, <span class="bold">Status</span>, or&nbsp;<span class="bold">Owner</span> above the list.&nbsp;</li>
   <li><p>To compare two <em>proofs</em> in the folder, open one <em>proof</em>, then select the other one in the folder list and click the Compare button on the far right of that <em>proof</em> (see <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/compare-proofs.md" class="MCXref xref">Compare proofs in the proofing viewer</a>&nbsp;if you need more information about comparing two <em>proofs</em>).</p><p><img src="assets/compare-button-350x67.png" alt="Compare_button_in_folder_list_in_proofing_viewer.png" style="width: 350;height: 67;"></p><p>While you are comparing <em>proofs</em>, if you want to switch to a new <em>proof</em>, either on the left or right side of the <em>proofing viewer</em>, click the Compare button above the <em>proof</em>.</p><p><img src="assets/mceclip0-350x126.png" style="width: 350;height: 126;"></p></li>
