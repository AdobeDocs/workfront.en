title: Work with multiple proofs in the proofing viewer
description: In Workfront Proof, you can use folders to group proofs that you want to work on together or that you want reviewers to work on together. When you or another reviewer opens one of the proofs, launching the proofing viewer, all of the proofs in the folder are also available there. Without leaving the proofing viewer, you can view the other proofs, sort and search for them, and compare them to each other.

# Work with multiple `proof`s in the `proofing viewer`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product `Workfront Proof`. For information on proofing inside `Adobe Workfront`, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

In `Workfront Proof`, you can use folders to group `proofs` that you want to work on together or that you want reviewers to work on together. When you or another reviewer opens one of the `proofs`, launching the `proofing viewer`, all of the `proofs` in the folder are also available there. Without leaving the `proofing viewer`, you can view the other `proofs`, sort and search for them, and compare them to each other.

For general information about folders, see [Folders in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/folders.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>A reviewer's ability to open any `proof` in a folder depends on their access to the `proof`. For information about access to `proofs`, see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md).

## Group `proof`s in a folder

<ol> 
 <li value="1">In <span>Workfront Proof</span> (outside the <span>proofing viewer</span>), create a folder, as described in <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/create-folders.md" class="MCXref xref">Create Folders in Workfront Proof</a>.</li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>In the dashboard or a list view, group the <span>proofs</span> you want to work on together by dragging them into the folder you created.</p> <p> <img src="assets/drag-proof-to-folder-350x162.png" alt="Drag_proof_to_folder.png" style="width: 350;height: 162;"> </p> </li> 
</ol>

## Review multiple `proof`s grouped in a folder

As a reviewer, you can work with multiple `proofs` in a folder without leaving the `proofing viewer`.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>In <span>Workfront Proof</span>, click the name of the folder to open it, then open a <span>proof</span> in the folder to launch the <span>proofing viewer</span>.</p> <p>Or</p> <p>Open a <span>proof</span> from a public URL or from an email notification, logging in to the system as required.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click the folder icon in the upper-left corner of your <span>proofing viewer</span>.</p> <p> <img src="assets/folder-icon-in-proofing-viewer.png" alt="Folder_icon_in_proofing_viewer.png"> </p> <p>This opens the folder containing the current <span>proof</span> and the other <span>proofs</span> you added to it.</p> <p> <img src="assets/folder-containing-proofs-in-proofing-viewer-350x164.png" alt="Folder_containing_proofs_in_proofing_viewer.png" style="width: 350;height: 164;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="3">(Optional) Do any of the following with the <span>proofs</span> in the folder while you are using the <span>proofing viewer</span>: 
  <ul>
   <li>To search the folder for the <span>proof</span> you want, click the <span class="bold">Search</span> box in the upper-right corner above the list and start typing part of the name of the <span>proof</span>, then click the <span>proof</span> when it appears.</li>
   <li>To sort the <span>proofs</span> by contents of a column, click <span class="bold">Name</span>, <span class="bold">Created</span>, <span class="bold">Status</span>, or&nbsp;<span class="bold">Owner</span> above the list.&nbsp;</li>
   <li><p>To compare two <span>proofs</span> in the folder, open one <span>proof</span>, then select the other one in the folder list and click the Compare button on the far right of that <span>proof</span> (see <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/compare-proofs.md" class="MCXref xref">Compare proofs in the proofing viewer</a>&nbsp;if you need more information about comparing two <span>proofs</span>).</p><p><img src="assets/compare-button-350x67.png" alt="Compare_button_in_folder_list_in_proofing_viewer.png" style="width: 350;height: 67;"></p><p>While you are comparing <span>proofs</span>, if you want to switch to a new <span>proof</span>, either on the left or right side of the <span>proofing viewer</span>, click the Compare button above the <span>proof</span>.</p><p><img src="assets/mceclip0-350x126.png" style="width: 350;height: 126;"></p></li>
