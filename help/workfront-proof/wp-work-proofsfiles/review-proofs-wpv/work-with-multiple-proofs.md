title: Work with multiple proofs in the proofing viewer
description: In Workfront Proof, you can use folders to group proofs that you want to work on together or that you want reviewers to work on together. When you or another reviewer opens one of the proofs, launching the proofing viewer, all of the proofs in the folder are also available there. Without leaving the proofing viewer, you can view the other proofs, sort and search for them, and compare them to each other.

# Work with multiple proofs in the proofing viewer

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

In Workfront Proof, you can use folders to group proofs that you want to work on together or that you want reviewers to work on together. When you or another reviewer opens one of the proofs, launching the proofing viewer, all of the proofs in the folder are also available there. Without leaving the proofing viewer, you can view the other proofs, sort and search for them, and compare them to each other.

For general information about folders, see [Folders in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/folders.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;A reviewer's ability to open any proof in a folder depends on their access to the proof.&nbsp;For information about access to proofs, see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md).

## Group proofs in a folder

<ol> 
 <li value="1">In Workfront Proof (outside the proofing viewer), create a folder, as described in <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/create-folders.md" class="MCXref xref">Create Folders in Workfront Proof</a>.</li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>In the dashboard or a list view, group the proofs you want to work on together by dragging them into the folder you created.</p> <p> <img src="assets/drag-proof-to-folder-350x162.png" alt="Drag_proof_to_folder.png" style="width: 350;height: 162;"> </p> </li> 
</ol>

## Review multiple proofs grouped in a folder

As a reviewer, you can work with multiple proofs in a folder without leaving the proofing viewer.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>In Workfront Proof, click the name of the folder to open it, then open a proof in the folder to launch the proofing viewer.</p> <p>Or</p> <p>Open a proof from a public URL or from an email notification, logging in to the system as required.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click the folder icon in the upper-left corner of your proofing viewer.</p> <p> <img src="assets/folder-icon-in-proofing-viewer.png" alt="Folder_icon_in_proofing_viewer.png"> </p> <p>This opens the folder containing the current proof and the other proofs you added to it.</p> <p> <img src="assets/folder-containing-proofs-in-proofing-viewer-350x164.png" alt="Folder_containing_proofs_in_proofing_viewer.png" style="width: 350;height: 164;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="3">(Optional) Do any of the following with the proofs in the folder while you are using the proofing viewer: 
  <ul>
   <li>To search the folder for the proof you want, click the <span class="bold">Search</span> box in the upper-right corner above the list and start typing part of the name of the proof, then click the proof when it appears.</li>
   <li>To sort the proofs by contents of a column, click <span class="bold">Name</span>, <span class="bold">Created</span>, <span class="bold">Status</span>, or&nbsp;<span class="bold">Owner</span> above the list.&nbsp;</li>
   <li><p>To compare two proofs in the folder, open one proof, then select the other one in the folder list and click the Compare button on the far right of that proof (see <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/compare-proofs.md" class="MCXref xref">Compare proofs in the proofing viewer</a>&nbsp;if you need more information about comparing two proofs).</p><p><img src="assets/compare-button-350x67.png" alt="Compare_button_in_folder_list_in_proofing_viewer.png" style="width: 350;height: 67;"></p><p>While you are comparing proofs, if you want to switch to a new proof, either on the left or right side of the proofing viewer, click the Compare button above the proof.</p><p><img src="assets/mceclip0-350x126.png" style="width: 350;height: 126;"></p></li>
  </ul></li> 
</ol>
