 <li value="3"> <p>In the list that appears, click the version you want to view.</p> </li> 
 <li value="4">(Optional) To unlock the version if you want users to be able to add comments or change a decision, if you have rights to do so, click the <span class="bold">Unlock</span> icon in the left panel, then click <span class="bold">Yes, unlock</span>. </li> 
</ol>
