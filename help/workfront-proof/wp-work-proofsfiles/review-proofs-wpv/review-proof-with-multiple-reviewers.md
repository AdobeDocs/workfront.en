>[!IMPORTANT]

>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *Workfront Proof*. For information on proofing inside *Adobe Workfront*, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Multiple reviewers can review a *proof* at the same time.&nbsp;When you are reviewing a *proof*, you can see who else is currently reviewing the same *proof*.&nbsp;

You can see presence indicators when other reviewers have the same *proof* open, whether or not they add comments to the *proof*. If they do add comments, the comments appear while you are reviewing the *proof*; you don't have to refresh the *proofing viewer* to see them.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>View the presence indicators in the upper-right corner of the <em>proofing viewer</em>.</p> <p>If you are using <em>Workfront Proof</em> (not the proofing functionality integrated with <em>Workfront</em>_, presence indicators contain the user's <em>Workfront Proof</em> profile picture or, if there is no profile picture, the first and last initial if the user. </p> <p>Profile pictures in <em>Workfront</em> do not appear in the <em>proofing viewer</em>.<br></p> </li>
