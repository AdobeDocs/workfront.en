# Review a *`proof`* simultaneously with multiple reviewers {#review-a-proof-simultaneously-with-multiple-reviewers}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *`Workfront Proof`*. For information on proofing inside *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Proofing](_proofing.md).


Multiple reviewers can review a *`proof`* at the same time. When you are reviewing a *`proof`*, you can see who else is currently reviewing the same *`proof`*.&nbsp;


You can see presence indicators when other reviewers have the same *`proof`* open, whether or not they add comments to the *`proof`*. If they do add comments, the comments appear while you are reviewing the *`proof`*; you don't have to refresh the *`proofing viewer`* to see them.



1.  View the presence indicators in the upper-right corner of the *`proofing viewer`*.


   If you are using *`Workfront Proof`* (not the proofing functionality integrated with *`Workfront`*_, presence indicators contain the user's *`Workfront Proof`* profile picture or, if there is no profile picture, the first and last initial if the user. 


   Profile pictures in *`Workfront`* do not appear in the *`proofing viewer`*.  


1.  (Optional) Mouse over a presence indicator to view the name of the user.
