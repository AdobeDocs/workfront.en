A Proof Made email includes your personal message (if you include one) and the following proof details:

* Proof name
* Personal link to the proof
* Version number
* Thumbnail of the proof
* Proof Progress
* A link to Share the proof with someone else
* This allows you to share the proof URL and/or the download link for the original file.

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;Sharing proof links does not allow you to explicitly add reviewers to the proof, you will only be sharing the public proof URL, and the recipient will receive Read only access to the proof.

See [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md) for more information.

If you don't want this link to appear on your recipient's email, you should disable the Public sharing settings on the proof (Download original file and Public URL).
