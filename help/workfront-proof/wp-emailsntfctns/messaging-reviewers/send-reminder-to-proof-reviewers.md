During the review and approval process, you can send a message to one or all of the reviewers on a *`proof`* to remind them to complete their review or to provide other information about the *`proof`*. You can send the default reminder email or add your own customized message.


The default reminder email includes the following information:



* Personal link to the *`proof`*
* Thumbnail of the *`proof`* image
* The following *`proof`* details:
*  `<li>Proof name</li>` `<li>Version number</li>` `<li>Folder name (if applicable)</li>` `<li>List of the reviewers and their progress on the <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.proof-sing-n variable varname">proof</span></li>` 



You can also remind somebody about multiple *`proofs`* that have been shared with them. For more information, see [Remind a reviewer about assignments in Workfront Proof](remind-reviewer-assignments-wp.md).
