>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *Workfront Proof*. For information on proofing inside *Adobe Workfront*, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [*Workfront* Plans.](https://www.workfront.com/plans)

You can create groups of users that you can add as reviewers on multiple *proofs*. This is useful if you send content to the same users regularly.

1. On the Dashboard, click the down arrow next to `New,` then click `New group`.

1. In the `New group` box that appears, enter details for the Group (Group names can be up to 128 characters).

   Selecting `Private` makes the Group visible only to you and the other members of the Group.

1. In the `People` section, add or remove people from your Group, specifying their role and email alert options as necessary.

   If you need information about specifying roles, see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).

   If you need information about email alert options, see [Configure email notification settings in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).

1. Click `Save`.
