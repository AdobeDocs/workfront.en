# Add a Guest to *Workfront Proof*

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *Workfront Proof*. For information on proofing inside *Adobe Workfront*, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Contacts are shared in an organization by default. So if you add a Guest, your Colleagues will see that person in their contacts list as well. For information about Guests and Collegues, see [Understand Users, Members, and Guests in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/contacts/use-members-guests.md).

Anyone you add to a *proof* will automatically be added to your contacts list. For information about adding reviewers to a *proof*, see [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Guests don't count towards your user limit - they appear only as entries on your Contacts page, for easier *proofs* sharing. Guests don't have *Workfront Proof* credentials, so you won't be able to share Login required *proofs* with them

To add a new Guest:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">On the Dashboard, click the down arrow next to&nbsp;<span class="bold">New <em>proof</em></span>, then click&nbsp;<span class="bold">New guest</span>.</li> <note type="note">
  If you have an Observer profile, you will not have the option to add new contacts. For more information, see 
  <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof</a>.
 </note> 
 <li value="2">Type the guest's information, then click <span class="bold">Create.<br></span>You can choose the default <em>proof</em> role and permissions&nbsp;for the new Guest. When this person is then added to a <em>proof</em> they will be given this role and alert by default, however these can be changed on the New <em>proof</em> page when adding them to the <em>proof</em>. <br>For more information, see <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof</a> and <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Configure email notification settings in Workfront Proof</a>.</li>
