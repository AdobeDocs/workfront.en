# Add a Guest to *`Workfront Proof`* {#add-a-guest-to-workfront-proof}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *`Workfront Proof`*. For information on proofing inside *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Proofing](_proofing.md).


Contacts are shared in an organization by default. So if you add a Guest, your Colleagues will see that person in their contacts list as well. For information about Guests and Collegues, see [Understand Users, Members, and Guests in Workfront Proof](use-members-guests.md).


Anyone you add to a *`proof`* will automatically be added to your contacts list. For information about adding reviewers to a *`proof`*, see [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](share-proof.md).


>[!NOTE]
>
>Guests don't count towards your user limit - they appear only as entries on your Contacts page, for easier *`proofs`* sharing. Guests don't have *`Workfront Proof`* credentials, so you won't be able to share Login required *`proofs`* with them


To add a new Guest:



1. On the Dashboard, click the down arrow next to  `New *`proof`*`, then click  `New guest`.

1. If you have an Observer profile, you will not have the option to add new contacts. For more information, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).
1. Type the guest's information, then click `Create.  
   `You can choose the default *`proof`* role and permissions for the new Guest. When this person is then added to a *`proof`* they will be given this role and alert by default, however these can be changed on the New *`proof`* page when adding them to the *`proof`*.   
   For more information, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md) and [Configure email notification settings in Workfront Proof](config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).
