# Understand Users, Members, and Guests in *`Workfront Proof`* {#understand-users-members-and-guests-in-workfront-proof}

Users, Members, and Guests are the three types of contacts you can work with on the Contacts page.


See&nbsp; [Manage Your Contacts in Workfront Proof](manage-contacts.md) for more information about the Contacts page.



*  `Users` 


  Users have a *`Workfront Proof`* login in your organization's account. If you are a *`Workfront Proof administrator`*, you can add a new user. See [Create Users using Workfront Proof](create-users.md) for more information.

*  `Members`   



  Members have their own *`Workfront Proof`* login in another organization's account (not your own). You cannot convert members to users in your account.

*  `Guests`   



  Guests do not have their own *`Workfront Proof`* login in your organization's account, but you have added their details to your account (for example, guest reviewers on *`proofs`*). You can convert guests to users. For more information, see [Create Users using Workfront Proof](create-users.md).
