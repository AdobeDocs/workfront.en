Billing Administrators and Administrators can create and manage custom profiles to specify what users can do in your organization's account and in Account settings.&nbsp;

This feature is available only on&nbsp;Premium accounts.<![CDATA[        ]]>

## Module Permissions

Module permissions let you decide what access you want your users to have over their own items and over items owned by other users in the account.

Basic access&nbsp;section determines if users can Read, Create, Edit, and Delete their own items in the account.

Both sections allow you to grant rights over the following items in the account:
