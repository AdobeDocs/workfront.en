# Create Users using `Workfront Proof`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product `Workfront Proof`. For information on proofing inside `Adobe Workfront`, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

As a `Workfront Proof administrator`, you can create new users.

For information about administrator rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).

>We do not recommend adding third parties to your own account.

You can create a user from scratch or you can convert a Guest to a licensed user.&nbsp;

## Creating a User

1. Do any of the following to begin creating a user:

  * Click the drop-down menu arrow next to  `New `proof``, then click  `New user`.
  
  * Click `Settings` > `Account Settings`, then click `+New User`.
  
  * Click  `Contacts`in the left navigation menu, click `+`  `New`, then click  `New user`.* 
    *The New User dialog box displays.

1. In the `New User` box that appears, type the person's information and set configuration options as described in&nbsp; [Configure User Information using Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/users/configure-user-info.md).

1. Click  `Create.`

## Converting a Guest to a User

Guests are users who do not have a licensed `Workfront Proof` account. If a Guest upgrades to a licensed user account, you need to manually convert a Guest account into a licensed user.&nbsp;

For more information on Guests and users, see [Understand Users, Members, and Guests in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/contacts/use-members-guests.md).&nbsp;
