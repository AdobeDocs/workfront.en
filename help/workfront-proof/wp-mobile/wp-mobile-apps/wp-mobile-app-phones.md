# *Workfront Proof* mobile app

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *Workfront Proof*. For information on proofing inside *Adobe Workfront*, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Download the *Workfront Proof*&nbsp;app from the Apple App Store or Google Store to be productive wherever you are. The *Workfront* Proof app has the following features on the iPhone and iPod Touch:

* View, review, and approve both static and audio-visual *proofs*
* View, add, and reply to comments
* Manage your *proofs* via your dashboard and views

You do not need to be a user of *Workfront Proof* (i.e., have your own login credentials) to review and approve a *proof* via the iOS app. As long as you download the app to your iOS device and access your personal URL via your iOS email app, then you can review and approve on the go.

## Device requirements

Requires iOS 7.0 or later. Android 4.0 and up. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.

## Download and install the app

Download our *Workfront Proof* Mobile App directly from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workfront-proof/id1030372728?mt=8) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.proofhq.tabletapp).

For iOS devices, make sure to uninstall the previous *Workfront Proof* app for iOS devices before installing the new app.

The *Workfront Proof* app automatically detects what type of device you are using. If you&nbsp;would like to use the app on your tablet, see&nbsp; [Workfront Proof mobile app for tablets](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mobile/wp-mobile-apps/wp-mobile-app-tablet.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;It is not possible to review SWF files or Audio files, such as MP3 on iOS devices, due to the software limitations of mobile devices. If you would like to review a *proof* created from a SWF file or an Audio file on a mobile device, please convert it to a supported&nbsp;format before uploading to&nbsp;*Workfront Proof*.

## Getting started with the app

You do not have to be a *Workfront Proof* user to start using the app. Simply install the app on your device and click a `Go To Proof` link in your email notification. The app automatically starts and loads the *proof*.

If you are a *Workfront Proof* user you can log in to the app before opening any *proofs*. The app allows you to browse all the *proofs* shared with you and to easily switch between them.

1. Open the app.
1. Enter your email and password and tap  `Login`.

   Or `  
   `

   Use Single Sign-On, if it's configured on your *Workfront Proof* account.

   You can use the  `Forgot password` option if you don't remember your&nbsp;password.

## The Dashboard

After you log into your *Workfront Proof* account, the Dashboard appears. Here you can easily access your *proofs*. You can open one of the available views, My *proofs*, and All *proofs*. Alternatively you can tap the name of one of your recent *proofs* to go directly to the *proofing viewer*.

By default, the Dashboard will open the Total *proofs* view. This view shows all the *proofs* that you are the owner of or that were shared with you. You can change the view by tapping&nbsp;the bar at the top of the page to open a drop-down menu containing the On time, At risk, Late and Recent options. To open a *proof* from any view, scroll down the list to find the *proof* you want, then tap its name to go to the *proofing viewer*.

| `On Time View`  |Shows you all active *proofs* in your account that you have permission to see and that have no deadline or there is more than 24 hours until the deadline. |
|---|---|
| `At Risk View`  |Displays all&nbsp;*proofs* for which the deadline is less than 24 hours. |
| `Late View`  |Lists all&nbsp;*proofs* in which not all actions are completed&nbsp;for which the deadline is already breached. |
| `Recent view`  |Includes the *proofs*&nbsp;that have been recently accessed by you&nbsp;and that&nbsp;you own, have permissions to see as per your profile permissions and that were shared with you.&nbsp;This view shows&nbsp;only the *proofs*&nbsp;that you yourself have opened (either via&nbsp;the *Workfront Proof* Viewer or via the Proof details page). |
| `Email link`  |To open a *proof* from your email, simply open the email in your email app, click on the Go to *proof* button link in the email (1) and you will be taken to the *proof* in the *Workfront Proof* app. |
