## Creating a New Version of a Proof Via a File in Box

It's easy to create a new version&nbsp;of a *proof* using a new version of the file from your Box account. See for more information.

1. Follow the steps above.
1. While on the New *proof* page, click on the New version link (1) to go to the New version page where you will be able to complete the process of creating a new version of an existing *proof*.  
   If you have already created a *proof* via Box using a previous version of the file, the notification on the top of the page will reflect this

1. In the `Existing *proof*` pop-up, select the parent version of your new *proof*. If the previous version of the *proof* was also submitted from Box, this *proof* will appear in the Matching *proofs* section on the top of the list. You can also select your parent version from the Other *proofs* section.&nbsp;

1. If you can't see the *proof* you'd like to choose in the list, you can:

  * Sort the columns by clicking on the column header.
  * Filter by name - type in the name of the previous *proof* and apply the filter by clicking the filter icon - only available if you have more than one page of items on the list.
  * Identify your other Box submissions by the Box logo.

1. Click `Save` to go to&nbsp;the New version page where you will be able to do any of the following:

  * Change the parent version by clicking `Change *proof*`.
  * Cancel creating a new version by clicking a trash icon. Proceed with submitting your file as a new *proof*.

1. Populate the `New version` page as normal (as if you'd uploaded the file directly from within *Workfront Proof*), then click `Save` to go&nbsp;to the Proof details page.  
   Here you can access the new version by clicking `Go to *proof*`.
