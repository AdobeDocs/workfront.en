If you are using the `Workfront Proof` - Box integration, in Box, you can view the original file used to create a `proof`. You can do this in two ways:

## Viewing the File in Box via Proof Email Notification

When a new `proof` or a new version is created from a Box file, the creator and reviewers receive an email notification that contains a link to the file in your Box account (1).

## Viewing the File in Box via the Proof Details Page
