Basecamp is an online project management tool developed by 37signals. If you use Basecamp for project management you can offer your project team richer review and approval tools using `Workfront Proof`.

## Understanding Proof Reviews in Basecamp Classic

When integrated with `Workfront Proof`, Basecamp allows users to do the following with `proofs`:

<ul> 
 <li>Users can review and approve <span>proofs</span> within Basecamp Classic.</li> 
 <li>Users have review tools readily available.</li> 
 <li>Project review teams receive a message in Basecamp with a mini <span>proof</span> for review and approval.</li> 
 <li>Users can switch to a full-page <span>proof</span> for review and approval.</li> 
 <li>Users can add comments and markups to both mini- and full-sized <span>proofs</span>.<br></li> <note type="note">
   Once a comment has been replied to, it cannot be edited/deleted. For information about comments, see 
  <a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/comment-on-proof.md" class="MCXref xref">Comment on a proof</a>.
 </note> 
 <li>Reviewers can respond to the and markups made by other reviewers. For information about comments, see <a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/comment-on-proof.md" class="MCXref xref">Comment on a proof</a>.</li> 
 <li>Users are alerted when a new version of <span>proof</span> is available.</li> 
 <li>Users who are not <span>Workfront Proof</span> users can work on a <span>proof</span> in Basecamp.</li> 
</ul>

## Viewing a Proof via the Notification Email

If you link a `proof` to Basecamp, `Workfront Proof` sends a `proof` notification email (1) to all reviewers, containing the following information:

* `Proof details` (2): Displays information about the `proof`. The information that displays depends on how your `Workfront administrator` has configured Basecamp.

* `Go to Proof link` (3): Opens the `proof` in `Workfront`.&nbsp;

* `Basecamp URL` (4): Opens the `proof` in Basecamp. If non-Basecamp reviewers are added to the `proof`, their email notification does not include the Basecamp link.

* `Proof progress` (5): Lists the stages of approval and displays the Proof progress indicators.
* `Stage` (6): Lists the reviewers and their individual progress.

## Reviewing a Proof in Basecamp

The mini `proof` in Basecamp provides you with the tools you need to add and to make [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md) on the `proof`. All users assigned to the project see your markups and comments and can respond with their own comments in a real time.

When you open the `proof`, the `proof` displays in the `proofing` window (1) and the name of the proof and version number displays in the upper-left corner (2).

To review the `proof`:

1. To add a comment, click Comment (3) at the top of the `proof`, and type your comment.  
   There is no need to send a response to the Basecamp message, as the comments and [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md) saved to the `proof` (similar to reviewing a `proof` within `Workfront Proof`).

1. To add a decision, click Decision (3) at the top of the `proof`, and select your approval decision.

Other features on the `proof` window include:

* `Action menus` (4): Allows you to select settings for the `proof`.

* `Full-screen button` (5): Allows you to toggle between full-screen and mini- `proof`.

* `Sidebar` (6): Allows you to expand or shrink view of `proof`.

* `Username` (7): Displays your username if you are logged into `Workfront`.

* `Zoom tools` (8): Allows you to magnify an area of the `proof`.

* `Page navigation tools` (9): Allows you to scroll to other pages within the `proof`.
