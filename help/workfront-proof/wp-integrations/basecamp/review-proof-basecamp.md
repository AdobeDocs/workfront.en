# Review a Proof in Basecamp {#review-a-proof-in-basecamp}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product *`Workfront Proof`*. For information on proofing inside *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Proofing](_proofing.md).


The Basecamp integration with *`Workfront Proof`* makes it easy for you to review and approve *`proofs`* without leaving Basecamp.


You don't even need a *`Workfront Proof`* login to use all of the review tools to make comments and decisions on *`proofs`*:



* In your Basecamp account, you'll receive a message which includes the *`proof`* for you to review (via the mini *`proof`*)

* You can add comments, markups and make decisions on the mini *`proof`* or switch to the full-page *`proof`* for review if you prefer

* You can see and respond to the comments and markups of the other reviewers


For information about the reviewing *`proofs`* see [Review proofs in the Web Proofing Viewer](_review-proofs-in-wpv.md) (for static *`proofs`*) or  [Review an interactive proof](review-and-managing-interactive-proofs.md) (for interactive *`proofs`*).


For information about decisions, see [Make decisions on a proof](make-decisions-on-proof.md).


>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are not a user of *`Workfront Proof`*, you can still work on the *`proof`* in Basecamp. All you need to do is enter your email address and screen name. You can also choose to "remember me" so you only need to enter these details once.




## Viewing the Proof via the Notification Email {#viewing-the-proof-via-the-notification-email}

If you link a new or existing *`proof`* to Basecamp, *`Workfront Proof`* will send a *`proof`* notification email to all reviewers containing:



* The *`proof`* message (custom or standard) (1)
* Proof details (2)
* Personal URL (Go to Proof link) (3)
* Link to the Basecamp project message to take you straight to the *`proof`* in Basecamp (4)  
  If non-Basecamp reviewers have been added to the *`proof`*, their email notification will not include the Basecamp link.

* Proof progress (5)
* Reviewers and their individual progress (6)




>[!NOTE]

>&nbsp;If you do not have a Basecamp session open in another browser window, you must sign in to your Basecamp account before you can see the message in Basecamp.

## Viewing the Proof via the Basecamp Message {#viewing-the-proof-via-the-basecamp-message}

When you receive an email notification about a new *`proof`* added to your Basecamp project:



1.  `<li value="1">Go to your project page (1).</li>` `<li value="2">Find the message for your <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.proof-sing-n variable varname">proof</span> (2).<br>The message page contains the name of the <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.proof-sing-n variable varname">proof</span> (in the subject) (3) and a&nbsp;link to the full screen Proof Viewer (4).</li>`  ![Basecamp_messages_1.png](assets/basecamp-messages-1-350x129.png)




   If you are logged in to your *`Workfront Proof`* account in one of your browsers windows, you can start reviewing right away. If you cannot see your name in bottom left corner of mini *`proof`*:
   `<li value="3">Click <span class="bold">Sign In</span> (5).</li>` `<li value="4">Type your email address (which was used to add you to the <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.proof-sing-n variable varname">proof</span>) (6).</li>` `<li value="5">Click <span class="bold">Next</span> and in a second box that appears, type your <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.ProdNameWFP variable varname">Workfront Proof</span> password (7).<br>If you don't have a <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.ProdNameWFP variable varname">Workfront Proof</span> account, type a public name to display.</li>` `<li value="6">Click <span class="bold">Remember me</span> so you only have to input your details once.<br>Now you're ready to proceed with reviewing the <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.proof-sing-n variable varname">proof</span> in Basecamp.</li>` 





## Reviewing a Proof in Basecamp {#reviewing-a-proof-in-basecamp}

Reviewing a *`proof`* in Basecamp is as easy as doing so in *`Workfront Proof`*. The mini *`proof`* in Basecamp provides you with all the tools you need to add comments, mark-ups and make decisions on the *`proof`*.


For information about these review activites, see [Create and manage proof comments](create-manage-proof-comments.md) and&nbsp; [Make decisions on a proof](make-decisions-on-proof.md).


![Basecamp_message_window_with_miniproof.png](assets/basecamp-message-window-with-miniproof-350x406.png)





* Your Basecamp project name (1)
* The *`Workfront Proof`* email notification subject (2)
* Direct link to the full Proof Viewer (opens a full window view) (3)
* Proof name and version (4)
* Action menus (5)
* Full-screen button (6)
* Sidebar (7)
* User name (8)
* Comment and Decision buttons (9)
* Zoom tools (10)
* Page navigation tools (11)


There is no need to send a response to the Basecamp message, as the comments and decisions will be saved on the *`proof`* (as they are when reviewing a *`proof`* within *`Workfront Proof`*).


## Reviewing the Full-Page Proof&nbsp; {#reviewing-the-full-page-proof}

You can display the full-page *`proof`* with all of the *`Workfront Proof`* normal functionality by clicking either the link in the message just above the mini *`proof`* or the fullscreen icon in the top right corner of the mini *`proof`*.


The *`proof`* image is still the original size, but the page itself is wider than the mini *`proof`* page.


The full-page *`proof`* shows:



* The Add comments and Submit decision buttons (rather than the comments and decision icons shown on the mini *`proof`*) (1).
* More zooming and navigation tools than the mini *`proof`* (2).
* The Go to Basecamp button in the top left corner of the *`proof`*. Clicking this will take you back into your Basecamp account (3).
