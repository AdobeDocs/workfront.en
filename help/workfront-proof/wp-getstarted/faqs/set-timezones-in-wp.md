# Setting time zones in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Workfront Proof displays the time when a proof was created and when any activity has taken place on the proof, such as deadlines, decisions, and comments. By default the time is displayed in GMT.

As a user with your own Workfront Proof account, you can set your time zone in personal settings. All times in Workfront will be shown in this time zone, even for a proof that was created by a user in a different time zone. For more information, see [Personal Settings.](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000921168-Personal-settings)

All guest reviewers (users without their own Workfront Proof account) will see all times in the timezone of the proof owner. For more information, see [Understand Users, Members, and Guests in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/contacts/use-members-guests.md).
