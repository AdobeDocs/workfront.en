Clearing your browser's cookies and cache can improve performance in *Workfront Proof*.

* `Browser cookies` are small pieces of text information that a web server&nbsp;or&nbsp;application stores in your web browser to remember your selected settings, configurations, visited pages, searches, and&nbsp;online&nbsp;sessions.  
  Clearing cookies in your browser can resolve various problems with signing in or with staying logged into *Workfront Proof*. It can also eliminate problems with permissions. Most browsers automatically remove older or expired cookies, but you can do it manually any time. See your browser's online Help if you need instructions. If you need help from *Workfront*, contact our Support team at https://support.workfront.com.

* `The browser cache` stores downloaded parts of&nbsp;web pages and applications such as images, scripts, CSS files. This speeds up your browser because it doesn't need to retrieve pages of data every time you visit a particular site; it simply loads the data from your computer.  
  Your browser updates the cache periodically, but not constantly, so you may not always see the most recent version of a&nbsp;web page you are working with.&nbsp;Sometimes, as you change information on a website, its pages may freeze, some elements may not display properly, and some functions may not work.  
  *Workfront* releases new features and critical fixes every other week, so we recommend clearing your browser's cache regularly to ensure that all the data is compatible and up to date. See your browser's online Help if you need instructions. If you need help from *Workfront*, contact our Support team at https://support.workfront.com.
