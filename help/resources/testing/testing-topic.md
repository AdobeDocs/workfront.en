# How access levels work

As an *Adobe Workfront administrator*, you can grant users access to view or edit objects by assigning them an access level. The articles below explain how access levels work.

# Customize Home and Summary using a layout template in *the new Adobe Workfront experience*

You can use a Layout Template to configure the fields and global settings that users see when they click a task or issue. Each configuration you make using the steps below affects the Home area and the Summary panel in the same way.

For example, you could do the following to customize what users see in Home and Summary when they select a task:

<ul> 
 <li> <p>Add a custom field, hide a default field, and reorder the fields that display in the Details area</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <p>In Home:</p> <p> <img src="assets/home-details-350x187.jpg" style="width: 350;height: 187;"> </p> </li> 
   <li> <p>And in Summary:</p> <p> <img src="assets/summary-details-350x219.jpg" style="width: 350;height: 219;"> </p> </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li>Show or hide the Documents section</li> 
</ul>

You can also customize the fields that users see in the Home area when they click a project approval, document approval, or document version approval that is assigned to them.

For information about the Home area, see [Use the Home area](../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-the-home-area.md). For information about the Summary panel, see [Summary overview in the new Adobe Workfront experience](../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/summary-overview.md).
