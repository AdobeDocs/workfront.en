You can leverage agile functionality for your project (such as story boards and burndown charts)&nbsp;without the administrative challenges&nbsp;that typically accompany agile practices (such as managing a team backlog, creating iterations, and so forth). For more information, see [Manage a project in the Agile View](manage-projects-in-agile-view.md).
