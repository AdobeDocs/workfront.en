# Update the status of stories and subtasks on the Scrum board

You can change the status of a story directly from the agile story board to reflect how the stories are progressing through the iteration or project.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only statuses selected in the Story Board section in the team settings area are available on the Scrum board and in the status drop-down menu. For more information, see [Configure Scrum](../../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-scrum.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>
