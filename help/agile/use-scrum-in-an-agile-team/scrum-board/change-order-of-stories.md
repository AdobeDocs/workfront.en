description: The order in which stories appear on the story board does not indicate priority. However, it can affect the perceived priority by making stories more visible.

# Change the order of stories on the Scrum board

The order in which stories appear on the story board does not indicate priority. However, it can affect the perceived priority by making stories more visible. By default, stories are displayed in alphabetical order within each status column on the story board. (Stories&nbsp;with swimlanes are displayed at the top of the story board, and stories without swimlanes are displayed separately below any swimlanes.)

When you reorder columns on the story board, any changes you make are saved on the iteration or project, so changes are retained the next time you or another user views the story board. (Changes you make are not reverted&nbsp;when clearing the browser cache.)

## Access requirements

## Change story order in a project

Unlike agile iterations, you cannot change story order when viewing a project in an agile view. To modify story order for a project, you must view the project in a standard view.

For information about how to change the project view, see [Manage a project in the Agile View](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/manage-projects-in-agile-view.md). Instead of selecting an agile view, select a standard view.
