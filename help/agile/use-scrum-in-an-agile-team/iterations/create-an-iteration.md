# Create an iteration

Iterations are a key component for Scrum agile teams in planning out work capacity. *Adobe Workfront* allows Scrum agile teams to manage their work by creating multiple&nbsp;iterations to accommodate team needs.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Review</em> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.

</ol>

## Understand how task start dates are calculated when added to an iteration

When you add a task as a story to an iteration, the Must Finish On task constraint is used for&nbsp;each story. In most cases, the planned start date of the task is calculated based on the following formula:

Iteration End Date minus (-) Task Duration equals (=) Task Planned Start Date

The Project End Date is used instead of the Iteration End Date if&nbsp;the&nbsp;project start date is after the iteration start date, and the project end date is after the iteration end date.

<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">You can configure individual Scrum teams to use the project dates by default, rather than the iteration dates.
