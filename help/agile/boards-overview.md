# Boards overview

Adobe Workfront Boards are flexible tools that allow team collaboration by providing access to a shared board that contains columns and cards.

Showing task status is a common use for boards, but you can group any items together. A card on a board can represent a person, group of people, idea, concept, or any type of item that you need.

Using boards, you can:

* Quickly set up a task board
* Configure columns to show a status or category
* Customize workflows with open ended cards
* Organize and manage work for a team in one place

>[!NOTE]
>
>Boards is currently a standalone tool. The cards that you add to a board are not connected to work items or objects in Workfront.

For information about how to use boards, see [Get started with boards in Adobe Workfront](../agile/get-started-with-boards/get-started-with-boards.md).
