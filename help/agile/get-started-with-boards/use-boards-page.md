# Use the boards dashboard

The boards dashboard shows the list of boards that you have access to, including boards you have created and boards that you have been added to.

On the boards dashboard you can archive a board, filter the list of boards, and delete a board. For information about creating a new board or editing an existing board, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Archive a board

Archiving a board sends it to the archive and you can restore it later.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you archive a board, it is archived for all of the board members.

1. Click the `Main Menu` icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click `Boards`.
1. Click the `More` menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board, and select `Archive`.

   An Archive icon ![Archive](assets/archive-icon-spectrum-25x20.png) appears on the board. You can't edit an archived board.

   Archived boards remain on the boards dashboard unless you apply a filter to not display them. For more information, see the [Filter boards](#filter) section in this article.

1. To restore an archived board, click the `More` menu ![More menu icon](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board and select `Restore`.

## Filter boards

You can filter the list of boards to show active boards, archived boards, or all boards.

1. Click the `Main Menu` icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click `Boards`.
1. Click the filter icon ![Filter](assets/filter-icon-spectrum-25x25.png) and select `All`, `Active boards`, or `Archived boards`.

## Delete a board

When you delete a board, it is permanently removed from Workfront and canâ€™t be restored. Any cards on the board are also deleted along with the board.

>[!NOTE]
