# Agile overview {#agile-overview}

Agile is a work methodology that allows teams to complete small, manageable amounts of work at a consistent cadence. In agile, teams manage stories on a backlog or story board and not tasks in a project. *`Adobe Workfront`* provides tools that help teams work in an agile way, using either Kanban or Scrum. For information on the Kanban and Scrum methodologies, see the section [Decide on an agile methodology](create-an-agile-team.md#deciding) in the article [Create an agile team](create-an-agile-team.md).


To begin using agile in *`Workfront`*:



1.  Create an agile team.


   For information, see the section [Create a new agile team](create-an-agile-team.md#creating-an-agile-team-from-scratch) or [Convert an existing team into an agile team](create-an-agile-team.md#converting-an-existing-team-into-an-agaile-team) in the article [Create an agile team](create-an-agile-team.md).

1.  Configure the agile team to use Kanban or Scrum.


   For information, see [Configure Kanban](configure-kanban.md) or [Configure Scrum](configure-scrum.md).

1.  Kanban teams: Manage the backlog and build the Kanban board.


   For information, see [Manage the agile backlog](manage-the-agile-backlog.md) and [Kanban overview](kanban-overview.md).

1.  Scrum teams: Manage the backlog, create an iteration, and build the Scrum board.


   For information, see [Manage the agile backlog](manage-the-agile-backlog.md), [Iterations overview](iterations-overview.md), and [Scrum board overview](scrum-board-overview.md).

1.  Add tasks from projects to the backlog or the story board for the team.


   For information, see [Manage the agile backlog](manage-the-agile-backlog.md), [Add existing tasks or issues to the Kanban board](add-existing-tasks-or-issues-to-the-kanban-board.md), and [Add stories to an existing iteration](add-stories-to-existing-iteration.md).
