# Code Samples

## PHP

The attached file "PHP.proofhq.uploader.two.scripts.with.callbacks.zip" contains a number of pages that demonstrates how a proof or file can be uploaded into the `Workfront Proof` system using PHP code. Additionally, they perform Callback actions when creating the `proof`.

The sample can be viewed by loading either the "proofhq. `proofs`.uploader.html" or "proofhq.files.uploader.html" in a web browser.

## .NET

The attached file "dot.NET.proofhq.login.and.get.sessionID.rar " contains a sample of how to log in to `Workfront Proof` system and see session ID using .NET code.&nbsp;

Please note that&nbsp;reference to our API must be added as Web Reference instead of Service Reference, as shown in attached screencast "dot.NET.reference.swf".&nbsp;

Result of incorrect reference can be:

```
"The top XML element 'result' from namespace '' references distinct types System.Boolean and ApprovalHQ.SOAPWorkflowTemplateObject. Use XML attributes to specify another XML name or namespace for the element or types."
```
