You can also request document approvals from people without Workfront accounts if your Workfront administrator has enabled this capability, as described in [Configure system security preferences](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/configure-security-preferences.md).

## Request a document approval

1. Go to the project, task, or issue that contains the document, then select **Documents**.
1. Find the document you need.

1. Scroll down to the **Approvals** section in the Summary, and begin typing in the **Add Approver** text box. You can add Workfront users by name or external users by email.

1. If your Adobe Workfront administrator has enabled the capability to collaborate with people who don't use Workfront, as described in [Configure system security preferences](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/configure-security-preferences.md), you can type their email addresses to include them.

   You cannot request approval from teams or groups.

1. Repeat the previous step to add other approvers.

## Resubmit an approval on a new version

Document approval decisions are not automatically reset when you upload a new version. For example, if your document is approved with changes, the decision will show "changes" as the decision, even if you upload a new version with the specified changes. You can clear the decision on a new version if you manually resubmit the approval.

1. Go to the project, task, or issue that contains the document, then select **Documents**.
1. Find the document you need.

1. Scroll down to the **Approvals** section in the Summary, click the More icon, then click Resubmit.

1. Go to the project, task, or issue that contains the document, then select **Documents**.
1. Find the document you need.
