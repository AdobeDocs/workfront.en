# Proof progress and status overview

You can view information about how a proof is progressing through the review process and see an overall summary of the proof's decision status from the Documents area.

## Proof progress overview

Proof progress indicates the work done on a proof from the time you send the proof to recipients to the time they make a decision on the proof. The progress icons, S, O, C, and D, appear next to the proof name and provide information about the proof's progress.

The progress icons can appear in the following colors to indicate certain information about the proof's progress:

* **Green**: Complete.
* **White**: Not complete.
* **Orange**:&nbsp;Not&nbsp;complete and deadline is less than 24 hours. 
* **Red**: Not&nbsp;complete and past the deadline.

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Workfront Proof uses the progress icons to track a proof's progress at each of the following levels:</p>
-->

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">For each reviewer, based on that person's activity on the proof.&nbsp;</li>
  -->

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">For each stage, based on the progress the reviewer on the stage who is most behind in the proofing process.&nbsp;To learn more about stages, see <a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/stages.md" class="MCXref xref">Automated Workflow Stages overview</a>.</li>
  -->

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">For the proof, based on the progress of the stage (group of reviewers) who is the most behind in the proofing process.</li>
  -->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">For an example of how Workfront Proof determines progress using the reviewer or stage that is most behind,&nbsp;suppose three reviewers on a proof need to make a&nbsp;decision. If two of them have made their&nbsp;decision&nbsp;but the third has not, the progress bar for the proof does not show&nbsp;the D in green because of the outstanding&nbsp;decision.</p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">If the Primary Decision Maker setting is selected on a proof and the primary decision maker submits a decision, the D in the proof progress bar turns&nbsp;green for all reviewers because no other decisions are required.</p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Similarly, if the Only One Decision Required setting is selected on a proof and any reviewer submits a decision, the D in the proof progress bar turns&nbsp;green for all reviewers because no other decisions are required.</p>
-->

## Proof status overview

The proof status displays&nbsp;the status of decisions that are required for&nbsp;the proof. The status of the proof is driven by the “worst case” participant. For example, suppose&nbsp;there are three&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;on the proof: two have the status of **Accepted**&nbsp;and one has the status of **Rejected**. The "worst case" decision of **Rejected** over-rules the other decisions and the overall status of the proof is shown as **Rejected**.&nbsp;

The standard status options are as follows:

* Pending
* Approved
* Approved with Changes
* Changes Required
* Not Relevant

If custom decisions are configured in your account, the status options reflect your&nbsp;custom decision&nbsp;settings.
