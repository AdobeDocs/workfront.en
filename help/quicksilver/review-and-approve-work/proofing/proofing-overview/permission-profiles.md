# Proof Permission Profile overview

<!--Audited: 12/2023-->

Proof Permission Profiles determine what overall permissions users have over all proofs in your account. Proof Permission Profiles are assigned to users in their User Profile. 

Proof Permission Profiles are different from proof roles. For more information about proof roles, see [Proof Roles overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/proof-roles.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are an Administrator, you can create custom profiles for users in your organization. For more information, see [Configure custom profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-custom-profiles.md).

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Consider the following about roles and permissions:</p>
-->

<!--
<ul data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<li> <p>Assigned profile permissions relate only to the users and items in your own account. The exception is in the case of Satellite accounts, where the Administrator and Billing Administrator for the main (hub) accounts can access and manage the account settings and billing of those accounts from the hub account level.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Billing Administrators and Administrators can delete users. This can only be done in Account settings.</p> </li>
<li>When Billing Administrators and Administrators view proofs that are owned by other users in their account, they view them with the role of a Reviewer.</li>
<li>Using the Read Only role, Billing Administrators and Administrators can access proofs in folders shared with them or in folders created by them. </li>
</ul>
-->
