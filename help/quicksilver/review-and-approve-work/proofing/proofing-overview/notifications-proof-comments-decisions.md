# Notifications for proof comments and decisions overview

You can receive email notifications about comments and decisions made on proofs you work on in one of the following ways:

* Receive an email when someone adds a comment, replies to a comment you have added, or makes a decision. 
* Receive an email when someone replies to a comment you have added. 
* Receive an email when someone makes a decision.
* Receive an email when someone makes the final decision.
* Receive an hourly summary email when someone replies to a comment you have added or makes a decision during the previous hour. 
* Receive a daily summary email when someone replies to a comment you have added or makes a decision during the day. 
* Receive no emails about comments or decisions.

The settings that determine how you receive email alerts about proof comments and decisions are available in the following places in Workfront:
