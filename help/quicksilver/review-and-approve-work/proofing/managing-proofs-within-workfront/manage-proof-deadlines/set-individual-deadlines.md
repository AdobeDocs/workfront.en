   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you do not see the new stage option, you must covert the workflow to an automated workflow first.

1. Add information for the stage,&nbsp;particularly the reviewer's name and the deadline you want for the reviewer.
1. Repeat the two previous steps as needed to add any other reviewers who need their own deadline.
