# Set individual reviewer deadlines

You can set different deadlines for different reviewers on a proof you have already created. This requires creating a&nbsp;separate stage for each reviewer for whom you want to set an individual deadline.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Pro or Higher</p> <p>or</p> <p>Legacy plan: Select or Premium</p> <p>For more information about proofing access with the different plans, see <a href="/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md" class="MCXref xref">Access to proofing functionality in Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Work or Plan</p> <p>Legacy plan: Any (You must have proofing enabled for the user)</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Proof Permission Profile </td> 
   <td>Manager or higher</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Proof Role</td> 
   <td>Author or Manager</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or Proof Permission Profile you have, contact your Workfront or Workfront Proof administrator.

## Set individual reviewer deadlines

1. Hover over the proof, then click **Proofing workflow** to open the Workflow page.
1. In the top-right corner, click **New stage**

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you do not see the new stage option, you must covert the workflow to an automated workflow first.

1. Add information for the stage,&nbsp;particularly the reviewer's name and the deadline you want for the reviewer.
1. Repeat the two previous steps as needed to add any other reviewers who need their own deadline.
