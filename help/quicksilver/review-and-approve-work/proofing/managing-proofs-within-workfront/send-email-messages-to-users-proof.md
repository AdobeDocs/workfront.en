# Send email messages to reviewers on a proof

During the review and approval process, you can send a message to one or all of the reviewers on a proof. Messages are an easy way to remind reviewers to complete their review of a proof or to provide other information related to the proof.

You can choose between sending a generic reminder email or sending a customized message to one or all of the users associated with a given stage.
