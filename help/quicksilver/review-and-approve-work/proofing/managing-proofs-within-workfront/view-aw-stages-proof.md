   The diagram for the Automated Workflow displays just below the Workflow title.

   The stages on the diagram are marked as follows:

   ![dot.png](assets/dot.png) Active stage

   ![grey_dot.png](assets/grey-dot.png) Inactive stage  
   ![sbw-key-icon.png](assets/sbw-key-icon.png)&nbsp; Private stage

   ![sbw-padlock-icon.png](assets/sbw-padlock-icon.png)&nbsp; Locked stage

   The lines between the stages depict the dependencies between the stages. The lines leading to inactive stages are dotted until the stage is activated.

   You can hover over a stage in the diagram to display its progress. If the stage is not active and you have edit rights on the stage, you can click the Activate stage button ![](assets/activate-stage-btn.png) to start the stage. If the stage is active and you have edit rights on the stage, you can lock it. ![](assets/lock-stage-btn.png) For more information about the Progress bar (S, O, C, D) , see&nbsp; [View the Progress and Status of a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/view-progress-and-status-of-proof.md).
