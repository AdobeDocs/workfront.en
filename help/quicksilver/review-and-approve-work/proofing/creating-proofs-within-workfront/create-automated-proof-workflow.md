# Create an advanced proof with an Automated workflow

<!-- Audited: 2/2024 -->

An Automated Workflow makes it easier to manage the review process if your process is complex, or if you send content for review to the same people regularly. The proof moves from stage to stage and Adobe Workfront notifies each user when it is their turn to review it. For more information about Automated workflows, see [Automated Workflow overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/automated-workflow.md).

## Create an advanced proof with an Automated workflow

1. Go to the project, task, or issue where you want the proof, then click the **Documents** tab.
1. Click **Add new** > Proof, upload the content, then work through the sections listed below.

   or

   Hover over an existing document, then click the **Create Proof** > **Advanced Proof** and work through the sections listed below.

## Configure the proof Stages

1. In the Workflow type section, choose **Automated**.
1. (Optional) If you want to use an Automated Workflow template that your Workfront administrator created and shared with you, click **Add template**, select the template in the box that appears, then click **Add template**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Consider the following when you use an Automated Workflow template:
   >   
   >* An Automated Workflow template's settings determine what you can do with the Automated Workflow for a proof. For example, if the Add a stage button disabled in the template, it is not visible as you work with the Automated Workflow settings for the proof. 
   >* When a person is added to a sage in an Automated Workflow template, but also already present as a reviewer on the proof, applying the template removes the reviewer from the stage. If you don't add another reviewer to the stage, a message will prompt you to add one. 
   >* Your ability to modify an Automated Workflow template depends on the template settings configured by the Workfront administrator, as described in . If the ability to modify the template is disabled, only the owner of the template can modify it.

1. Configure the first stage of the Automated Workflow:

   1. (Optional) If you want to create a name for the first stage, click **Stage 1**, then type the name.
   1. In the **Recipients** section for the stage, add reviewers to the stage.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >Consider the following when adding reviewers to a stage:
      >   
      >* You can add external users to a stage with an email address.
      >* After you add a user to a stage, you can configure settings for that user on the proof.
      >* You can drag users directly to another stage, or you can drag users to a stage on the **Stages** diagram. To select multiple users, press Shift+Ctrl (on Windows) or Shift+Command (on Mac).
      >* You can add a reviewer to a proof only once, which means that you cannot add the same person to more than one stage on the proof.
      >* Reviewers who are not added to a private stage cannot see that stage on the proof or comments made in that stage.
      >* By default, adding a user to a stage grants that user access to view the proof from the moment the proof is created. Your Workfront administrator can restrict users from accessing the proof until the workflow enters the stage where the user was added.

   1. Click **Stage settings**.
   1. Click an **Activate stage** option to indicate how you want the stage to activate.

      For the first stage, you can select only **On proof creation**, **On a specific date and time**, or **Manually**. 
   
   1. (Conditional) If you selected **On a specific date and time** in the previous step, select the date and time when you want to activate the stage in the **Activate on** box that appears.
   
   1. Use any of the options below to further configure the stage.

      <table style="table-layout:auto">
       <col>
       <col>
       <tbody>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Set stage deadline</td>
         <td><p>To set a deadline for the stage, click an option in the <strong>Deadline options</strong> drop-down list. Then, under <strong>Deadline</strong>, do one of the following:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>If you chose <strong>Set specific date</strong>: Select the deadline date and time you want.</li>
           <li>If you chose <strong>Calculate from stage activation date</strong>: Select the number of business days you want to add to the stage activation date to determine the deadline.</li>
          </ul></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Lock stage</td>
         <td>Specify when the stage can be locked. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Transfer primary decision rights to</td>
         <td><p>Select the Primary decision maker on the stage (available only after you add at least one person to the stage who has a Proof role of Approver or higher). If you select a Primary decision maker, the <strong>Only one decision required</strong> option is disabled on this stage.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Require only one decision for this stage</td>
         <td>Ends the entire review process when one of the decision makers makes a decision.<p>This option is not available if you designated a user in the <strong>Primary decision maker</strong>drop-down menu.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Make this stage private</td>
         <td>Allows only the following people to view comments and decisions made during this stage: Supervisors, Workfront administrators, and Workfront Proof administrators</td>
        </tr>
       </tbody>
      </table>

1. To add and configure another stage:

   1. Click **New stage**.
   1. (Optional) If you want to create a name for the first stage, click **Stage 2** (or **Stage 3**, **Stage 4**, and so on), then type the name.
   
   1. Click the **Activate stage**, then select an option to specify whether the stage is activated automatically or manually.

      In addition to the options **On proof creation**, **On a specific date and time**, or **Manually**, you can select an option that is dependent on what occurred in the previous step:

      ![Activate stage options](assets/activate-stage-options-for-stage-2-plus-350x177.png)

   1. If you selected an Activate stage option that is dependent on what occurred in the previous step, use the options that appear to configure the activation setting.

      For example, if you selected **When previous stage status changes**, select the **Previous stage**, then select the status in the **Status changed to** box.

1. Repeat the previous step as needed to add more stages.

   As you add stages to the Automated Workflow, a diagram forms on the screen to represent them:

      <td>Select this option to send an email notification to users. When <strong>Basic sharing</strong> is selected in the <strong>Workflow</strong> section, an email notification is sent when the proof is created. When <strong>Automated workflow</strong> is selected in the <strong>Workflow</strong> section, an email notification is sent when the proof enters the stage of the Automated Workflow that the user is associated with.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Add custom message</td>
      <td>Select this option to include a custom message in the notification. You can specify a subject and message body. The message body can include rich text formatting, such as bold, bullets, and hyperlinks.</td>
      </tr>

        </ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the proofs have Automated Workflow attached all subscriptions will generate confirmation emails to the proof Owners, so they could decide which stage the person should be added to.<br></p></p></td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **Create Proof**.

   Workfront begins generating a proof of the selected documents or websites. Depending on the file size and type, the lag time on a document upload can vary. Be patient as bigger files take longer to generate. You can navigate away from the page and Workfront continues to generate your file. The maximum file upload size is 4GB.

1. After the proof is generated, click **Open proof** to launch the proofing viewer.

   ![Open proof](assets/open-proof-350x132.png)

   Users who do not have proofing enabled on their account are still able to view the document and make comments to the proof [.](../../../timesheets/config-timesheet-prefs/config-time-logged-hrs-days.md)
