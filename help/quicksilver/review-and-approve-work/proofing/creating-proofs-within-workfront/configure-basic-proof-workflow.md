# Create an advanced proof with a Basic workflow

With a basic workflow, you can several reviewers to a proof, but they are not organized into stages. All of the reviewers you add can access the proof immediately after you create it.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Pro or Higher</p> <p>or</p> <p>Legacy plan: Select or Higher</p> <p>For more information about proofing access with the different plans, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md" class="MCXref xref">Access to proofing functionality in Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Work or Plan</p> <p>Legacy plan: Any (You must have proofing enabled for the user)</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Proof Permission Profile </td> 
   <td>Manager or higher</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or Proof Permission Profile you have, contact your Workfront or Workfront Proof administrator.

## Create an advanced proof with a Basic workflow

1. Go to the project, task, or issue where you want the proof, then click the **Documents** tab.

   | Notify recipients about this proof |Select this option to send an email notification to users. When **Basic sharing** is selected in the **Workflow** section, an email notification is sent when the proof is created. When **Automated workflow** is selected in the **Workflow** section, an email notification is sent when the proof enters the stage of the Automated Workflow that the user is associated with. |

1. Click **Create Proof**.

   Workfront&nbsp;begins generating a proof of the selected documents or websites.&nbsp;Depending on the file size and type, the lag time on a document upload can vary. Be patient as bigger files take longer to generate. You can navigate away from the page and Workfront&nbsp;continues to generate your file.&nbsp;The maximum file upload size is 4GB.

1. After&nbsp;the proof is generated, click&nbsp;**Open proof**&nbsp;to launch the proofing viewer.

   Users who do not have proofing enabled on their account&nbsp;are still able to view the document and make comments to the proof [.](../../../timesheets/config-timesheet-prefs/config-time-logged-hrs-days.md)
