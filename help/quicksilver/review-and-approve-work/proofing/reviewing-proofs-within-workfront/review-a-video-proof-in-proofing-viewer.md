  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or Proof Permission Profile you have, contact your Workfront or Workfront Proof administrator.

## Open and work with a video proof

1. Go to the document list that contains the video proof you want to open.
1. Hover over the document, then click&nbsp;**Open proof**.

   You can proof video content in the Web Proofing Viewer or the Desktop Proofing Viewer. The viewer that opens depends on how your Adobe Workfront administrator has configured your organization's proofing viewers.

1. Do any of the following:

* Comment on the proof, as explained in [Comment on a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/comment-on-proof.md).
* Use proofing viewer functionality described in the remaining sections below.

For information about creating a video proof, see .

For general information that relates to reviewing proofs, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

If you cannot use a proofing viewer as described in this section, consult your Workfront administrator.

## Change the unit of measurement of the timeline {#change-the-unit-of-measurement-of-the-timeline}

You can adjust the unit of measurement that is used in the video timeline. You can view the timeline in Time, Frame, or Timecode.

1. In the lower-left corner of the proofing viewer, click the current unit of measurement.

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Time</td> 
      <td>Displays the video timeline in minutes/seconds.<p>This option is selected by default.</p></td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Frame</td> 
      <td>Displays the video timeline in frames.<p>The proofing viewer uses the information on&nbsp;the original file to determine the number of frames per second that is displayed.</p></td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Timecode</td> 
      <td>Displays the video timeline in timecode. The numbers of the timecode represent hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. <p>For example, a timecode of 1:48:36:18 represents 1 hour, 48 minutes, 36 seconds, and 18 frames into the video.</p></td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

## Measure an area within a proof

1. Click the **Measure an area** icon at the top of the proofing viewer.
