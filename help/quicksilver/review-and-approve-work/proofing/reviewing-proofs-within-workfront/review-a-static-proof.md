  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or Proof Permission Profile you have, contact your Workfront or Workfront Proof administrator.

## Open and work with a proof

1. Go to the document list that contains the proof you want to open.
1. Hover over the document, then click&nbsp;**Open proof**.

   You can proof static content in the Web Proofing Viewer or the Desktop Proofing Viewer. The viewer that opens depends on how your Adobe Workfront administrator has configured your organization's proofing viewers.

1. Do any of the following:

* Comment on the proof, as explained in [Create and manage proof comments](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/create-manage-proof-comments.md).
* Use proofing viewer functionality described in the remaining sections below.

For information about creating a proof, see [Generate a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof.md).

For general information that relates to reviewing proofs, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

If you cannot use a Proofing Viewer as described in this section, consult your Workfront administrator.

## Change the view of your proof

You can view a static proof that contains multiple pages in a single view, in a continues view, or in a magazine view.

1. Locate the various view options in the upper-left section of the proofing viewer.

     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

## Use thumbnails

The thumbails panel displays on the left side of the proofing viewer. You can use the thumbnails area to navigate throughout the proof. Thumbnails are especially useful when a proof contains multiple pages.

* [Hide and display the thumbnails panel](#hiding-and-displaying-the-thumbnails-panel) 
* [Zoom and pan in the thumbnail view](#zooming-and-panning-in-the-thumbnails-panel)

### Hide and display the thumbnails panel

The thumbnails panel displays by default. You can hide or adjust the size of the panel.

* [Hide the thumbnails panel](#hiding-the-thumbnails-panel) 
* [Adjust the size of the thumbnails panel](#adjusting-the-size-of-the-thumbnails-panel)

#### **Hide the thumbnails panel**

1. Drag the edge to resize the panel.

### Zoom and pan in the thumbnail view

The zoom area in the thumbnails panel displays the area of the proof you are currently viewing. You can adjust the zoom within the thumbnail area or you can pan the area to view a different part of the proof.

You can also zoom and pan in the main area of the proof, as described in [Zoom and pan a proof](#zooming-and-panning-a-proof).

To zoom and pan in the thumbnail view:

1. Locate the current zoom area in the thumbnails panel.  
   The zoom area displays as a blue frame around the edges of the thumbnail.

   ![zoom_thumbnail_-_frame.png](assets/zoom-thumbnail---frame-350x215.png)

1. To adjust the size of the zoom area, drag the lower-right corner of the zoom area until it is the desired size.
1. To move the zoom area to another part of the proof, drag the zoom area until it covers the part of the proof you want to view.

## Search text within a proof

You can search text within any proof&nbsp;that is created from any of the following file types:

* PDF
* Office
* PSD
* Illustrator

To search text within proof:

1. Click the **Search document** icon above the proof.

   ![Search_icon_text_in_viewer.png](assets/search-icon-text-in-viewer-350x185.png)

1. In the search field that appears, type the text you want to search for.  
   The proofing viewer highlights the text you type within the proof.
1. Click the **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** icons to the right of the **Search documents** box to cycle through the search results.

For information about searching the comment list, see [Search the comment list](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/create-manage-proof-comments.md#searching-the-comment-list) in&nbsp; [Create and manage proof comments](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/create-manage-proof-comments.md).

## Measure an area within a proof

You can measure an area within a proof.

1. Click the **Measure an area** icon at the top of the proofing viewer.

   ![measurement_tool_button.png](assets/measurement-tool-button-350x128.png)

1. (Optional) Click&nbsp;**Measurement markup color**&nbsp;to expand the color options, then click a color and **Opacity** that is easy to see on your proof.  
   ![](assets/selection-color-350x330.png)

   The default measurement tool color is red.

   The proofing viewer remembers your color and opacity selections on all proofs you open until you clear your browser cache.

1. (Optional) Select a different&nbsp;**Unit of Measurement.**

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The Unit of Measurement options are available only for proofs created from a PDF.

1. Drag the measurement window to the area of the proof you need to measure.

   ![Measurement_tool_when_first_appears.png](assets/measurement-tool-when-first-appears-350x143.png)

1. Drag the corners or edges of the measurement window to resize it.
1. (Optional) If you need the measurement area to be an exact size, type **Selection size** values.
1. (Optional) If you need to measure a certain percentage within an area, check the calculate percentage box. A new box appears allowing you to adjust it  
   ![](assets/calculate-percentage-350x230.png)

## Rotate a proof

You can rotate the proof within the proofing viewer. When you rotate a proof that contains multiple pages, all pages are rotated simultaneously.

1. Click the **Rotate** icon at the bottom of the proofing viewer.

   ![proof_viewer_static_rotate.png](assets/proof-viewer-static-rotate-350x36.png)

   The proof is rotated 90 degrees each time you click the **Rotate** icon.

## Zoom and pan a proof

You can adjust the zoom percentage when viewing the proof. When viewing a proof at a larger zoom percentage, the Pan option allows you to use the cursor to navigate to different areas of the proof.

Alternatively, you can use the thumbnail area to zoom and pan within the proof, as described in [Zoom and pan a proof](#zooming-and-panning-a-proof).

1. Do any of the following to adjust the zoom percentage of the proof:

  * Click the **Zoom** icon, then either click on the proof to view the proof at a higher zoom level, or drag across an area of the proof to view only that area.

    ![change_zoom_percentage.png](assets/change-zoom-percentage-350x36.png)

  * Click the current zoom percentage, the click a new zoom percentage or click&nbsp;**Fit to width**, **Fit to height**, or **Fit to page**.

    ![zoom_percentage_menu.png](assets/zoom-percentage-menu-350x245.png)
