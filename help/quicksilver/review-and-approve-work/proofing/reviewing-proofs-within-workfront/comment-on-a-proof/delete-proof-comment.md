# Delete proof comments

You can delete a comment or a reply to a comment as long as no one has already replied to it. It is usually better to resolve a&nbsp;comment rather than delete it. For more information, see [Resolve proof comments](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/resolve-proof-comments.md).
