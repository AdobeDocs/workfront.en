# Review interactive content with the Adobe Workfront review tool

<span class="preview">The Adobe Workfront Review tool will be available on November 1, 2024.</span>

The Adobe Workfront review tool is a browser extension that allows you to proof interactive content in a ZIP file or with a URL. The Adobe Workfront review tool is available in the following browsers:

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Edge

For websites that prevent opening their site in iFrames, such as Figma, we recommend using Desktop Proof Viewer.

## Prerequisites

To use the web review tool, a Workfront Administrator must disable the setting that opens the Desktop Proofing Viewer automatically for interactive content:

1. In Workfront's Main Menu, click **Proofing**.
1. Click **Account settings**, then click the **Settings** tab.
1. In the **Proof Defaults** section, find **Desktop Proofing Viewer for Interactive proofing** and click **Setup**.
1. In the drop-down menu, choose **Disabled**.
1. Click **Save**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This change applies to all interactive proofs in your Preview and Production environments. We recommend testing the new experience in your Preview environment before enabling it in Production. You can easily switch back to the Desktop Viewer by changing the account setting back to either **Enabled for all interactive proofs** or **Enabled only for interactive proofs created from a URL**. 


## Install the extension

Reviewers and approvers must install the Adobe Workfront review in one of the following browsers:

* [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adobe-workfront-review-tool/)

* [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adobe-workfront-review-to/lhdepbgeilldghlfnankdnponhljpgml) 

* [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/adobe-workfront-review-to/llhapmaiiddmcamgeapaipjpagnoijen) 

Once you install the extension, interactive proofs open in the Adobe Workfront review tool automatically. 

 
The setting to open the Desktop Proofing Viewer for Interactive Proofing must be disabled to use the Workfront review tool. See the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above for information on disabling this setting.
