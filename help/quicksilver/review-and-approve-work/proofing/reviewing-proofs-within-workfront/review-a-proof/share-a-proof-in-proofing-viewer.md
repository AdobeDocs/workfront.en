# Share a proof from the proofing viewer

You can share a proof from the proofing viewer if sharing is enabled by the proof owner or creator.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Allow sharing proof via public URL or embed code setting must be enabled.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Pro or Higher</p> <p>or</p> <p>Legacy plan: Select or Premium</p> <p>For more information about proofing access with the different plans, see .</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Work or Plan</p> <p>Legacy plan: Any (You must have proofing enabled for the user)</p> </td>

  </tr> 
  <tr>

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or Proof Permission Profile you have, contact your Workfront or Workfront Proof administrator.

## Share the URL

You can share a proof via a URL if the owner has configured the proof for sharing. Proof owners can update sharing settings any time. For more information, see [Edit proof settings](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/edit-proof-settings.md).

1. If the left icon menu is not displayed, click the **Menu** icon on the upper-left corner of the proofing viewer.

1. In the **Share proof** options that appear, make sure **Get shareable link** is selected.

1. &nbsp;Do either of the following:

   * To copy the link to your clipboard, click **Copy link**.

     You can now distribute the link via a third-party tool, such as a chat or an email application.
   
   * To email the link directly from Adobe Workfront, do the following:

      1. In the **Or email link to** field, begin typing and select the name of your recipient. Or specify the email address of an external user who you want to share with.

         >[!NOTE]
         >
         >If you see an alias email when sharing a proof, don't create a new guest user by entering the original email if a corresponding alias email exists.

      1. Select from the following options:

         <table>
          <col>
          <col>
          <tbody>
           <tr>
            <td role="rowheader">Send public link</td>
            <td><p>Includes a button in the email notification that directs users to the proof within the proofing viewer they are using and grants View access.</p><p>If <strong>Subscribe to proof via public URL or embed code</strong> is turned off for the proof, users can sign in with their Workfront login credentials to add comments to the proof. If it is turned on, anyone providing their email address and name (no password required) can sign and add comments to the proof.</p></td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
            <td role="rowheader">Send download link</td>
            <td>Includes a button in the email notification that directs users to a download page, which provides file details, file name, and file size, with the file displayed inline. Users can click the Download link from the download page to download the file.</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
            <td role="rowheader">Add custom message</td>
            <td>Allows you to specify a custom subject and body for the email notification.</td>
           </tr>
          </tbody>

1. In the **Share proof** options that appear, click **Get embed code**, then click **Copy**.

## Share a proof by adding users to it

You can add users to a proof while reviewing a proof if you have any of the following permissions:

* Supervisor or Administrator permissions
* Manager permissions and you are the proof creator or owner
* Manager permissions with the Author or Moderator proof role

If the proof has an Automated Workflow, you can add the user to an individual stage. For more information, see [Automated Workflow overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/automated-workflow.md).

By default, users you add to the proof:

* Receive an email notification with a link to the proof.
* Can make approval decisions on the proof from the Home or My Work area, as described in [Approving work](../../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approving-work.md).
* Do not need to have proofing enabled in order to review the proof.

When Automated Workflow is enabled and you add a user to the proof who does not have proofing enabled in Workfront, a new stage is created within the Automated Workflow. The user who you are adding is automatically added to this new stage when they view the proof for the first time. For more information, see [Automated Workflow overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/automated-workflow.md).

To share a proof with individual users:

1. In the toolbar on the left of the proofing viewer, click the **Share**&nbsp;icon.

   ![Share_btn_in_viewer__2_.png](assets/share-btn-in-viewer--2-.png)

1. Click **Add recipients** in the list on the left.
1. Under&nbsp;**New proof recipients**, begin typing the name of a user who you want to share the proof with, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.
1. (Optional) Change any reviewer options to the right of the person's name:

   * **Proof role**: For more information, see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](../../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).
   
   * **Stage**: (Available only if the proof has an Automated Workflow). For more information, see&nbsp; [Automated Workflow Stages overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/stages.md).
   
   * **Email alerts**:&nbsp;Select one of the following options to specify how the person will be notified about activity on the proof.

     <table> 
      <col> 
      <col> 
      <tbody> 
       <tr> 
        <td role="rowheader">All activity</td> 
        <td>Workfront sends an email to the reviewer every time there is any activity on the proof, such as&nbsp;a new&nbsp;comment, reply, or&nbsp;decision. <p>This is a great option for the person who is managing the proofing process because&nbsp;it allows them to see the activity as it happens. </p><p>Users do not receive an email alert about their own activity.</p></td> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td role="rowheader">Replies to my comments</td> 
        <td>An email is sent to the reviewer only if someone replies explicitly to their&nbsp;comment&nbsp;(this excludes their own replies on their own comments).
