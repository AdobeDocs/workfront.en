# Approve a proof

When a user adds you to a proof and grants either the Approver role or the Reviewer & Approver role, the approval request displays in the Home area. You can then view the proof and make an approval decision on the proof directly from Adobe Workfront. For information about how to make approval decisions from the Home area, see [Approving work](../../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approving-work.md).
