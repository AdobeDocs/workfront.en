1. Sort your users by **Access Level**. We recommend batch editing by Access Level to ensure the **Proof Permission Profile** field appears. 

1. Click the checkbox next to the users you want to select within the same access level. The Proof Permission Profile field is available only for Worker access levels and above.
1. Click **Edit** at the top of the list.
1. In the **Access** section, find the **Proof Permission Profile** drop-down menu and make your selection.

   >[!NOTE]
