## Edit the Proof Permission Profile field in Bulk

{{step-1-to-users}}

1. Sort your users by **Access Level**. We recommend batch editing by Access Level to ensure the **Proof Permission Profile** field appears. 

1. Click the checkbox next to the users you want to select within the same access level. The Proof Permission Profile field is available only for Worker access levels and above.
1. Click **Edit** at the top of the list.
1. In the **Access** section, find the **Proof Permission Profile** drop-down menu and make your selection.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Depending on your Workfront plan, you may have to enable the **User can generate proofs** checkbox in order for the **Proof Permission Profile** menu to appear.
