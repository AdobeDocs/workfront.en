# Proof a PowerPoint with an embedded video

You can review a proof for a PowerPoint with an embedded video using the Desktop Proofing Viewer.

## Create the proof

1. Open the PowerPoint you want to proof, and find the Share link. 
1. Copy the link, and go to the **Documents** area to create the proof.
1. Click **Add New** > **Proof**.
1. Paste the link in the share your link box. 
1. Continue configuring the proof as needed, then click **Create Proof**.

This creates an interactive proof where the video can be reviewed inside of the PowerPoint. You must use the Desktop Proofing Viewer to review interactive proofs. See the section below for more information. 

## Review the proof

1. Install the desktop proofing view as described in [Install the desktop proofing viewer](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/use-the-desktop-proofing-viewer/installing-desktop-proofing-viewer.md).
1. Once the viewer is installed, navigate to the proof and open it. The Desktop Proofing Viewer automatically opens if the proof was created as an interactive proof as described in the section above.
