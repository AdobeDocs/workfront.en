# Proof versions cannot be downloaded or previewed when an interactive proof is added as a new version

## Problem

When a user adds an interactive proof as a new version to a [static proof (.pdf, .png, .jpg, etc)](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md#static-files), all previous versions are no longer accessible to download or preview. 

## Solution

Open the static version in the Proofing Viewer, then click **Download** in the side panel.
