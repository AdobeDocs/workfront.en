# Adobe Enterprise Storage Management overview

At the core of this integration is Adobe Enterprise Storage Management (ESM)â€”a cloud-based storage solution that serves as the central repository for assets across Adobe enterprise products, including Workfront and Frame.io.

Adobe ESM is designed to provide a unified storage layer, centralized permissions, and end-to-end asset visibility for enterprises using Adobe's suite of products.

## Key Features

* **Unified Storage Layer**: ESM acts as a shared storage backend for Workfront, Frame.io, Document Cloud, and Creative Cloud. This enables seamless collaboration and asset management across these platforms.

* **Content Supply Chain (CSC) Enablement**: ESM is a foundational component for Adobe's Content Supply Chain vision, allowing teams to manage work-in-progress (WIP) assets without the need for manual downloads or reuploads.

* **Centralized Permissions & Access**: ESM supports enterprise-level access controls, integrating with Adobe IMS (Identity Management System) for secure and scalable user permissions.

* **End-to-End Asset Visibility**: Assets stored in ESM can be surfaced and managed directly in Workfront, Frame.io, and CC apps, providing consistent metadata, versioning, and audit trails.

* **Integration with Review & Approval Workflows**: ESM enables creative review and approval workflows by serving as the source of truth for all assets, ensuring that feedback and approvals are tracked centrally.

* **Scalable Storage & Quota Management**: ESM offers scalable storage options and unified quota tracking across Adobe products.
