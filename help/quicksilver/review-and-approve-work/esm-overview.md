# Adobe Enterprise Storage Management overview

Adobe Enterprise Storage Management (ESM) is a cloud-based storage solution that serves as the central repository for assets across Adobe enterprise products. The Workfront and Frame.io integration is built on ESM, enabling seamless collaboration and asset management between these platforms. it also alters the existing workfront document experience.

This also paves the way for future asset management integrations with other Adobe products, such as Adobe Creative Cloud. 

## Key Features

* **Unified storage layer**: ESM acts as a shared storage backend for Workfront, Frame.io, Document Cloud, and Creative Cloud. This enables seamless collaboration and asset management across these platforms.

* **Content supply chain enablement**: ESM is a foundational component for Adobe's Content Supply Chain vision, allowing teams to manage work-in-progress assets without the need for manual downloads or reupload in various Adobe applications.

* **Centralized permissions and access**: ESM supports enterprise-level access controls, integrating with Adobe IMS (Identity Management System) for secure and scalable user permissions.

* **End-to-end asset visibility**: Assets stored in ESM can be surfaced and managed directly in Workfront, Frame.io, and Creative Cloud apps, providing consistent metadata, versioning, and audit trails.

* **Integration with review and approval workflows**: ESM enables creative review and approval workflows by serving as the source of truth for all assets, ensuring that feedback and approvals are tracked centrally.

* **Scalable storage and quota management**: ESM offers scalable storage options and unified quota tracking across Adobe products.

## Integration with review and approval workflows

The Workfront and Frame.io integration leverages ESM to provide a unified review and approval experience. This integration allows project coordinators to manage projects and plan work in Workfront while creatives, marketers, and stakeholders can review and approve assets in Frame.io. This ensures that all stakeholders have access to the latest versions of assets, and feedback is centralized in one place.
