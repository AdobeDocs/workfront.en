# Limited document and proof decision for non-paid users overview

Proof and document decisions are limited for all non-paid Workfront licenses on the new plans. When you are assigned as an approver for a document or proof, you must make a decision to move the review and approval process forward. 

The following decision types count towards the monthly limit:

<table>
  <tr>
  
   <td><strong>Legacy document approvals</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Unified approvlas</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Proof approvals</strong> 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
   <ul>
   <li>Approve</li>
    <li>Approve with changes</li>
     <li>Reject</li>
   </ul>
   </td>
   <td>
      <ul>
   <li>Approve</li>
    <li>Approve with changes</li>
     <li>Needs work</li>
   </ul>
   </td>
   <td>
      <ul>
   <li>Approve</li>
    <li>Approve with changes</li>
     <li>Changes required</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Note</strong>: Proof approvals can have custom decision labels</p>
  </tr>
  </tr>
</table>



## Limits

Limits reset on a per-user basis each month. The decision limits for each license differ depending on the plan you're on: 

<table>
  <tr>
   <td> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>External</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Contributor</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Light</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Standard</strong> 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Select</strong> 
   </td>
   <td>3 
   </td>
   <td>3 
   </td>
   <td rowspan="3" >Unlimited 
   </td>
   <td rowspan="3" >Unlimited 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Prime</strong> 
   </td>
   <td>5 
   </td>
   <td>5 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Ultimate</strong> 
   </td>
   <td>7 
   </td>
   <td>7 
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## External users 

If an external user reaches their decision limit, they will not lose access to Workfront and will still be able to make decisions. Adobe Workfront will evaluate overages. 

## Contributor users 

Once a user with a Contributor license reaches their decision limit, they will be automatically upgraded to the Light license with unlimited proof and document decisions. For more information about the Light license, see the [Light access level](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/how-access-levels-work/access-level-overview.md) section in the [Access levels overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/how-access-levels-work/access-level-overview.md) article.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Workfront administrator will receive an email notification regarding this upgrade.
