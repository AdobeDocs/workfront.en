# Limited document and proof decision for non-paid users overview

Proof and document decisions are limited for all non-paid Workfront licenses on the new plans. For more information, see [New licenses overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/how-access-levels-work/licenses-overview.md). 

Limits reset on a per-user basis each month. The decision limits for each license differ depending on the plan you're on: 

<table>
  <tr>
   <td> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>External</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Contributor</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Light</strong> 
   </td>
   <td><strong>Standard</strong> 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Select</strong> 
   </td>
   <td>3 
   </td>
   <td>3

   <td rowspan="3" >Unlimited

   <td rowspan="3" >Unlimited 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Prime</strong> 
   </td>
   <td>5

   <td>5

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Ultimate</strong> 
   </td>
   <td>7 
   </td>
   <td>7 
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## External users 

If an external user reaches their decision limit, they will not lose access to Workfront and will still be able to make decisions. Adobe Workfront will evaluate overages. 

## Contributor users 

Once a user with a Contributor license reaches their decision limit, they will be automatically upgraded to the Light license with unlimited proof and document decisions. For more information about the Light license, see the [Light access level](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/how-access-levels-work/access-level-overview.md) section in the [Access levels overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/how-access-levels-work/access-level-overview.md) article.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Workfront administrator will receive an email notification regarding this upgrade.
