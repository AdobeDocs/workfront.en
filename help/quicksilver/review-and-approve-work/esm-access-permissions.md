If on WF storage, documetns are wholly containted in workfront and access level logic fully restricts viewing access.

If ESM, Documents access - you cannot change access levels to have no access or view access to document. They also always have the option to create, delete, and share.

Also if ESM, the option to never inherit document access permissions is no longer there.

Document access cannot be restricted at the access level for ESM projects.

project name also available outside of WF for ESM projects, programs, portfolios. templates
