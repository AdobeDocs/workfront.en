# Review and approve with the Frame.io viewer

You can review and approve documents directly in the Frame.io viewer, which provides a seamless experience for stakeholders.

## Review documents

As a reviewer, you can add comments and mark up to assets. Once finished, you can mark your review complete in Workfront. Marking the review as complete is not required for the asset to move forward in the approval process.

1. Go to your review email notification, and click to **Go to review**.
1. In Frame.io, use the commenting tools to leave feedback or ask questions.
    Comments and asset markup is visible only in the Frame.io viewer. For more information on using the Frame.io viewer, see [Commenting on your media](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/9105251-commenting-on-your-media).
1. Once you're satisfied with the document, navigate back to the Document Details page in Workfront and mark your review as complete.

1. Go to your review email notification, and click to **Go to review**.

## Create a new version as needed

If you need another round of review and approval on a document, you can create a new document version in Workfront.

You can add the previous participants, new participants, or a mix of both. You can view information about previous versions and participants on the Document Details page. 

To add a new version:

1. Navigate to the document in Workfront.
1. Drag and drop the new file on top of the previous document. This automatically creates a new version. 

1. Once the document finishes uploading, select the document, then click **Create proof** > **Simple proof**.

1. Scroll down to the Approvals section, then click **Add**.

1. (Optional) Choose an existing approval template. Users with a Standard license can create resuable Approval Templates from the Setup area. For more information, see [Create an Approval Template for assets and documents](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-approval-template.md).

1. (Optional) Set a deadline for the approval. Users and teams are notified by email 72 hours, then 24 hours before the specified deadline.

1. To add an approver, click the Approver button and begin typing in a user or team name, or choose an approver from the previous version.

1. To add a reviewer, click the Reviewer button and begin typing in a user or team name, choose a reviewer from the previous version.

<!-- add info about reusing previous participants once released -->


## Review the proof and make a decision

The document does not move to an approved status until all assigned approvers choose "approved".

If any one approver chooses "needs work", the status of the document immediately changes to Needs work. The document needs to be revised and uploaded as a new version with a new approval workflow. 

To review and approve a document:

1. Go to your review email notification, and click to **Go to review**.

1. Once you're in Workfront, click **Go to proof**.

1. Review the content, and add any comments or markup. For more information about how to use the proofing viewer, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront: article index](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

1. Choose one of the following decisions:

    * **Approve**: The document does not need changes and is ready for use.
    * **Approve with changes**: The document needs changes and is ready for use once they are made. Additional approval is not required. 
    * **Needs work**: The document needs changes and is not ready for use. Once the specified changes are made, the document must be uploaded as a new version and go through another round of approvals. For more information on uploading a new version, see [ Create a new version as needed](#create-a-new-version-as-needed) in this article.

Once you make a decision, the document owner is notified via email.
