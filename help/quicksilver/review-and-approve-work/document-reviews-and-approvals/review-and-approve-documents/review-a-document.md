# Review a document

As a reviewer, you can view a document that has been submitted to you for review. Unlike an approval, you do not make a decision. Instead, you confirm that you have reviewed the asset.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The content of this article refers to updated document approval functionality that is only available for specific accounts. For information on standard approval processes, see the articles listed in [Work approvals](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/manage-approvals.md).
