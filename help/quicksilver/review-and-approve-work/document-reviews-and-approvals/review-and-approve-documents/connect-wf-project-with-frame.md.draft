# Connect a Workfront project to a Frame.io project

You can connect a Workfornt project to a Frame.io project to streamlight the review and approval process between the two applications. We are actively improving this feature.

## Access requirements

## Prerequisites

* You must have a Workfront group connected to a Frame.io team. For more info, see [Connect a Workfront group to a Frame.io team](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/review-and-approve-documents/connect-wf-to-frame.md). 

## Create the project and add a connected group 

{{step1-to-projects}}

1. Create a new project from scratch or a template. For information on how to create a project, see [Create a project](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md). 

1. In the left panel, find **Project Details**. 

1. Find the **Group** field on the right side of the screen, and remove the Default group.  

1. In the drop-down menu, find the desired group. Groups connected with Frame.io display the Frame.io icon.

1. Click **Save Changes**. A Frame.io icon displays next to the project name. 

1. Assign users to teams tasks. 

>[!NOTE]

>Users or teams added to the tasks are also added to the Frame.io project. 


1. Upload any documents or creative briefs in the Project Documents area. 

The project is still not connected, you must continue to the next section to finish the integration. 

## Enable the project in Frame.io 

1. Change the status from **Planning** to **Current** or a custom status that equals current. This finishes the integration and generates the project, tasks, and any documents in Frame.io. 

The frame icon next to the project name turns purple signaling the integration was successful.
