# Connect a Workfront project to a Frame.io project

You can connect a Workfornt project to a Frame.io project to streamlight the review and approval process between the two applications. We are actively improving this feature.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

1. In the left panel, find **Project Details**. 

1. Find the **Group** field on the right side of the screen, and remove the Default group.  

1. In the drop-down menu, find the desired group. Groups connected with Frame.io display the Frame.io icon.

The project is still not connected, you must continue to the next section to finish the integration. 

## Enable the project in Frame.io 

1. Change the status from **Planning** to **Current** or a custom status that equals current. This finishes the integration and generates the project, tasks, and any documents in Frame.io. 

The frame icon next to the project name turns purple signaling the integration was successful.
