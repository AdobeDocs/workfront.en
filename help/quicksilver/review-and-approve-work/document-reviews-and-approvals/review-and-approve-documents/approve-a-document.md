## Approve a document from Home

1. Click the **Home** icon ![](../assets/home-icon-30x29.png) in the upper-left corner of Adobe Workfront.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Your Workfront administrator might make the following changes to the Home icon in your environment:
   >
   >* Replace it with an image customized to illustrate your organization. In this case, the icon will look different that shown in this article.
   >
   >* Replace the page linked to it with a different page. In this case, click the **Main Menu** ![](../assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of the page, then click **Home**.

1. Click **Filters** at the top left of the page and ensure that **Approvals** is checked.
  
   All work items that require your approval are displayed in the list.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Approvals assigned to Job Roles or Groups aren't listed in Home. Approvals assigned to Teams display in the Team Request grouping in the Work List.

1. Click on the document approval in the list for which you want to make an approval decision. Information regarding the approval will appear on the right side of the page.

1. Click one of the following two approval options in the top-right corner of the page:
   
   * The **Approve** dropdown contains two options:
      
      * **Approve** indicates that no changes are needed for this version of the document and that approval is given.

      * **Approve with changes** indicates that some small changes are still required on the document, but approval is given on the condition that those changes are made. If you select this option, a window will appear that contains a text box named **Next steps** where you can specify what changes are needed for the document to be approved. You may either enter that information and click **Add message**, or you may click **Skip** to send the approval decision without additional information.
   
   * **Needs work** indicates that the document version is not approved and requires significant changes.  
   
   Consider the following when viewing document approvals in Home:
      
      * The name of the user who requested the approval is displayed above the document name in Home with the text "*User A* would like your approval on...", as well as under **Submitted By** in the approval information that displays on the right once an approval is selected.
      
      * After a decision is made on an approval, the approval remains in the My Approvals tab with the text "Decision Made" until you click the **Refresh** button, or until you refresh the browser page.

## Approve a document from the document page

1. Go to the document page by clicking on the name of the document.

   If the currently selected version of the document has a pending approval for you, the approval decision buttons are displayed in the top-right corner of the page; if other versions of the document have pending approvals for you, the version dropdown menu displays a red dot.
