## Proof approvals 

Explain that customers can still use proofing alone or with new document approvals. 

Explain that proofing capabilities will always be available in Workfront, but may not always be through proof HQ. -I think we need to let them know that proof HQ will eventually go away, but I don't want to cause panic either. I'm nervous about this one, so feedback from support/PM is appreciated.
