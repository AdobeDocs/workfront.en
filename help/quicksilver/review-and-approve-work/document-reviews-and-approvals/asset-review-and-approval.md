## Document approvals 

Explain that legacy document approvals will be removed from Workfront in 2025. Introduce new approvals as a replacement and highlight functionality that comes with new document approvals: 

Can use new document approvals with the proofing viewer 

Can have both approvers and reviewers 

Can have deadlines 

Can use templates 

Can approve in the proofing viewer – this is an item that is coming soon. I'll mark it with a badge 

Can use multi-stage approvals – this is an item that is coming soon. I'll mark it with a badge

## roof approvals 

Explain that customers can still use proofing alone or with new document approvals. 

Explain that proofing capabilities will always be available in Workfront, but may not always be through proof HQ. -I think we need to let them know that proof HQ will eventually go away, but I don't want to cause panic either. I'm nervous about this one, so feedback from support/PM is appreciated.
