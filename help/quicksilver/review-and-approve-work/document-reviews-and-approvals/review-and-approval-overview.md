Need intro

## Work initiation and planning

Explain high-level workflow here with example

### Enable Frame.io users in Workfront 

Workfront users who regularly use Frame.io should be marked as a Frame.io users in their user profile.

Workfront administrators can designate Frame.io users in the Workfront User Profile. Users marked as Frame.io users are granted a Frame.io Collaborator license, saving the project coordinator extra coordination steps.

<!-- check list for users who should be marked as frame enabled? -->

When a user is marked as a Frame.io user in Workfront and is added to a project that is connected with Frame.io

* They are added as a Collaborator in Frame.io
* Tasks assigned to them appear as a folder inside of Frame.io
* They can send assets from Frame.io to Workfront for formal review and approval

### Attach a Frame.io account to groups

In the group area, add the frame.io account the projects will be created in
<!-- need more info on this one -->

### Create a project integrated with Frame.io

Project managers and coordinators can create Workfront projects integrated with Frame.io. For more information on created an integrated projects, see [].

When you create an integrated project, you can

* You can assigned Frame.io enabled users, desinated by the Workfront administrator, to tasks in Workfront and have a corresponding folder created inside of Frame.io. Frame.io enabled users are notified by email when a task is assigned to them and they have work to begin.

* Send instructions and materials from Workfront directly to the creative user in Frame.io using a one-way sync folder. Simply drop the documents into the **Share with Frame.io** folder.

* Track the progress of work as creatives mark tasks complete directly inside of Frame.io.

## Content creation and collaboration

Creatives can stay in their tools of choice and have the freedom to create, iterate, and conduct peer reviews inside of Frame.io. 

When a creative is added to an integrated project they can do all of the following without leaving Frame.io, 

* Access instructions from the project coordinator
* Conduct informal peer reviews
* Send finished assets to Workfront for formal review and approval
* Change the status of a task or mark it complete

### Launch formal reviews and approvals in Workfont

You can create one-time review and approvals or you can create resuable approval templates in the Setup area of workfront. 

Reviewers - view, make comments, don't make decisions
Approvers - make decison

**Single-use approvals**
Set approval deadlines


**Multi-stage approvals** Coming soon
<!-- need more info on this one -->

**Generative approvals** Include?

**Approval templates**

In the Workfront Setup area, users with a Standard license can create resuable Approval Templates. Within a template, users can specifiy a timeframe and add reviewers and approvers. <!--do we want to mention any upcoming plans here? -->

Once a template is created, it can be applied to assets sent from Frame.io to begin the formal review and approval process in Workfront.
