# Asset review and approval overview

The new Asset review and approval workflow is built around a tight integration between Workfront and Frame.io. This integration takes the best of what each product has to offer and combines it to create an experience that allows all personas involved in content creation to work in their tools of choice, while having access to comments, files, and status updates synchronized across both systems in real time.

## Work initiation and planning in Workfront

The project coordinator begins in Workfront. The project is created, tasks are assigned, intructions are sent.

Campaign manager creates WF project, uses synced project folder to send     information and supporting materials to creatives inside Frame.io 

Set up approval workflow from scratch or via templates 

Assign tasks 

Sets project to Current or equal to create frame project and alert creatives 

### Enable Frame.io users

Workfront users who regularly use Frame.io should be marked as a Frame.io users in their user profile by their Workfront administrator

Workfront administrators can designate Frame.io users in the Workfront User Profile. Users marked as Frame.io users are granted a Frame.io Collaborator license, saving the project coordinator extra coordination steps.

<!-- check list for users who should be marked as frame enabled? -->

When a user is marked as a Frame.io user in Workfront and is added to a project that is connected with Frame.io:

* They are added as a Collaborator in Frame.io
* Tasks assigned to them appear as a folder inside of Frame.io
* They can send assets from Frame.io to Workfront for formal review and approval

### Create a project integrated with Frame.io

Project managers and coordinators can create Workfront projects integrated with Frame.io. For more information on created an integrated projects, see [].

When you create an integrated project, you can

* You can add Frame.io enabled users, desinated by the Workfront administrator, to tasks in Workfront. A folder to represent the task is created automatically inside of Frame.io. Frame.io enabled users are notified by email when a task is assigned to them and they have work to begin.

* Send instructions and materials from Workfront directly to the creative user in Frame.io using a one-way sync folder. Simply drop the documents into the **Share with Frame.io** folder.

* Track the progress of work as creatives mark tasks complete directly inside of Frame.io.



## Content creation and collaboration in Frame.io

Creatives can stay in their tools of choice and have the freedom to create, iterate, and conduct peer reviews inside of Frame.io. 

When a creative is added to an integrated project they can do all of the following without leaving Frame.io, 

* Access instructions from the project coordinator
* Conduct informal peer reviews
* Send finished assets to Workfront for formal review and approval
* Change the status of a task or mark it complete
