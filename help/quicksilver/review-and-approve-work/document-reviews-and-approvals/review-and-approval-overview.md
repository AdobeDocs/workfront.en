# Asset review and approval overview

Need inro

## Work initiation and planning

The review and approval process begins in Workfront. 

### Enable Frame.io users in Workfront

Workfront administrators need to designate users who need to review assets in Frame.io 

When a user is marked as a Frame.io user in Workfront and is added to a project that is connected with Frame.io

* They are added as a collaborator in Frame.io
* Tasks assigned to them appear as a folder inside of Frame.io
* They can send assets from Frame.io to Workfront for formal review and approval





Users who need to review assets in Frame.io must be marked as a Frame.io user in Workfront. Frame.io users are automatically granted access to connected Frame.io projects. 


### Create a project integrated with Frame.io

### Create approval templates
