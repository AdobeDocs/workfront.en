To create a an approval workflow:

1. Go to the project, task, or issue that contains the document, then select **Documents** in the left panel.

1. Click on the document you need and the Document Summary panel for that document will open.

1. Select the version of the document you would like to create an approval for in the version dropdown. The latest version is selected by default.

1. Scroll down to the **Approvals** section, then click **Create workflow**.

1. Fill in the following details:

   <table>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Stage name</strong></td>
   <td>Add a stage name. You can change the name to something more descriptive, such as <em>Initial Review</em> or <em>Final Approval</em>.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Add names or emails</strong></td>
   <td>Begin typing a user or team name to add as an approver or reviewer. If you only have reviers, they will be notified and have the option to complete the review but no decision will be required or made.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>One decision required (optional)</strong></td>
   <td>The first person who makes a decision completes the stage.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Due date (optional)</strong></td>
   <td>Set a due date for the approval. Users and teams are notified by email 72 hours, then 24 hours before the specified due date.</td>
   </tr>
   </table>

1. (Optional) Repeat the previous step to add additional stages as needed.

   >[!NOTE]

## Resubmit an approval on a new version

Document approval decisions are not automatically reset when you upload a new version. For example, if your document is approved with changes, the decision will show "changes" as the decision, even if you upload a new version with the specified changes. You can clear the decision on a new version if you manually resubmit the approval.

1. Go to the project, task, or issue that contains the document, then select **Documents**.
1. Find the document you need.

1. Scroll down to the **Approvals** section in the Summary, click the More icon, then click Resubmit.
