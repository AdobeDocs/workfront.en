# New Document Approvals overview

New Document Approvals is a wholistic redesign of the existing approvals process that is currently in development for Adobe Workfront. Currently available in limited release, it is designed to be a practical and effective solution for businesses requiring comprehensive stakeholder engagement and version-specific document approvals. Its thoughtful design and purposeful new features facilitate collaboration, role clarity, and version control in the approval process, enhancing efficiency and accountability.

## New features and design goals

* **Inclusive stakeholder participation**\
    New Document Approvals allow the inclusion of both individual contributors and entire teams in the approval process. Facilitating this broader participation ensures comprehensive stakeholder engagement and fosters a more informed and collaborative decision-making environment.

* **Differentiated review and approval roles**\
    New Document Approvals is designed to recognize and respect the varying roles within the approval process. By providing the ability to identify and designate reviewers—users who are notified to provide feedback but do not have decision-making authority—the quality of feedback is enhanced while maintaining clarity of final approval authority.

* **Version-specific approvals**\
    The iterative nature of document development often leads to multiple versions of the same document. New Document Approvals accommodates this reality by providing unique approval chains for each version of a document. This allows users to upload a new version and add new approvers or reviewers as needed, ensuring that feedback and approval are specific to the document version and eliminating potential confusion.

* **Audit trails**\
    With New Document Approvals, an audit trail of all approval activities is maintained in the activity stream, providing a valuable resource for future reference and compliance.

## Release plan

We are making New Document Approvals available to users over the course of several releases. In addition to adding new features, we will also expand the number of accounts for which New Document Approvals are available with each release. Account administrators will receive an Announcement Center email informing them of the change prior to being included.

If you would like to have New Document Approvals enabled in you production environment, please reach out to your Customer Success or Strategic Account Manager.
