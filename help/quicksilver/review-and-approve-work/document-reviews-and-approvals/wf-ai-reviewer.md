## Set up brand guidelines

The Workfront AI Reviewer uses the brand guildelines set up in Genstudio for Performance Marketing when reviewing your content. 

To learn more about brand guildelines, see

* [GenStudio for Performance Marketing Brands](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/genstudio-for-performance-marketing/user-guide/guidelines/brands)
* [Add guidelines](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/genstudio-for-performance-marketing/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines)


## Set up AI Reviewers

Once you have at least one brand set up in GenStudio for Peformance Marketing, you can create multiple AI Reviewers, which you can then assign to approval templates and ad-hoc approval workflows. 

For more information, see [Set up AI Reviewers](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/set-up-ai-reviewer.md).

## Add AI reviewers to approval workflows

You can add AI reviewers to a existing approval workflow templates or to an individual review and approval request. 

### Approval Templates

If you often add the same people to approval requests, you can createa an approval template in the Workfront Setup area.  

Now, you can add AI reviewers to approval templates to automaticlly check for brand compliance when a template is used to create a request. 

Once created, Approval Templates can be applied to assets in the Documents area of a project, task, or issue.

For more information, see [Create an Approval Template for assets and documents](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-approval-template.md)

### Individual review and approval request 

If you create individual review and approval requests, you can add AI Reviewers as you create the request. For more information, see [Create a document review or approval request](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-a-document-approval.md)

## View AI Reviewer score and feedback 

Seconds after you submit the approval request, you can view the score and feedback from the AI Reviewer in the Document Summary panel. 

You'll also receive an email notifying you that a review has been completed on the asset. You can click **Go to review** and see the score and feedback in Workfront. 

The AI Reviewer does not produce an approval or rejection. It only provides a score and recommendations to align the asset with the specified brand requiremets. 

if you need to update the image because it does not pass the brand check, you can upload as a new version. 

For more information on viewing scores and feedback, see [View AI Reviewer score and feedbak](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/view-ai-reviewer-feedback.md).
