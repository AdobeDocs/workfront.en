# Get started with the Workfront AI Reviewer

With the Workfront AI Reviewer, you can increase content velocity and optimize brand compliance in the review and approval process. You can add AI Reviewers to approval templates or invdividual approvals in Workfront. 

## Access requirements

To set up AI Reviewers, you must be a system administrator. 

Any user can add the AI Reviewer to a review and approval request.


## Prerequisites 

* Your organization must have migrated to Adobe IMS (Identity Management System)
* Your Workfront instance must have Unified Approvals enabled 
* Adobe must have a signed Adobe Gen AI agreement on file
    For more information on signing the agreement, see [Sign the Adobe Gen AI agreement](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-overview.md#sign-the-adobe-gen-ai-agreement).

* WEBP (.webp)
* Non-animated GIF (.gif)

## Set up brand guidelines

The Workfront AI Reviewer uses the brand guidelines set up in Genstudio for Performance Marketing when reviewing your content. 

To learn more about brand guidelines, see

* [GenStudio for Performance Marketing Brands](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/genstudio-for-performance-marketing/user-guide/guidelines/brands)
* [Add guidelines](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/genstudio-for-performance-marketing/user-guide/guidelines/add-guidelines)


## Create AI Reviewers

Once you have at least one brand set up in GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you can create multiple AI Reviewers, which you can then assign to approval templates and ad-hoc approval workflows. 

For more information, see [Set up AI Reviewers](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/set-up-ai-reviewer.md).

## Add AI Reviewers to approval workflows

You can add AI Reviewers to an existing approval workflow templates or to an individual review and approval request. 

### Approval templates

If you often add the same people to approval requests, you can create an approval template in the Workfront Setup area.  

Now, you can add AI Reviewers to approval templates to automatically check for brand compliance when a template is used to create a request. 

Once created, approval templates can be applied to assets in the Documents area of a project, task, or issue.

For more information, see [Create an Approval Template for assets and documents](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-approval-template.md)

### Individual review and approval request 

If you create individual review and approval requests, you can add AI Reviewers as you create the request. For more information, see [Create a document review or approval request](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-a-document-approval.md)

## View AI Reviewer score and feedback 

Seconds after you submit the approval request, the score and feedback from the AI Reviewer is available in the Document Summary panel. 

Approval owners also receive an email notifying them that a review has been completed on the asset. From the email, click **Go to review** and see the score and feedback in Workfront. 

The AI Reviewer does not produce an approval or rejection. It only provides a score and recommendations to align the asset with the specified brand requirements. 

If the image does long meet brand guildelines, the creative can upload a new version and the approval owner can create a second review and approval request with the AI Reviewer, allowing you to switch between versions and compare feedback.

For more information on viewing scores and feedback, see [View AI Reviewer score and feedback](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/view-ai-reviewer-feedback.md).
