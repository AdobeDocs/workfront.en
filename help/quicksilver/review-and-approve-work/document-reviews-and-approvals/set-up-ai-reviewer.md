customer questions:

Lilly has some questions on this
1- Do brands update directly to GS Brands when updated in WF?
2- Is there a way to block this aspect in WF for users so they have to use brands in GS?

## Add an AI reviewer

1. In the left panel, go to **Review and Approval** > **AI Reviewers**.
1. Click **Add new**.

1. Select a **Brand**.
1. Select a **Category**.

    Once the AI Reviewer is created, users can add the AI Reviewer to approval templates or individual approvals.
