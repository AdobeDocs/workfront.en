# Set up AI Reviewers

Once you have at least one brand set up in GenStudio for Peformance Marketing, you can create multiple AI Reviewers, which you can then assign to approval templates and ad-hoc approval workflows. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The AI Reviewer does not produce an approval or rejection. It only provides a score and recommendations to align the asset with the specified brand requiremets.
