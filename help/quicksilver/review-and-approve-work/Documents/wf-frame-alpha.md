## Beta Release updates in Workfront - Mar. 2024

In this Beta release we have:

### Add a deadline to a document reviews and approvals

You can now specify a deadline for users or teams assigned to review or approve a document. Reviewers and approvers receive email notifications 72 hours and then 24 hours before the specified deadline. The deadline is also reflected in the Approvals widget in the new Home area.

For more information, see [Create a document review or approval request](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-a-document-approval.md).

### Create and use Approval Templates

You can now create Approval Templates in the Setup area to streamline the review and approval process. Approval Templates allow you make the review and approval process more repeatable by 

* Adding reviewers and approvers
* Setting a timeframe

You can apply Approval Templates from the Documents area when creating an approval process for a Document. 

For more information, see [Create an Approval Template](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-approval-template.md).

### View information about all your approvals in once place

To help you manage and analyze your approval requests at a glance, we've added the following key performance indicators to the All Approvals widget:

* Approvals by decision
* Average approval time
* Pending approvals
* Overdue approvals

You can drill down into the categories listed above for a more detailed view. The All Approvals widget is available in New Home and Canvas Dashboards.

For more information, see [Get started with new Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

### Lock your review & approvals once an overall decision is made

To ensure compliance and reduce churn in your content sign-off processes, we will now lock any approval on a file once an overall decision has been made. This includes either Approved, Approved with Changes or Needs Work.

Once locked, any person either reviewing and/or approving will no longer be able to make any comments, replies, decisions or add drawing markups, ensuring, your review process and associated audit stays unchanged. 

When a new document version is uploaded, the next round of revision can be kicked off while keeping previous revisions locked.
