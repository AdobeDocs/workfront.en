# Beta Program –  Workfront + Frame.io

Welcome to the Workfront + Frame.io integration beta program! As a part of this beta, you'll gain early access to our Workfront + Frame.io native integration experience and be able to share your feedback that will ultimately shape the final experience we release to our wider customer base. With this integration, we aim to create a frictionless end-to-end workflow between Workfront and Frame.io with a focus on providing an ideal, unified Review and Approval solution. 

Here you will find information about the latest Beta release along with a brief video walkthrough to get you started.

## Beta Release updates in Frame.io - Mar. 2024

### Add multiple assets from Frame.io to Workfront

You can now add up to 10 assets from Frame.io to Workfront at once. You can choose to add to Workfront Project Documents or to a specific project task.

### Improved experience when adding a Frame.io asset to Workfront

The menu items for adding an asset to Workfront have been updated making it easier to see tasks assigned to you, task hierarchy and task status.

## Beta Release updates in Workfront - Mar. 2024

In this Beta release we have:

### Add a deadline to a document reviews and approvals

You can now specify a deadline for users or teams assigned to review or approve a document. Reviewers and approvers receive email notifications 72 hours and then 24 hours before the specified deadline. The deadline is also reflected in the Approvals widget in the new Home area.

For more information, see [Create a document review or approval request](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-a-document-approval.md).

### Create and use Approval Templates

You can now create Approval Templates in the Setup area to streamline the review and approval process. Approval Templates allow you make the review and approval process more repeatable by 

* Adding reviewers and approvers
* Setting a timeframe

You can apply Approval Templates from the Documents area when creating an approval process for a Document. 

For more information, see [Create an Approval Template](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-approval-template.md).

### View information about all your approvals in once place

To help you manage and analyze your approval requests at a glance, we've added the following key performance indicators to the All Approvals widget:

* Approvals by decision
* Average approval time
* Pending approvals
* Overdue approvals

You can drill down into the categories listed above for a more detailed view. The All Approvals widget is available in New Home and Canvas Dashboards.

For more information, see [Get started with new Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

### Lock your review & approvals once an overall decision is made

To ensure compliance and reduce churn in your content sign-off processes, we will now lock any approval on a file once an overall decision has been made. This includes either Approved, Approved with Changes or Needs Work.

Once locked, any person either reviewing and/or approving will no longer be able to make any comments, replies, decisions or add drawing markups, ensuring, your review process and associated audit stays unchanged. 

When a new document version is uploaded, the next round of revision can be kicked off while keeping previous revisions locked.

## Feature testing

With this integration, our goal is to allow creatives to stay in their tool of choice (CC or Frame.io) to conduct their content creation and peer reviews, while having project managers coordinate the work and initialize and monitor the formal review process from inside Workfront. This can be achieved by utilizing the best of both solutions: Workfront's new document approvals for managing content approvals, in conjunction with the content review capabilities offered by Frame.io. Collectively, the new document approvals and Frame.io are going to form our new end-to-end content review and approval experience. 

To allow you to easily test the new features of the beta program, we've created a new test Frame.io account and connected it to a new group called `Frame.io testing` in your existing Workfront Preview or Sandbox environment.

+++Expand to view basic testing instructions

To test the functionality, please log in to your Workfront Preview or Sandbox instance and perform the following steps: 

1. **Coordinators:** Within Workfront, create a project with the `Frame.io testing` group assigned as the project group. 

1. **Coordinators:** Within Workfront, mark the tasks that require creative work as frame-enabled (in task details) and assign your creatives to it (assign yourself as well if you would like to test the whole workflow). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Subtasks cannot be marked as Frame enabled.
>

1. **Coordinators:** Upload your creative brief and change the project status to "Current".

1. **Creatives:** Check your emails for an invite to the newly created Frame.io project 

1. **Creatives:** Click the "Join project" button within the invitation email to join the Frame.io project, review the creative brief within the project and start your content creation within your Creative Cloud tool of choice. 

1. **Creatives:** Upload your created assets to Frame.io and add them to the linked Workfront project by selecting one of the assigned Frame-enabled tasks. Select the option to mark the task as complete. 

1. **Coordinators:** Within Workfront, find the linked Frame.io assets in the frame-enabled task and check that the task's status was changed to "complete".

1. **Coordinators:** Assign reviewers/approvers to the linked Frame.io asset. Assign yourself as an approver as well if you would like to test the entire workflow. (For more information on assigning reviews/approvers, see [Add additional approvers or reviewers to a document](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/add-additional-reviewers-or-approvers.md)). 

1. **Stakeholders:** Within Workfront, view your approval request in Home, Document Details, or in the received email notification. Open the asset in the Frame.io Viewer, leave a comment containing feedback, and make a decision.

1. **Coordinators:** Within Workfront, view the stakeholder created comments within the Updates section of the Frame.io connected document, as well as the decision within the Approval section or document summary pane.

1. **Creatives:** Within Frame.io, notice the overall approval decision made for your assets. 

1. **Creatives:** Within Frame.io, apply the requested changes by adding the updated version to the version stack of the connected asset. 

1. **Coordinators:** Within Workfront, assign approvers/reviewers to the newly uploaded version and monitor the progress until it reaches sign-off.
