# Beta Program –  Workfront + Frame.io

Welcome to the Workfront + Frame.io integration beta program! As a part of this beta, you'll gain early access to our Workfront + Frame.io native integration experience and be able to share your feedback that will ultimately shape the final experience we release to our wider customer base. With this integration, we aim to create a frictionless end-to-end workflow between Workfront and Frame.io with a focus on providing an ideal, unified Review and Approval solution. 

Here you will find information about the latest Beta release along with a brief video walkthrough to get you started.

This May release includes the following capabilities:

### Workfront projects are automatically synced to Frame.io

Based on your feedback, we've improved the experience and reduced the steps needed to trigger the creation of a connected Frame.io.  Now, when you create a project in Workfront, a corresponding project is automatically created in Frame.io. 

### Improved assignment of creatives to your Frame.io project

You can now easily manage who should have access to the connected Frame.io project. Your creative users can be flagged as "Frame.io enabled" which will automatically grant them access to the connected Frame.io project when assigned to the Workfront project.   

### Frame.io project name gets updated when Workfront project name changes

As part of our efforts to improve the project synchronization between Workfront and Frame.io, Workfront project name updates are now also reflected within Frame.io. 

### Approval status in document list

Easily track the approval status of any file directly from the document list. With a simple click on the overall status, access a detailed breakdown of all participants involved in the approval process, along with their individual statuses. Additionally, streamline your workflow by reminding any outstanding approvers with just one click, ensuring timely responses and efficient document management. 


## March 2024: Beta Release updates in Frame.io

+++ Expand to view the functionality released in March 2024

### Add multiple assets from Frame.io to Workfront

You can now add up to 10 assets from Frame.io to Workfront at once. You can choose to add to Workfront Project Documents or to a specific project task.

### Improved experience when adding a Frame.io asset to Workfront

The menu items for adding an asset to Workfront have been updated making it easier to see tasks assigned to you, task hierarchy and task status.

## March 2024: Beta Release updates in Workfront

In this Beta release we have:

### Add a deadline to a document reviews and approvals

You can now specify a deadline for users or teams assigned to review or approve a document. Reviewers and approvers receive email notifications 72 hours and then 24 hours before the specified deadline. The deadline is also reflected in the Approvals widget in the new Home area.

For more information, see [Create a document review or approval request](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-a-document-approval.md).

### Create and use Approval Templates

You can now create Approval Templates in the Setup area to streamline the review and approval process. Approval Templates allow you make the review and approval process more repeatable by 

* Adding reviewers and approvers
* Setting a timeframe

You can apply Approval Templates from the Documents area when creating an approval process for a Document. 

For more information, see [Create an Approval Template](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/create-approval-template.md).

### View information about all your approvals in once place

To help you manage and analyze your approval requests at a glance, we've added the following key performance indicators to the All Approvals widget:

* Approvals by decision
* Average approval time
* Pending approvals
* Overdue approvals

You can drill down into the categories listed above for a more detailed view. The All Approvals widget is available in New Home and Canvas Dashboards.

For more information, see [Get started with new Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

### Lock your review & approvals once an overall decision is made

To ensure compliance and reduce churn in your content sign-off processes, we will now lock any approval on a file once an overall decision has been made. This includes either Approved, Approved with Changes or Needs Work.

Once locked, any person either reviewing and/or approving will no longer be able to make any comments, replies, decisions or add drawing markups, ensuring, your review process and associated audit stays unchanged. 

When a new document version is uploaded, the next round of revision can be kicked off while keeping previous revisions locked.

## Feature testing

With this integration, our goal is to allow creatives to stay in their tool of choice (CC or Frame.io) to conduct their content creation and peer reviews, while having project managers coordinate the work and initialize and monitor the formal review process from inside Workfront. This can be achieved by utilizing the best of both solutions: Workfront's new document approvals for managing content approvals, in conjunction with the content review capabilities offered by Frame.io. Collectively, the new document approvals and Frame.io are going to form our new end-to-end content review and approval experience. 

To allow you to easily test the new features of the beta program, we've created a new test Frame.io account and connected it to a new group called `Frame.io testing` in your existing Workfront Preview or Sandbox environment.

### Detailed testing instructions

For participants looking to test additional functionality, we've created a more involved test scenario. A guide for this detailed test scenario can be downloaded here: [WF + Frame.io Detailed Test Scenario Walkthrough](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/Documents/assets/WF-Frame-Detailed-Walk-Through-May-Release.pdf).
