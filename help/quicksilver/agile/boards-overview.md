# Boards overview

Adobe Workfront Boards are flexible tools that allow team collaboration by providing access to a shared board that contains columns and cards.

Showing task status is a common use for boards, but you can group any items together. A card on a board can represent a person, group of people, idea, concept, or any type of item that you need.

Using boards, you can:

* Quickly set up a task board
* Configure columns to show a status or category
* Customize workflows with open-ended cards
* Organize and manage work for a team in one place

>[!NOTE]
>
>The ad hoc cards on a board are not connected to work items in Adobe Workfront. For details about connected cards, see [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Boards does not appear in the Main Menu by default. Your Workfront administrator must add Boards to your layout template to make it available in the Main Menu. For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

For information about how to use boards, see [Get started with boards in Adobe Workfront](../agile/get-started-with-boards/get-started-with-boards.md).
