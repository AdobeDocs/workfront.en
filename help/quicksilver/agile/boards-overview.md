# [!UICONTROL Boards] overview

[!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Boards] are flexible tools that allow team collaboration by providing access to a shared board that contains columns and cards.

Showing task status is a common use for boards, but you can group any items together. A card on a board can represent a person, group of people, idea, concept, or any type of item that you need.

Using boards, you can:

* Quickly set up a task board
* Configure columns to show a status or category
* Customize workflows with open-ended cards (either ad hoc cards or cards connected to [!DNL Workfront] tasks and issues)
* Organize and manage work for a team in one place
* Use agile planning tools such as an intake column for Kanban boards
