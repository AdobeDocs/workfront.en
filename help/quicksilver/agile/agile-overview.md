# Agile overview

Agile is a work methodology that allows teams to complete small, manageable amounts of work at a consistent cadence. In agile, teams manage stories on a backlog or story board and not tasks in a project. Adobe Workfront provides tools that help teams work in an agile way.

Workfront boards are simple yet flexible tools for team collaboration. For information on boards, see [Boards overview](../agile/boards-overview.md).

Additional advanced agile team tools use either Kanban or Scrum. For information on the Kanban and Scrum methodologies, see the section [Decide on an agile methodology](../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/create-an-agile-team.md#deciding) in the article [Create an agile team](../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/create-an-agile-team.md).

To begin using advanced agile in Workfront:

1. Create an agile team.

   For information, see the section [Create a new agile team](../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/create-an-agile-team.md#creating-an-agile-team-from-scratch) or [Convert an existing team into an agile team](../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/create-an-agile-team.md#converting-an-existing-team-into-an-agaile-team) in the article [Create an agile team](../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/create-an-agile-team.md).

1. Configure the agile team to use Kanban or Scrum.

   For information, see [Configure Kanban](../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-kanban.md) or [Configure Scrum](../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-scrum.md).

1. Kanban teams: Manage the backlog and build the Kanban board.

   For information, see [Manage the agile backlog](../agile/work-in-an-agile-environment/manage-the-agile-backlog.md) and [Kanban overview](../agile/use-kanban-in-an-agile-team/kanban-overview.md).

1. Scrum teams: Manage the backlog, create an iteration, and build the Scrum board.

   For information, see [Manage the agile backlog](../agile/work-in-an-agile-environment/manage-the-agile-backlog.md), [Iterations overview](../agile/use-scrum-in-an-agile-team/iterations/iterations-overview.md), and [Scrum board overview](../agile/use-scrum-in-an-agile-team/scrum-board/scrum-board-overview.md).

1. Add tasks from projects to the backlog or the story board for the team.

   For information, see [Manage the agile backlog](../agile/work-in-an-agile-environment/manage-the-agile-backlog.md), [Add existing tasks or issues to the Kanban board](../agile/use-kanban-in-an-agile-team/add-existing-tasks-or-issues-to-the-kanban-board.md), and [Add stories to an existing iteration](../agile/use-scrum-in-an-agile-team/iterations/add-stories-to-existing-iteration.md).
