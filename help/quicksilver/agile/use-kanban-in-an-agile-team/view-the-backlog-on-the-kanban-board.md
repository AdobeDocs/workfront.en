# Add the backlog to the Kanban board

You can display a Backlog column directly on your Kanban board. The Backlog column on the Kanban board contains the first 20 items from your backlog on the Kanban board. Tasks and issues must belong to a project with a status that equates with Current to appear on the backlog.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Add the backlog to the Kanban board

By default, the Backlog column is hidden. To display the backlog:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Teams**.

1. (Optional) Click the **Switch team** icon ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png), then either select a new Kanban team from the drop-down menu or search for a team in the search bar.

1. Go to the Kanban board where you want to display the backlog.
1. Click **Show Backlog**.

For more information about the backlog, see [Manage the agile backlog](../../agile/work-in-an-agile-environment/manage-the-agile-backlog.md).
