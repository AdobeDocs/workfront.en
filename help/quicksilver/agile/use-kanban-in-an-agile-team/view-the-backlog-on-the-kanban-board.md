# Add the backlog to the Kanban board

You can display a [!UICONTROL Backlog] column directly on your Kanban board. The [!UICONTROL Backlog] column on the [!DNL Kanban] board contains the first 20 items from your backlog on the [!DNL Kanban] board. Tasks and issues must belong to a project with a status that equates with Current to appear on the backlog.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront plan*]</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Add the backlog to the Kanban board

By default, the [!UICONTROL Backlog] column is hidden. To display the backlog:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe] Workfront, then click **Teams**.

1. (Optional) Click the **Switch team** icon ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png), then either select a new Kanban team from the drop-down menu or search for a team in the search bar.

1. Go to the Kanban board where you want to display the backlog.
1. Click **Show Backlog**.
>[!NOTE]
>
>If you add multiple teams to a backlog item, the task or issue displays only on the primary team's backlog. The primary team is the team first assigned.

For more information about the backlog, see [Manage the agile backlog](../../agile/work-in-an-agile-environment/manage-the-agile-backlog.md).
