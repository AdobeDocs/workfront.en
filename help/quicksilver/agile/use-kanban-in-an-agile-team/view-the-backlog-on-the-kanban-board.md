## Add the backlog to the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board

By default, the [!UICONTROL Backlog] column is hidden. To display the backlog:

{{step1-to-team}}

1. (Optional) Click the **[!UICONTROL Switch team]** icon ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png), then either select a new [!UICONTROL Kanban] team from the drop-down menu or search for a team in the search bar.

1. Go to the Kanban board where you want to display the backlog.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Show Backlog]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you add multiple teams to a backlog item, the task or issue displays only on the primary team's backlog. The primary team is the team first assigned.

For more information about the backlog, see [Manage the agile backlog](../../agile/work-in-an-agile-environment/manage-the-agile-backlog.md).
