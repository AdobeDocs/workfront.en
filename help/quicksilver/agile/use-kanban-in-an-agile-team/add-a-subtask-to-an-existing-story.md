# Add a subtask to an existing story on the Kanban board

When creating subtasks for existing stories, keep in mind the following:

**When the Summary Completion Mode setting for the project is set to Manual:**

* You can move a parent story with subtasks to Complete updates the parent story to 100% and the Status to Complete. Subtasks are not updated.
* To update the Percent Complete for the story, you must update it from the Stories tab or from the Details page of the object.

**When the Summary Completion Mode setting for the project is set to Automatic:**

* You can't move the parent story across the board. To update the Percent Complete for the story, you must update the Percent Complete for any subtasks. The Percent Complete for the story is calculated based on the Percent Complete of all subtasks.
* Moving a parent story with subtasks to Complete updates the parent story to 100% and the Status to Complete. Subtasks are also updated to 100% and the Status is updated to Complete.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Object permissions</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Contribute or Manage access to the task the subtask is on</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
