# Add a subtask to an existing story on the Kanban board

When creating subtasks for existing stories, keep in mind the following:

**When the [!UICONTROL Summary Completion Mode] setting for the project is set to [!UICONTROL Manual]:**

* You can move a parent story with subtasks to [!UICONTROL Complete], which updates the parent story to 100% and the [!UICONTROL Status] to [!UICONTROL Complete]. Subtasks are not updated.
* To update the [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] for the story, you must update it from the [!UICONTROL Stories] tab or from the [!UICONTROL Details] page of the object.

**When the [!UICONTROL Summary Completion Mode] setting for the project is set to [!UICONTROL Automatic]:**

* You can't move the parent story across the board. To update the [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] for the story, you must update the [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] for any subtasks. The [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] for the story is calculated based on the [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] of all subtasks.
* Moving a parent story with subtasks to [!UICONTROL Complete] updates the parent story to 100% and the [!UICONTROL Status] to [!UICONTROL Complete]. Subtasks are also updated to 100% and the [!UICONTROL Status] is updated to [!UICONTROL Complete].
