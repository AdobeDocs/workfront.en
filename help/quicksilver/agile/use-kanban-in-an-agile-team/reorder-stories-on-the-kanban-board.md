# Reorder stories on the Kanban board

You might want to change the order in which stories are displayed within status columns on the Kanban board.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot change the order in which stories are displayed on the backlog for a Kanban team.

The order in which stories appear on the Kanban board does not indicate priority. However, it can affect the perceived priority by making stories more visible.

By default, stories are displayed in alphabetical order within each [!UICONTROL status] column on the Kanban board.

When you reorder columns on the [!DNL Kanban] board, any changes you make are saved, so changes are retained the next time you or another user views the Kanban board. (Changes you make are not reverted when clearing the browser cache.)

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.
