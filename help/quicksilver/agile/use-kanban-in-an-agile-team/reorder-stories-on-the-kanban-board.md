# Reorder stories on the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board

You might want to change the order in which stories are displayed within status columns on the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot change the order in which stories are displayed on the backlog for a [!UICONTROL Kanban] team.

The order in which stories appear on the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board does not indicate priority. However, it can affect the perceived priority by making stories more visible.

By default, stories are displayed in alphabetical order within each status column on the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board.

When you reorder columns on the [!DNL Kanban] board, any changes you make are saved, so changes are retained the next time you or another user views the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board. (Changes you make are not reverted when clearing the browser cache.)
