# Update the status of stories on the Kanban board

You can change the status of a story directly from the Kanban&nbsp;board in order to reflect how the stories are progressing.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only statuses selected in the Story Board section in the team settings area are available on the Kanban board and in the status drop-down menu. For more information, see [Configure Kanban](../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-kanban.md)

  </tr>
