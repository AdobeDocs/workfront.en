# Add existing tasks or issues to the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board

You can add any task or issue to a [!UICONTROL Kanban] board if you have Manage access to the project. Keep the following in mind when moving a task or issue to a [!UICONTROL Kanban] board:

* If the task or issue is assigned to an agile team and moved to another team's [!UICONTROL Kanban] board, the team assignment does not change.
* If the task or issue is not assigned to a team, the task or issue is assigned to the team who owns the Kanban board.
