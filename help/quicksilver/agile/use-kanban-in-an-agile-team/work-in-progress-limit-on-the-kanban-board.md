# Manage the [!UICONTROL work in progress] (WIP) limit on the Kanban board

You can configure a [!UICONTROL Work In Progress] (WIP) limit for each column on the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board, as described in the article [Configure Kanban](../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-kanban.md).

The WIP limit is simply a visual warning and does not restrict your team from having more items in each status column than the limit you set.

## View the [!UICONTROL Work In Progress] (WIP) limit on the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board

When a WIP limit is configured for your agile team, it is displayed in the upper-right corner of each column on the Kanban board (except for the [!UICONTROL Complete] column).

Any time the limit is exceeded for any column on the [!UICONTROL Kanban] board, the limit is highlighted in red and a message is displayed.
