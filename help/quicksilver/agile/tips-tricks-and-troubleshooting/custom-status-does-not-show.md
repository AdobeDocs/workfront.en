# Custom statuses not showing up on the agile story board

If you want to use a custom status on an agile story board, your Adobe Workfront administrator must first create that custom status as a system-wide status. For more information, have your Workfront administrator see [Create or edit a status](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).
