# Customize which fields are displayed on a card

{{highlighted-preview-article-level}}

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards.

By default, all available fields are displayed on a card, both in the the full view when the card is open, and in the condensed card view on the board. You can customize which fields are displayed by:

* Disabling a field so it is not displayed in either view
* Hiding a field on the condensed card view

If a field contains a value and you disable the field, the value is retained if you enable the field again later.

>[!NOTE]

>Any field customizations you make only apply to the board you are working in.
