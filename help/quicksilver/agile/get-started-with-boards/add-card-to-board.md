# Add a card to a board

The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

You can quickly add a card to a board and assign it to a board member. The card can represent a task, issue, person, group, or any type of item that you want to include on the board.

Using a checklist on a card allows you to break down work into smaller increments or add notes to the card.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The cards on a board are not connected to work items in Adobe Workfront.
