# Manage board columns

The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

A new board contains the default columns New, In Progress, and Complete. You can add more columns, change the order of the columns, rename columns, and delete any columns that you donâ€™t need.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
