# Use the boards dashboard

The boards dashboard shows the list of boards and collections that you have access to, including boards you have created and boards that you have been added to. Individual boards you have access to that are not part of a collection are displayed first.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Collections are available only through the early feature opt-in for [!DNL Workfront] [!UICONTROL Boards].

On the dashboard you can do the following for boards and collections:

* Archive a board (collections can't be archived)
* Filter the boards list
* Sort the boards list by board name or date modified
* Search for a board or collection
* Delete a board or collection

For information about creating a new board or editing an existing board, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md). For information about creating a new collection, see [Manage collections](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/manage-collections.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Request] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Filter boards {#filter-boards}

You can filter the boards dashboard to show active boards, archived boards, or all boards.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click [!UICONTROL **Filter**] and select **[!UICONTROL All]**, **[!UICONTROL Active boards]**, or **[!UICONTROL Archived boards]**.

   When a filter other than the default is applied on the dashboard, an indicator is displayed on the filter icon ![[!UICONTROL Filter applied to] dashboard](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png).

## Sort boards

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. To sort the list of boards, click [!UICONTROL **Sort**]. The default sort option for the page is by **[!UICONTROL Date modified]**. You can also sort the page by board **[!UICONTROL Name]**.

   Select **[!UICONTROL Reverse order]** to sort the boards in reverse order of date modified or name. When the arrow on the sort icon points up, reverse order is applied. When the arrow points down, the standard order is applied.

   When a sort other than the default is applied on the dashboard, an indicator is displayed on the sort icon ![Sort applied](assets/sort-applied-boards.png).

## Search for a board or a collection

You can search in the Boards area for a specific board, or search in the Collections area for a specific collection.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click [!UICONTROL **Search**] and type a search term. Then, press Enter.

   All boards that contain the search term in the title are displayed.

   Click the X to clear the search.

## Archive a board

Archiving a board sends it to the archive and you can restore it later.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you archive a board, it is archived for all of the board members.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board, and select **[!UICONTROL Archive]**.

   An [!UICONTROL Archive] icon ![Archive](assets/archive-icon-spectrum-25x20.png) appears on the board. You can't edit an archived board.

   Archived boards are hidden on the boards dashboard unless you apply a filter to display them. For more information, see the [[!UICONTROL Filter boards]](#filter-boards) section in this article.

1. To restore an archived board, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu icon](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board and select **[!UICONTROL Restore]**.

## Delete a board or a collection

When you delete a board, it is permanently removed from [!DNL Workfront] and can't be restored. Any cards on the board are also deleted along with the board.

Deleting a collection deletes all of the boards in the collection.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can only delete boards and collections that you created, not boards and collections that you were added to.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![[!UICONTROL More menu]](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board or collection, and select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

   On a collection, the menu is on the right, next to the [!UICONTROL **View collection**] button.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete board]** or [!UICONTROL **Delete collection**] on the confirmation message.

## Move a board to a collection

You can move a standalone board into a collection, or move a board from one collection to another collection.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can only move boards that you created, not boards that you were added to.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![[!UICONTROL More menu]](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board, and select [!UICONTROL **Move to collection**].
1. Select which collection to add the board to, and click [!UICONTROL **Move**].

   The board is moved into the collection and no longer appears in the [!UICONTROL Boards] area.
   If you have not created a collection yet, you are prompted to create one to move the board into.
