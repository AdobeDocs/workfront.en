# Use the boards dashboard

The boards dashboard shows the list of boards that you have access to, including boards you have created and boards that you have been added to.

On the boards dashboard you can archive a board, filter the list of boards, sort the list by board name or date modified, and search for a specific board. You can also archive an individual board or delete it. For information about creating a new board or editing an existing board, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[!UICONTROL Boards] does not appear in the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] by default. Your [!DNL Workfront] administrator must add [!UICONTROL Boards] to your layout template to make it available in the [!UICONTROL Main Menu]. For information, see [Customize the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Request] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Filter boards {#filter-boards}

You can filter the boards dashboard to show active boards, archived boards, or all boards.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the filter icon ![Filter](assets/filter-icon-spectrum-25x25.png) and select **[!UICONTROL All]**, **[!UICONTROL Active boards]**, or **[!UICONTROL Archived boards]**.

   When a filter other than the default is applied on the dashboard, an indicator is displayed on the filter icon ![[!UICONTROL Filter applied to] dashboard](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png).

## Sort boards

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. To sort the list of boards, click the sort icon ![Sort icon](assets/sort-boards-icon.png). The default sort option for the page is by **[!UICONTROL Date modified]**. You can also sort the page by board **[!UICONTROL Name]**.

   Select **[!UICONTROL Reverse order]** to sort the boards in reverse order of date modified or name. When the arrow on the sort icon points up, reverse order is applied. When the arrow points down, the standard order is applied.

   When a sort other than the default is applied on the dashboard, an indicator is displayed on the sort icon ![Sort applied](assets/sort-applied-boards.png).

## Search for a board

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the search icon ![Search icon](assets/search-icon.png) and type a search term. Then, press Enter.

   All boards that contain the search term in the title are displayed.

## Archive a board

Archiving a board sends it to the archive and you can restore it later.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you archive a board, it is archived for all of the board members.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board, and select **[!UICONTROL Archive]**.

   An [!UICONTROL Archive] icon ![Archive](assets/archive-icon-spectrum-25x20.png) appears on the board. You can't edit an archived board.

   Archived boards are hidden on the boards dashboard unless you apply a filter to display them. For more information, see the [[!UICONTROL Filter boards]](#filter-boards) section in this article.

1. To restore an archived board, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu icon](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board and select **[!UICONTROL Restore]**.

## Delete a board

When you delete a board, it is permanently removed from [!DNL Workfront] and can't be restored. Any cards on the board are also deleted along with the board.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can only delete boards that you created, not boards that you were added to.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![[!UICONTROL More menu]](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board, and select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
