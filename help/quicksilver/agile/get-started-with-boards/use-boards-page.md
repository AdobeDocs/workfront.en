# Use the boards dashboard

<!-- Audited: 1/2024 -->

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Workstreams are only available to a specific group of customers.

The boards dashboard shows the list of boards and workstreams that you have access to, including boards you have created and boards that you have been added to. Individual boards you have access to that are not part of a workstream are displayed first.

On the dashboard you can do the following for boards and workstreams:

* Archive a board or workstream
* Filter the boards and workstreams
* Sort the boards list by board name or date modified
* Search for a board or workstream
* Delete a board or workstream

For information about creating a new board or editing an existing board, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md). For information about creating a new workstream, see [Manage workstreams](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/manage-collections.md).

## Filter boards and workstreams {#filter-boards}

You can filter the boards dashboard to show active, archived, or all boards or workstreams.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click [!UICONTROL **Filter**] in the Boards area or the Workstreams area, and select **[!UICONTROL All]**, **[!UICONTROL Active]**, or **[!UICONTROL Archived]**.

   When a filter other than the default is applied on the dashboard, an indicator is displayed on the filter icon ![Filter applied to dashboard](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png).

## Sort boards

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. To sort the list of boards, click [!UICONTROL **Sort**]. The default sort option for the page is by **[!UICONTROL Date modified]**. You can also sort the page by board **[!UICONTROL Name]**.

   Select **[!UICONTROL Reverse order]** to sort the boards in reverse order of date modified or name. When the arrow on the sort icon points up, reverse order is applied. When the arrow points down, the standard order is applied.

   When a sort other than the default is applied on the dashboard, an indicator is displayed on the sort icon ![Sort applied](assets/sort-applied-boards.png).

## Search for a board or a workstream

You can search in the Boards area for a specific board, or search in the Workstreams area for a specific workstream.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.

## Archive a board or a workstream

Archiving a board or a workstream sends it to the archive and you can restore it later.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you archive a board, it is archived for all of the board members.
>
>When you archive a workstream, all of its boards are archived.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board or workstream, and select **[!UICONTROL Archive]**.

    On a workstream, the menu is on the right, next to the [!UICONTROL **View workstream**] button.

   An [!UICONTROL Archive] icon ![Archive](assets/archive-icon-spectrum-25x20.png) appears on the board or workstream. You can't edit an archived board or workstream.

   Archived items are hidden on the boards dashboard unless you apply a filter to display them. For more information, see the [[!UICONTROL Filter boards]](#filter-boards) section in this article.

1. To restore an archived board or workstream, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu icon](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board or workstream and select **[!UICONTROL Restore]**.

## Delete a board or a workstream

When you delete a board, it is permanently removed from [!DNL Workfront] and can't be restored. Any cards on the board are also deleted along with the board.

Deleting a workstream also deletes all of the boards in the workstream.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can only delete boards and workstreams that you created, not boards and workstreams that you were added to.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![[!UICONTROL More menu]](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the board or workstream, and select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

   On a workstream, the menu is on the right, next to the [!UICONTROL **View workstream**] button.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete board]** or [!UICONTROL **Delete workstream**] on the confirmation message.

<!-- ## Move a board to a workstream

You can move a standalone board into a workstream, or move a board from one workstream to another workstream.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can only move boards that you created, not boards that you were added to.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.

   The board is moved into the workstream and no longer appears in the [!UICONTROL Boards] area.
   If you have not created a workstream yet, you are prompted to create one to move the board into.
