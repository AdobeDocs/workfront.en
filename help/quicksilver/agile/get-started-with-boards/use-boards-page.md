# Use the boards dashboard

The boards dashboard shows the list of boards that you have access to, including boards you have created and boards that you have been added to.

On the boards dashboard you can archive a board, filter the list of boards, sort the list by board name or date modified, and search for a specific board. You can also archive an individual board or delete it. For information about creating a new board or editing an existing board, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Boards does not appear in the Main Menu by default. Your Workfront administrator must add Boards to your layout template to make it available in the Main Menu. For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Filter boards {#filter-boards}

## Sort boards
