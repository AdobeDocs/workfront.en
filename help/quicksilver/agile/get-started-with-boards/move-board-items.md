# Manage cards

You can move a card to any column on the board, or copy a card.

If you have column policies enabled for updating field values, the status, assignees, and tags could be updated automatically when you move a card from one column to another. For more information, see "Define column settings and policies" in the article [Manage board columns](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/manage-board-columns.md).

>You can't move a card from one board to another board.
