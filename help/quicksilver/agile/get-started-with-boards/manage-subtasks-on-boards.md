# Manage subtasks on boards

Using subtasks on cards allows you to establish a parent-child relationship between tasks and create a hierarchy of work. A subtask you add to a card on a Workfront board is also added to the task in the Workfront project. For more information on subtasks and tasks at the project level, see [Create subtasks](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-subtasks.md).

Subtasks are only available on connected cards, and they are not available on issues. For information on connected cards, see [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).

## Add a subtask to a card

{{step1-to-boards}}

1. Access a board. For information, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).

   Or

   Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the card, and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

   Any existing subtasks for this task appear on the card in the Subtask section, above the checklist items. Click the [!UICONTROL **Search**] icon to search for a subtask.

1. To add a new subtask, click [!UICONTROL **Add Subtask**]. Then, type the title of the subtask and press Enter.

   The counter at the top of the list shows the number of completed subtasks and the total number of subtasks.

1. Click ![Details icon](assets/checklist-chevron.png) to open the subtask details box. The name of the subtask appears at the top.
1. (Optional) Add the subtask details.

   This information is also added to the subtask in the [!DNL Workfront] project.

   All fields for a connected card are available on the subtask details, including additional subtasks. For information about any of these fields, see [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Close]** to return to the card details and the full list of subtasks.

   You can also use the breadcrumbs at the top of the subtask details to navigate in the hierarchy.

   The assignees and due date appear on the subtask in the list.

1. To copy a subtask, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the item and select **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.
