# Add or remove members from a board

People and teams must be added to the board as members before they can view the board and be assigned to cards.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Request] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Add members to a board

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe] Workfront, then click **[!UICONTROL Boards]**.
1. Create a new board or edit an existing board. For information, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add member]** icon ![Add members](assets/boards-addmember-spectrum-25x25.png).
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Add members]** box, start typing a name, then select it when it displays in the list.

   You can select an individual member or a team. If you choose a team, the team itself is added to the board. The full team and its individual team members are then available to assign to a card.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >An individual user must have the **[!UICONTROL View]** or **[!UICONTROL Edit]** option set in their access level for teams, or they will not be able to view the board.

   When you delete a member from a board, they are also deleted from any cards they were assigned to. For connected cards, the assignments are also updated on the [!DNL Workfront] task or issue.

   Members are only removed from this board. They are not removed from other boards they belong to.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can't remove the board owner.
