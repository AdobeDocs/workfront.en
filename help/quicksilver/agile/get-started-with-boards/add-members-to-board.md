   When you remove a member from a board, they are not removed from any cards they are assigned to. For connected cards, the assignments are also updated on the [!DNL Workfront] task or issue.

   Members are only removed from this board. They are not removed from other boards they belong to.

   >[!NOTE]

   >You can't remove the board owner.
