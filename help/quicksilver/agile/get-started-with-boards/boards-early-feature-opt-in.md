## Early feature opt-in FAQ

### How do I know if my organization has opted in to early features?

When your Workfront administrator has has enabled early features for boards, you will see an Public beta access enabled button on the top of the dashboard screen. Click the button to see which features are enabled with the current version of the beta.

### Can early features be enabled only for certain users?

When the Workfront administrator enables early features for boards, all users in the organization are opted in.

However, the Workfront administrator can hide the Boards option from the Main Menu for individual users or groups of users with a layout template. For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This does not stop users from accessing boards using a URL. It only prevents them from seeing the Boards option in the Main Menu.

### Can I opt out of the early features once I've joined?

Only Workfront administrators can opt out of receiving early features. If a Workfront administrator disables the beta, all users in the organization are opted out.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Boards**.
1. Click **Early feature opt-in enabled** at the top of the dashboard screen.
