# Delete or archive a board

You can delete or archive a board in [!DNL Workfront]. Deleting a board permanently removes it from [!DNL Workfront], while archiving a board retains all cards and allows it to be restored at a later time. These options apply both to standalone boards and boards that are part of workstreams.

>The previous version of workstreams, called collections, are available only through the early feature opt-in for [!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront] Boards]. For details, see [Early feature opt-in for Adobe Workfront Boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/boards-early-feature-opt-in.md).
>Workstreams are available to everyone in the Preview environment.
