# Boards email notifications and preferences

[!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Boards] sends you an email when you are added to a board and when a card is assigned to you. The notifications are turned on by default and you can select in your Boards preferences which emails you want to receive.

You will also receive an email when you are tagged in a comment on a connected card, depending on your email notification settings. For more information, see [Modify your own email notifications](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md). At this time, users tagged in comments on ad hoc cards do not receive an email notification.
