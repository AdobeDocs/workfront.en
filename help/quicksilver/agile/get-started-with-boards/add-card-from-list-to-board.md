## Add existing tasks or issues to a board or a workstream from a list

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront].
1. Choose one of the following: **[!UICONTROL Projects]**, **[!UICONTROL Reporting]**, or **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]**.
1. Go to the project, report, or dashboard that contains the task or issue you want to add to the board or workstream.
1. Select one or more tasks or issues.

   If you select a subtask, it will also be added as a card on the board.

1. Click [!UICONTROL **More**] > [!UICONTROL **Add to Boards**] or [!UICONTROL **Add to Workstreams**].
1. In the [!UICONTROL Add To] dialog box, select the board or workstream to add the items to.

   For a board, only standalone boards are available, not boards that are part of workstreams.

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Add**].
   
   For a board: The task or issue is added to the board as a card. If the board has column policies applied for status, the card is added in the column corresponding to its status. Otherwise, it appears in the first column on the left, not including the intake column.

   For information on column policies, see [Manage board columns](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/manage-board-columns.md).

   For a workstream: The task or issue is added to the workstream's card list as an unplanned card.
