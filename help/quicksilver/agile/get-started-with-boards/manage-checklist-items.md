# Manage checklist items on cards

{{highlighted-preview}}

Using a checklist on a card allows you to break down work into smaller increments or add notes to the card. Checklist items are available on both ad hoc and connected cards.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you create a checklist item on a connected card, a subtask is added to the connected Workfront task. Checklist items on issues are not connected to any Workfront objects.

For information on cards, see [Add an ad hoc card to a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/add-card-to-board.md), [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md), and [Manage cards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/move-board-items.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td>
