# Filter and search in a board

You can filter a board to only display:

* Cards assigned to certain people
* Cards with certain tags
* Cards with a specific status
* Cards due in a certain time frame
* Archived cards

When filters are applied on the board, an indicator is displayed on the filter icon ![Filter applied to board](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png). The indicator also appears in a section with applied filters, and the number at the top of the filter shows the total number of selected filters. Click **Clear All** to remove all filters from the board.

Searching also helps you locate a specific card on the board.
