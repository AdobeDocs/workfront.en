# Filter in a board

The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

You can filter a board to only display cards assigned to certain people. You can also choose to display archived cards in the filter.

<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> Searching also helps you locate a specific card on the board.</p>
-->

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td>
