# Filter and search in a board

You can filter a board to display:

* Cards assigned to certain people
* Cards with certain tags
* Cards with a specific status
* Cards due in a certain time frame
* Archived cards
* Cards connected to a specific project

Sorting the board sorts all of the cards in the columns. You can't sort a single column, and the backlog or intake column is not sorted.

Searching also helps you locate a specific card on the board.

When filters are applied, an indicator is displayed on the board ![Filter applied to board](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png). Click **[!UICONTROL Clear All]** to remove all filters from the board, and click the collapse icon to close the filter panel.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!UICONTROL Archived Cards] section is not available in the filter if you have not turned on the configuration setting to display archived cards. For more information, see [Customize which fields are displayed on a card](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/customize-fields-on-card.md).

## Filter a board by connection

1. Access the board.

   You can also display cards that are not connected to a project.

## Sort on a board

When you select an option to sort by, all columns are sorted. You can't sort a single column, and the backlog or intake column is not sorted.

1. Access the board.
1. Click [!UICONTROL **Sort by**] and select [!UICONTROL **Name**], [!UICONTROL **Due date**], [!UICONTROL **Estimation**], [!UICONTROL **Status**], or [!UICONTROL **Connection**].

   Connection (project name) applies to connected cards only, and the other options will sort both connected and ad hoc cards in the columns.

   The "user order" option returns the cards to the order they were manually set, before any other sort options were applied. This is the default sort for the columns.

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Reverse order**] to sort the columns in reverse order of the sort option.

   The arrow on the sort icon indicates whether the columns are sorted in ascending or descending order.

   When a sort other than the default is applied, an indicator is displayed on the sort icon ![Sort applied](assets/sort-applied-boards.png).

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Search**] and type a search term. Then, press Enter.

   All cards that contain the search term are displayed.

   Click the X to clear the search.
