# Filter and search in a board

You can filter a board to display:

* Cards assigned to certain people
* Cards with certain tags
* Cards with a specific status
* Cards due in a certain time frame
* Archived cards
* Cards connected to a specific project

Searching also helps you locate a specific card on the board.

When filters are applied, an indicator is displayed on the board ![Filter applied to board](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png). Click **[!UICONTROL Clear All]** to remove all filters from the board, and click **[!UICONTROL Hide filters]** to close the filter panel.
