# Filter and search in a board

You can filter a board to only display cards assigned to certain people. You can also choose to display archived or tagged cards in the filter. When filters are applied on the board, an indicator is displayed on the filter icon ![Filter applied to board](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png).

Searching also helps you locate a specific card on the board.

## Access requirements
