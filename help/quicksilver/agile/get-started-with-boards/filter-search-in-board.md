# Filter and search in a board

You can filter a board to display:

* Cards assigned to certain people
* Cards with certain tags
* Cards with a specific status
* Cards due in a certain time frame
* Archived cards

Searching also helps you locate a specific card on the board.

When the early feature opt-in is not used:

When filters are applied on the board, an indicator is displayed on the filter icon ![Filter applied to board](assets/boards-filterapplied-30x30.png). The indicator also appears in a section with applied filters, and the number at the top of the filter shows the total number of selected filters. Click **Clear All** to remove all filters from the board.

When the early feature opt-in is in use:

Click the filter icon ![Filter](assets/filter-icon-spectrum-25x25.png) to open the filter panel on the left of the board. You can expand each filter type to see which filters are applied. Click **Hide filters** to close the filter panel.
