   1. In the left panel, select **Iterations**.

   <table style="table-layout:auto">
    <col>
    <col>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Story Name</strong></td>
      <td>Type a name for the story.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Description</strong></td>
      <td>Type a description for the story.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Ready</strong></td>
      <td>Select this option if the story is ready to be added to an iteration. When this option is selected, it indicates&nbsp;to users which stories in the backlog are ready to be added to an iteration.<br>A story can be added to an iteration whether or not it is marked <strong>Ready.</strong></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Estimate (points)</strong></td>
      <td>Specify the estimate for the story. If your&nbsp;agile team is configured to estimate stories in points, then by default 1 point equals 8 hours. Estimates are added as Planned Hours on the story.<br>For example, if you estimate a story as 3 points, the default behavior is to add 24 Planned Hours&nbsp;to the story.<br>If a story contains subtasks, remember that the combined&nbsp;estimates for all subtasks determines the estimate of&nbsp;the parent story.
