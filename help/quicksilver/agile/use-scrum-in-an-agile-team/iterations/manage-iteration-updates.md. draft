    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Notify</strong></td>

     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Private to my company</strong></td> 
      <td> <p>Disable this option to prevent users outside your company from having access to view this update.</p> 
      <p><b>NOTE</b></p>
      <p>This option displays only when your Workfront user profile is associated with a Company.</p>
      <p>This option is not available in all areas where you can add updates from. For example, this is not available in third-party applications where you can add updates from. </p>
      </td>
