# Change the order of stories on the [!UICONTROL Scrum] board

The order in which stories appear on the story board does not indicate priority. However, it can affect the perceived priority by making stories more visible. By default, stories are displayed in alphabetical order within each status column on the story board. (Stories with swimlanes are displayed at the top of the story board, and stories without swimlanes are displayed separately below any swimlanes.)

When you reorder columns on the story board, any changes you make are saved on the iteration or project, so changes are retained the next time you or another user views the story board. (Changes you make are not reverted when clearing the browser cache.)

## Change story order in an iteration

{{step1-to-team}}

1. (Optional) Click the **[!UICONTROL Switch team]** icon ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png), then either select a new Scrum team from the drop-down menu or search for a team in the search bar.

1. Go to the iteration or project that contains the stories that you want to reorder.
1. Drag a story card or a swimlane to the desired vertical location within a status column on the story board.

## Change story order in a project

Unlike agile iterations, you cannot change story order when viewing a project in an agile view. To modify story order for a project, you must view the project in a standard view.

For information about how to change the project view, see [[!UICONTROL Manage a project] in the [!UICONTROL Agile] View](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/manage-projects-in-agile-view.md). Instead of selecting an agile view, select a standard view.
