# Manage stories and issues on the Scrum board

You can move a story or issue from the Scrum board to another iteration or to the backlog, or delete it from the Scrum board. When you delete a story or issue, it is moved to the Recycle Bin for 30 days and can be recovered only by the system administrator.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level.
