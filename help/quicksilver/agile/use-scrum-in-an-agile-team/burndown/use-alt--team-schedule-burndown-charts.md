# Use an alternate team schedule for burndown charts

Schedules that are defined in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] affect the burndown chart by excluding days off (weekends and holidays) from the burndown.

By default, the burndown chart uses the default schedule. In addition to the default schedule, agile teams can choose to also use an alternate schedule in order to incorporate team-specific non-working days. This alternate schedule is then reflected in the burndown chart of any iteration that is assigned to the team. The alternate schedule affects only the burndown chart. (For more information about the default schedule, as well as how the [!DNL Workfront] administrator can create a team-specific schedule, see [Create a schedule](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md).)

The burndown chart does not take partial days into consideration. For example, if your team works 4 hours each Friday, it's represented as a full day in the burndown chart.

For more information about using the burndown chart, see the [Agile burndown chart overview](../../../agile/use-scrum-in-an-agile-team/burndown/burndown-chart-overview.md).
