# Use an alternate team schedule for burndown charts

Schedules that are defined in Adobe Workfront affect the burndown&nbsp;chart&nbsp;by excluding days off (weekends and holidays) from the burndown.

By default, the burndown chart&nbsp;uses the default schedule.&nbsp;In addition to the default schedule, agile teams can choose to also use an alternate schedule in order to incorporate team-specific non-working days. This alternate schedule is then&nbsp;reflected in the burndown&nbsp;chart of any iteration that is assigned to the team. The alternate schedule affects only the burndown&nbsp;chart.&nbsp;(For more information about the default schedule, as well as how the Workfront administrator can create a team-specific schedule, see&nbsp; [Create a schedule](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md).)

The burndown chart does not take partial days into consideration. For example, if your team works&nbsp;4 hours each Friday, itâ€™s represented as a full day in the burndown chart.

For more information about using the burndown chart, see the [Agile burndown chart overview](../../../agile/use-scrum-in-an-agile-team/burndown/burndown-chart-overview.md).
