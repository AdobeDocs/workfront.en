# Manage collections

{{highlighted-preview-article-level}}

A collection is a configurable group of boards for collaborating on work. Collections can include different types of boards created from templates.

Collections appear on the dashboard along with individual boards you have access to that are not part of a collection. For information about the boards dashboard, see [Use the boards dashboard](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/use-boards-page.md). You can click any board name on the dashboard to open it.

>Collections are available only through the early feature opt-in for [!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront] Boards].

## Add members to a collection

People and teams must be added to the collection as members before they can view the collection and its contents. A collection member can add and remove members on the collection and see which boards are in the collection.
