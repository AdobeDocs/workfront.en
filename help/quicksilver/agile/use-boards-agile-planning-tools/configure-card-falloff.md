# Configure card falloff

{{highlighted-preview-article-level}}

You can configure a board so that cards are removed, or "fall off" the board, on a schedule. You can set cards in a particular column to fall off the board in a certain number of days or weeks.

Cards removed from the board are not deleted from Workfront. You can add them back to the board manually or use the intake column. For information on the intake column, see [Add an intake column to a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/add-intake-column-to-board.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Card falloff is available only via the early feature opt-in. For details, see [Early feature opt-in for Adobe Workfront Boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/boards-early-feature-opt-in.md).
