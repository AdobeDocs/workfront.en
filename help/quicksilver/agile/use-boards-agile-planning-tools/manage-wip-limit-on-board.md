# Manage the Work in Progress (WIP) limit on a board

You can configure a Work In Progress (WIP) limit for each column on a board.

The WIP limit is simply a visual warning and does not restrict you from having more items in each column than the limit you set.

>[!NOTE]
>
>WIP limits are available only via the early feature opt-in. For details, see [Early feature opt-in for Adobe Workfront Boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/boards-early-feature-opt-in.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
