# Create an iteration in a workstream

{{highlighted-preview-article-level}}

An iteration is a set amount of time reserved for completing work. Some agile teams may refer to an iteration as a sprint.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Request] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Create an iteration in a workstream

{{step1-to-boards}}

1. Open the workstream where you want to add the iteration. To open a workstream, click [!UICONTROL **View workstream**].
1. Create an iteration using one of these methods:

   * On the Card List tab, in the iteration view, click [!UICONTROL **Create iteration**].
   * On the Card List tab, in the list view, click [!UICONTROL **Create iteration**].
   * On the Boards tab, click [!UICONTROL **Add board**] and select [!UICONTROL **Iteration Process**] as the board template. Then, open the iteration board and click [!UICONTROL **Configure iterations**].

1. In the Iteration Details dialog, add the following information:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td><strong>[!UICONTROL Iteration name]</strong></td> 
      <td>The name of the iteration, such as "Sprint 1."</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td><strong>[!UICONTROL Iteration length]</strong></td> 
      <td>The length of the iteration, in days, weeks, or months.</td> 
     </tr>
     <tr> 
      <td><strong>[!UICONTROL Start date]</strong></td> 
      <td>The date the iteration begins. The end date is automatically entered based on the iteration length.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Save**].

   The iteration now appears in the iteration view of the card list, and in the metrics area on the iteration board.

   To add cards to an iteration, see [Use the card list](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/use-card-list.md).

## Edit an existing iteration

1. To open a workstream, click [!UICONTROL **View workstream**].
1. Open the iteration using one of these methods:

   * On the Card List tab, in the iteration view, click the [!UICONTROL **Iteration details**] icon ![Iteration details](assets/iteration-details-button.png).
   * On the iteration board, click the [!UICONTROL **Iteration details**] icon ![Iteration details](assets/iteration-details-button.png) in the metrics area on the top right.

1. Edit the iteration as needed, and click [!UICONTROL **Save**].

   Once an iteration has started, you can only change the iteration name.
