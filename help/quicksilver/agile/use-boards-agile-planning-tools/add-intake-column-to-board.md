# Add an intake column to a board

You can optionally add an intake column to your board that automatically pulls in tasks and issues as connected cards when they are added in Workfront, based on filters that you set up. The intake column can serve as a backlog column for your agile planning, or for any other purpose you need.

Only one intake column is permitted on a board, and it always appears as the left-most column.

For more information on columns, see [Manage board columns](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/manage-board-columns.md). For information on connected cards, see [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td>
