# Add an intake column to a board

You can optionally add an intake column to your board that automatically pulls in tasks and issues as connected cards when they are added in [!DNL Workfront], based on filters that you define. The intake column can serve as a backlog column for a Kanban team, an intake location for a support team to see issues as they are added to a request queue, or any other purpose you need.

Only one intake column is permitted on a board, and it always appears as the left-most column.

The intake column is not available on a dynamic board.

The intake column is limited to 300 tasks and 300 issues. They are sorted by the priority defined on the items. For information about priority, see [Update task priority](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/tasks/task-information/task-priority.md) and [Update issue priority](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/issues/issue-information/update-issue-priority.md).

For more information on columns, see [Manage board columns](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/manage-board-columns.md). For information on connected cards, see [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can filter the intake column to include both tasks and issues, but you must set up the filters separately for each object type.
   >
   >Also, saved filters and system default filters are available for you to select.

1. On the filter panel, click **[!UICONTROL New filter]** to get started.

   ![Click New filter](assets/intake-filter-dialog5.png)

1. Build your filter and click **[!UICONTROL Save as new]**.

   ![Filter builder](assets/intake-filter-dialog6.png)

   This example shows a filter for tasks from a specific project that are in the status of [!UICONTROL New] or [!UICONTROL In Progress], and are assigned to me.

   For details about building a filter, see the section "Create or edit a filter in the standard builder" in the article [Create or edit filters in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-filters.md).

1. Name the filter and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   ![Type a name for the filter](assets/intake-filter-dialog7.png)

   Giving the filter a unique name allows you to search for it later.

1. The filter appears in your list of saved filters, and it is automatically applied to the intake column. Click the X at the top of the filter panel to close it.

   >You can update the filters at any time by opening the Configure panel, clicking **[!UICONTROL Filter sources]**, and selecting **[!UICONTROL Tasks]** or **[!UICONTROL Issues]**.

## Use the intake column

Cards in the intake column are not editable until you move them into other board columns. You can click on the card to open it in a read-only view, or click ![Open task or issue](assets/boards-launch-icon.png) to open the task or issue in a new browser tab.


You can manually re-order the items on the intake column.

The icons on the top right of the intake column show you how many cards are currently in the column, and how many filters are applied.

1. (Optional) To search for an item in the intake column, click ![Search icon](assets/search-icon.png) on the column.
1. (Optional) To move a card from the intake column into another column, drag and drop the card into the position you want it to appear.

   Or

   Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu icon](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) on the card, and select **[!UICONTROL Move]**. Then, on the **[!UICONTROL Move Item]** box, choose another column and select **[!UICONTROL Move]**.

1. (Optional) To delete the intake column, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu icon](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) and select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
