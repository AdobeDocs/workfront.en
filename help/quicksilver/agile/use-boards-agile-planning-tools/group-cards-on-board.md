# Use groups on a board

You can group cards on a board by assignee or by tag. When you select an option to group by, the cards appear in a swimlane format. Unassigned cards or cards without tags appear in their own swimlane.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any cards in the intake column are not included in a group. For information on the intake column, see [Add an intake column to a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/add-intake-column-to-board.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td>

## Group cards on a board

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![Main Menu](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Boards**.
1. Access a board. For information, see [Create or edit a board](../../agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).
1. Click **Group** to open the group panel on the left of the board.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The default setting to group by is **None**. You can select this option at any time to remove a group and show only the columns on the board.

1. To group the cards, select **Assignees** or **Tags**.

   The cards are grouped automatically. Click the arrow next to the group name to collapse and expand the group.

1. Select what happens when a card is moved to another group.

   * **Add on assignees / Add on tags:** The assignees or tags in the new group are added to the existing list of assignees or tags on the card.
   * **Override assignees / Override tags:** The assignees or tags in the new group override all other assignees or tags, and become the only assignees or tags on the card.
