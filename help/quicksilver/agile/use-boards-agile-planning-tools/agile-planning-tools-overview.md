# Agile planning tools overview

As you create a board using ad hoc and connected cards, you might want to take advantage of additional agile planning tools.

Tools useful for Kanban include:

* WIP limits on columns
* Grouping cards into swimlanes
* An intake column that can be used for a backlog

Tools useful for Scrum include:

* Workstreams and iteration boards
* Card list or backlog
* Iteration metrics

You can use any or all of these tools in a way that works for you and your team, without committing to a specific agile methodology.
