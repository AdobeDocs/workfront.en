## Delete a user in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]

To delete a user in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion], you must deactivate the user through the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console].

* The user is removed from a group that is linked to a product profile, and is not included in any other group linked to a product profile.
* The user is removed from a product profile and is not assigned to another product profile.
* The user is deleted or deactivated in the organization that includes Workfront Fusion.

  For instructions, see the section "Remove users" in [Manage users individually](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-users-individually.html).

In [!DNL Workfront Fusion], the deactivation affects the user in one of the following ways:

* If the user is in only one organization, the user is deactivated.
* If the user is in more than one organization, the user is removed from the organization that the user was modified in on the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console].
