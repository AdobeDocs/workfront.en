# Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront Fusion/Adobe Admin Console)

If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, your users use the Adobe Admin Console to access Adobe Workfront Fusion. This means that:

* User management is largely done through the Adobe Admin Console
* Authentication is handled through the Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) rather than through Workfront

## Differences for Workfront Fusion users

For a video describing how the change to the Adobe Admin Console affects your experience as a Workfront Fusion user, see [Fusion on IMS - Regular user](https://vimeo.com/770774579).

## SSO (Single Sign-On)

Because the Adobe Business Platform controls Single Sign-On (SSO) for users, the following actions and functionality are handled automatically through the Adobe Business Platform. If your organization has not yet been onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform, you must perform these actions in Workfront Fusion. If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform, you can not see these options in your Workfront Fusion environment.
