## HTTP methods

Use one of the following HTTP methods.

* **GET**: Retrieves data from a web server based on your parameters. GET requests a representation of the specified resource, and receives a 200 OK response message with the requested content if successful.
* **POST**: Sends data to a web server based on your parameters. POST requests include actions like uploading a file. Multiple POSTs may result in a different outcome than a single POST, so be cautious about unintentionally sending multiple POSTs. If a POST is successful, you receive a 200 OK response message.
* **PUT**: Sends data to a location in the web server based on your parameters. PUT requests include actions like uploading a file. The difference between a PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent, meaning that the result of a single successful PUT is the same as many identical PUTs. If a PUT is successful, you receive a 200 response message (usually 201 or 204).
* **PATCH**: (Not available for some API call modules) Applies partial modifications to a resource on a web server based on your parameters. PATCH is not idempotent, meaning that the result of multiple PATCHâ€™s could have unintended consequences. If a PUT is successful, you will receive a 200 response message (usually 204).
* **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource from the web server based on your parameters (if the resource exists). If a DELETE is successful, you receive a 200 OK response message.
