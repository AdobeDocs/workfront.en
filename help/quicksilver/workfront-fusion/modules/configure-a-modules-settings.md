# Configure a module's settings in Adobe Workfront Fusion

You must configure settings for every module you create.

For example, the [Dropbox modules](../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/dropbox-modules.md) modules require you to specify the target folder where you want to upload files. For the [Email modules](../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/email-modules.md) modules, you need to enter the email address where emails should be sent.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Besides the module settings, you can also adjust settings for a scenario. You can rename your scenario, change its schedule, and specify additional settings, just to name a few of the possibilities.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan, Work</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront Fusion license**</td> 
   <td> <p>Workfront Fusion for Work Automation and Integration </p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>Your organization must purchase Adobe Workfront Fusion as well as Adobe Workfront to use functionality described in this article.</td> 
  </tr>  
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Configure a module's settings

1. Add a new module to a scenario.

   Or

   Click the icon of the module in the scenario editor, as described in [Create a scenario in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

1. If required for the module, create a **Connection** to your registered user account for that given service, as described in [About connecting Adobe Workfront Fusion to an app or service](../../workfront-fusion/connections/about-connecting-wf-fusion-to-app-or-service.md).
1. In each field, type the appropriate text.

   Or

   Click **Map** if it appears to the right of the field, then map an item from another module in your scenario.

   Bolded parameters are required.

   For information about the different item data types Workfront Fusion can recognize (such as date, number, and text), see [Item data types in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/item-data-types.md).

1. (Conditional) If the module has advanced options you want to display and use, select **Show advanced settings**.
