# Configure a module's settings in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]

You must configure settings for every module you create.

For example, the [[!DNL Dropbox] modules](../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/dropbox-modules.md) modules require you to specify the target folder where you want to upload files. For the [[!UICONTROL Email] modules](../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/email-modules.md) modules, you need to enter the email address where emails should be sent.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Besides the module settings, you can also adjust settings for a scenario. You can rename your scenario, change its schedule, and specify additional settings, among other actions.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

## Configure a module's settings

   Or

   Click the icon of the module in the scenario editor, as described in [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

1. If required for the module, create a **[!UICONTROL Connection]** to your registered user account for that given service, as described in [About connecting [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] to an app or service](../../workfront-fusion/connections/about-connecting-wf-fusion-to-app-or-service.md).
1. In each field, type the appropriate text.

   Or

   Click **[!UICONTROL Map]** if it appears to the right of the field, then map an item from another module in your scenario.

   Bolded parameters are required.

   For information about the different item data types [!DNL Workfront Fusion] can recognize (such as date, number, and text), see [Item data types in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/item-data-types.md).

1. (Conditional) If the module has advanced options you want to display and use, select **[!UICONTROL Show advanced settings]**.
