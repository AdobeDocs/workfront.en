# Data structures in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]

A data structure is a document that describes in detail the format of the data being transferred to [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]. Based on this document, the scenario editor is able to figure out which module returns or receives which kind of data. The data structure documents are most commonly used for serializing/parsing data formats such as JSON, XML, CSV and others.

You can create a data structure by clicking the [!UICONTROL Create a new data structure] button in the [!UICONTROL Data structure overview] section or in the settings of the module that requires data structure specification.

Supported data types are described in the [[!UICONTROL Types of modules]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md) article.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
    <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!DNL Pro] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan], [!UICONTROL Work]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Adobe Workfront Fusion] license**</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront Fusion] for Work Automation and Integration] </p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>Your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

For information on [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md).

## Data structure generator

Data structures don't always have to be created. You can make it easier by using a template from our built-in generator. By providing a data sample, the generator will automatically create a data structure based on the data sample you entered. The created data structure can then be manually modified.
