# Data structures in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]

A data structure is a document that describes in detail the format of the data being transferred to [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion].

The data structure documents are most commonly used for serializing/parsing data formats such as JSON, XML, CSV and others.

You can create a data structure by clicking the [!UICONTROL Create a new data structure] button in the [!UICONTROL Data structure overview] section or in the settings of the module that requires data structure specification.

Supported data types are described in the [[!UICONTROL Types of modules]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md) article.

## Data structure generator

Data structures don't always have to be created. You can make it easier by using a template from our built-in generator. By providing a data sample, the generator will automatically create a data structure based on the data sample you entered. The created data structure can then be manually modified.
