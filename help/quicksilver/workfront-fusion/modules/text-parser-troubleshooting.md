  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan], [!UICONTROL Work]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Adobe Workfront Fusion] license**</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront Fusion] for Work Automation and Integration] </p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

## Troubleshooting

Case scenario example, you would like to parse the filetype of a file document "filename.docx" and the extension of the filename always varies from DOCX to PDF to CSV.

The expression that you may choose to use in this case is [!DNL \..+]

If you were to use this on regex expression on [!DNL regex101].com you will rightly find that you will get a full match.

As you will notice on the image above, the file extension was correctly matched. If you take this and try to implement it in your text parser:

![](assets/text-parser-350x602.png)

you will not get a match:

![](assets/text-parser-you-dont-get-a-match-350x365.png)

The reason for this is that the "i" shows only the number of matches per match so in this case, we have 2 matches, threfore after the "i" there is a numerical value 1 and 2. The use case for this is that should you ever need to match or pass data through a filter only the second matched value you can specify which value that is represented by the numerical value.

![](assets/text-parser-matches-350x355.png)

To be able to get the match values that you require to add brackets to the part that you want to parse (for example, to extract from "filename.docx" - "docx" only), then, according to the regex expression we are using for this case scenario, the brackets should be applied on &#92;.(.+)

This captures the DOCX, places it in a group, and leave the "." out of it.

![](assets/text-parser-get-matches-350x592.png)

The output shown in the picture below, you will notice that the capturing group will match any character (except for line terminators)

![](assets/text-parser-output-350x389.png)

Another workaround that also incorporates regex is using the replace function

`{{replace("abcdefghijklmno pqr stuvw xyz.docx"; "/.\./"; ".")}}`

Then replace abcdefghijklmno pqr stuvw xyz.docx with your actual filename variable.
