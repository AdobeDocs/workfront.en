# Choose where a trigger module starts in Adobe Workfront Fusion

Some trigger modules allow you to select the first bundle from which you want the retrieving of bundles to start.

You can also specify whether you want to retrieve all bundles or just the bundles from after a specific date.

For more information about trigger modules, see the section [Trigger modules](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md#triggers) in the article [Types of modules](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:
