## [!DNL Google Services] restrictions

[!DNL Google] introduced restrictions on how users can use their API as of June 1st, 2020. These security measures protect [!DNL Google] users from leakage or misuse of their personal data on [!DNL Google]. The restrictions are related to the [!DNL Gmail] and [!DNL Google Drive] apps. For more information about these restrictions, see "Additional Requirements for Specific API Scopes" in the [[!DNL Google] API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes)

To access restricted scopes, the connected service ([!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] or any other service that wants to access the user's data via the API) must be verified and must have a Letter of Assessment to prove that the service is secure and transparent about how they use the data. [!DNL Workfront Fusion] complies with all of [!DNL Google]'s requirements for access to restricted scopes. However, most of the third-party connected services in [!DNL Workfront Fusion] don't have the Letter of Assessment, and therefore don't comply with [!DNL Google] terms. Because of that, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] is not permitted to send data to these services.

## Exceptions to [!DNL Google Services] restrictions

There are a few exceptions that make it possible to send data to an unapproved third-party service that doesn't have the Letter of Assessment without violating any of the new restrictions. They differ based on [!DNL G Suite] with the [!DNL Workfront Fusion] OAuth client, [!DNL G Suite] with another OAuth client, or [!DNL @gmail.com] and [!DNL @google.mail.com].

* [[!DNL G suite] with [!DNL Workfront Fusion] OAuth client](#dnl-g-suite-with-dnl-workfront-fusion-oauth-client)
* [[!DNL G suite] with another OAuth client](#dnl-g-suite-with-another-oauth-client)
* [[!DNL @gmail.com] and [!DNL @googlemail.com]](#dnl-gmailcom-and-dnl-googlemailcom)

### [!DNL G suite] with [!DNL Workfront Fusion] OAuth client

[!DNL Workfront Fusion] uses the [!UICONTROL Domain-wide Installation] exception. Domain-wide Installation is suited for [!DNL G Suite] users, and allows users to integrate unapproved services without any limitations. If you are a G Suite user, you don't have to perform any additional steps and can directly connect to unapproved services.

### [!DNL G suite] with another OAuth client 

[!DNL G Suite] users that prefer to use their own OAuth client instead of using the [!DNL Workfront Fusion] OAuth client can connect to [!DNL Google Services] through the [!UICONTROL Internal] Use approach. This option is intended for advanced users. For instructions, see [Connect [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] to [!DNL Google Services] using a custom OAuth client](../../workfront-fusion/connections/connect-fusion-to-google-using-oauth.md).

### [!DNL @gmail.com] and [!DNL @googlemail.com]  

User that access [!DNL Google Services] through [!DNL @gmail.com] or [!DNL @googlemail.com] can connect to [!DNL Google Services] through the Personal Use approach. This option is intended for advanced users. For instructions, see [Connect [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] to [!DNL Google Services] using a custom OAuth client](../../workfront-fusion/connections/connect-fusion-to-google-using-oauth.md).
