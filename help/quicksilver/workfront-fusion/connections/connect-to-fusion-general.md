## Create a connection

To create a connection inside a [!DNL Workfront Fusion] module:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** next to the [!UICONTROL Connection] box to open the **[!UICONTROL Create a connection]** panel.
1. (Optional) Change the default **[!UICONTROL Connection name]**.
1. (Conditional) If the app requires advanced connection settings, such as an ID, key, or [!UICONTROL secret], enter that information.

   You might need to click **[!UICONTROL Show advanced settings]** to display the fields where you can enter this kind of information.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.
1. In the sign-in window that displays, enter your credentials to log in to the app if you haven't already done so.
1. (Conditional) If an **[!UICONTROL Allow]** button displays, examine the actions that the connector will be able to take, then click the button to connect the app to [!DNL Workfront Fusion].

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Some Microsoft apps use the same connection, which is tied to individual user permissions. Therefore, when creating a connection, the permissions consent screen displays any permissions that were previously granted to this user's connection, in addition to any new permissions needed for the current application. 
   >
   >For example, if a user has "Read table" permissions granted via the Excel connector and then creates a connection in the Outlook connector to read emails, the permissions consent screen will show both the already granted "Read table" permission and the newly required "Write email" permission.
