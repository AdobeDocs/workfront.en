# Navigate the new experience in Workfront Fusion

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article will be removed in the near future.

 Workfront Fusion has been updated for users that do not access Fusion through the Adobe Experience Cloud. The new Fusion UI provides a more seamless experience with other Adobe products, and will smooth the transition of your users to the Adobe Experience Cloud.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>* The legacy Fusion experience will be deprecated on August 15, 2024.
>* When loading for the first time, the new Fusion experience may load slowly (30-60 seconds). After the first time, Fusion will load more quickly.
