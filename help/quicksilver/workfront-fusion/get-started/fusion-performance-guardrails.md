# Adobe Workfront Fusion performance guardrails

Adobe Workfront Fusion requires an Adobe Workfront Fusion license in addition to an Adobe Workfront license.
Work automation requires rapid processing, so Adobe Workfront Fusion is designed for high performance. Because long-running scenarios can slow down the pace of your work, weâ€™ve designed Workfront Fusion with performance-preserving guardrails that limit execution time, data size, and other scenario parameters. Workfront Fusion designers should be aware of these guardrails and incorporate them into their design practices.

## Scenarios

* The default scenario execution timeout is **40 minutes**. When the execution reaches this timeout, Workfront Fusion interrupts scenario execution after the next cycle or operation, depending on the scenario. This forces the scenario to stop shortly after the 40 minute limit is reached
* The maximum size of a scenario blueprint is **5 MB**, but we recommend keeping scenario size under **3 MB**.

  App modules that create or update data with large numbers of fields can cause very large blueprints.

   * When using the Workfront app, be sure to only select fields needed for your create or update use cases. 
   * When using other apps, use custom API modules to interact with any record type that has a large number of fields.

* While there is no cap for the number of modules in a scenario, scenarios with more than 150 modules negatively impact the performance of your Workfront Fusion system. For this reason, we do not recommend creating scenarios with over 150 modules.

## Operations

* The default operation timeout is typically **40 seconds**.
* The operation timeout for calls to Adobe Workfront is **120 seconds**.

## Files

* Fusion's total processing capacity for files is **1 GB**. The limit is based on a total memory cost. Every operation contributes to that cost. If a single file of **400 MB** is downloaded and uploaded then the total cost to the file capacity would be 800 MB.

## Server Memory Usage

* Server memory usage for a single execution is limited to **1 GB**.

  Many factors, such as large files or complex modules, can affect server memory usage in ways that are difficult to predict or control. Because of this, your scenario execution may exceed the 1 GB memory limit, even if the scenario follows all other performance guardrails. Exceeding the memory limit causes the execution to fail.

## Webhooks

* The default maximum size of a payload is **5 MB**.
* Webhooks are limited to 100 requests per second. When this limit is reached, Workfront Fusion sends a 429 (Too Many Requests) status.
