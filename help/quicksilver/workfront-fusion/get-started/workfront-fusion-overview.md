## Workfront Fusion overview

The role of [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] is to automate your processes so that your users don't need to spend as much time on routine tasks. It works by linking actions within and between apps and services to create a scenario that transfers and transforms your data automatically. The scenario you create watches for data in an app or service and processes that data to provide the result you want.

A scenario in Workfront Fusion represents a specific workflow. For example, a very simple scenario could watch a specific Workfront request queue for requests, and then automatically convert those requests to projects using a template.

Scenarios can be built to address very specific situations and use cases. You can use filters to change the action based on data fields or properties, iterate through files or data, save data to a data store and use it in another scenario run, or configure your scenario in many other ways. 

You can also add applications other than Workfront to your scenario. Fusion includes many dedicated connectors for outside applications, including applications by Adobe, Google, Microsoft, and many others. If there is not a dedicated connector for an application, Fusion includes ways to connect to any service with a public API.

Workfront Fusion also offers features that support scenarios, such as scenario creation templates, execution history, and debugging.

>Workfront Fusion supports only Chrome-based browsers.
