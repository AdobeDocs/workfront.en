Because the applications that Workfront Fusion connects to may update or release new version, it is occasionally necessary for Fusion to release updated modules for those applications. 

If you see a green Upgrade module icon on a module in a scenario, Workfront Fusion has released a new version of that module.

You can update the module without creating a new scenario.

1. Click the **Upgrade module** icon ![Upgrade icon](assets/upgrade-icon.png) on the module you want to upgrade to a new version.
1. Click **Show me new modules**.
1. Select the new module that matches the existing module.
1. Configure the module with the same settings as the existing module.
1. Connect the new module to the scenario in the same place as the existing module.
1. Delete the old module.
