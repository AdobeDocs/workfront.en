# Update a module to a new verison in an [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] scenario

Because the applications that Workfront Fusion connects to may update or release new version, it is occasionally necessary for Fusion to release updated modules for those applications. 

If you see a green Upgrade module icon on a module in a scenario, Workfront Fusion has released a new version of that module.

1. Select the new module that matches the existing module.
1. Configure the module with the same settings as the existing module.
1. Connect the new module to the scenario in the same place as the existing module.
