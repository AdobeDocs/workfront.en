To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

For information on [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md).

## Open the scenario settings

1. Open the scenario editor, as explained in [The scenario editor in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/scenario-editor.md).
1. Click the gear icon near the lower-left corner of the page.

   ![](assets/scenario-settings-350x221.png)

   In the [!UICONTROL Scenario settings] panel that displays, you can configure various advanced settings for the scenario.

## [!UICONTROL Allow storing incomplete executions]

This option determines how [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] proceeds if an error occurs during the execution of a scenario. With this option enabled, the scenario is paused and moved to [View and resolve incomplete executions in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-and-resolve-incomplete-executions.md). This gives you the possibility to fix the issue and continue executing from where the scenario was stopped. If this option is disabled, the scenario run stops and a rollback phase is started.

## [!UICONTROL Sequential processing]

This option forces all executions to happen in order, and is primarily relevant for Webhooks and for Incomplete Executions.

When sequential processing is enabled, parallel executions of the scenario are disabled.

### Instant Webhooks

If a webhook trigger is configured as `instant` and "Sequential processing" is enabled, then all instant webhook payloads will be queued and processed in the order that they arrive. This can be useful when processing events from external systems in an exact order.

>[!NOTE]
>
>There will be automatic processing delays as each payload is processed before the next is started.

### Incomplete Executions

If "Incomplete Executions" is also enabled, if an error occurs during the execution of a scenario, the scenario is paused. One of the following then occurs:

* If the Sequential processing option is **enabled**, Workfront Fusion stops processing the pre-existing sequence until all incomplete executions are resolved.
* If the Sequential processing option is **disabled**, the scenario continues to run according to its schedule, accompanied by repeated attempts to rerun the incomplete executions.

For more information on incomplete executions, see [View and resolve incomplete executions in Adobe Workfront Fusion](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-and-resolve-incomplete-executions.md).

<!--

This option determines how [!DNL Workfront Fusion] proceeds if an error occurs and the execution of a scenario is moved to the [View and resolve incomplete executions in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-and-resolve-incomplete-executions.md). If the [!UICONTROL Sequential processing] option is enabled, Workfront Fusion stops processing the task sequence altogether until all incomplete executions are resolved. If the [!UICONTROL Sequential processing] option is disabled, the scenario continues to run according to its schedule, accompanied by repeated attempts to rerun the incomplete executions.-->

>[!NOTE]
>
>Sequential processing may cause a delay in the execution of a scenario. If there are incomplete executions still in the queue when an instant scenario triggers or a scheduled scenario is set to execute, that scenario will execute after all of the executions before it in the queue are complete.
>
>If the use case for your scenarios does not require sequential processing, we recommend disabling the sequential processing option.

For more information on scheduling, see [Schedule a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/schedule-a-scenario.md).

## Data is confidential

Once a scenario has been executed, you can by default display information about which data was processed by modules in the scenario. If you do not want this information to be stored, enable the [!UICONTROL Data is confidential] option.

For more information about displaying information, see [Scenario execution flow in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/scenario-execution-flow.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you enable this option, it may be difficult to solve errors that may occur during the execution of a scenario.

## Enable data loss

This option has to do with enabling data loss if [!DNL Workfront Fusion] fails to save a bundle to the queue of [View and resolve incomplete executions in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-and-resolve-incomplete-executions.md) (for example, due to a lack of free space). With this option enabled, the data is lost in order to prevent interruptions in the overall scenario execution. This is useful for scenarios where the highest priority is continuous execution and the incoming erroneous data is not that important.

Beyond that, when executing a scenario, a module can sometimes encounter a file that is larger than the maximum allowed size. In this case, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] proceeds in accordance with the setting of the [!UICONTROL Enable data loss] option and a warning message is shown.

For more information about maximum file size, see [About mapping files in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/about-mapping-files.md).

For more information on warnings, see [Error processing in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/errors/error-processing.md).

## [!UICONTROL Auto commit]

The [!UICONTROL Auto commit] settings applies to transactions and defines the way to process a scenario. If the Auto commit option is on, the commit phase on each module starts immediately after completing the operation phase. With the Auto commit option disabled, no commit occurs until operations are executed for all modules (this is the default mode).

For more information on transactions, see [Scenario execution, cycles, and phases in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/scenario-execution-cycles-phases.md).

## Maximum number of cycles

Setting more cycles can be useful when you want to prevent connection interruption to a third-party service and assure that all records are processed within the one scenario run.

* If the scenario starts with a polling trigger, the setting defines the maximum number of cycles allowed during the scenario execution.

   For more information on polling triggers, see [Polling triggers](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md#polling) in [Types of modules](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md).

* If the scenario starts with an instant trigger, the setting is ignored and all the pending events are processed during a single scenario execution, one event per one cycle.

   For more information on instant triggers, see [Instant triggers](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md#instant) in [Types of modules](../../workfront-fusion/modules/module-types.md).

* If the scenario does not start with a trigger (instant/polling), the specified maximum number of cycles is always performed.

## Number of consecutive errors

Defines the maximum number of consecutive execution attempts before the execution of a scenario is deactivated (excluding [!UICONTROL DataError], [!UICONTROL DuplicateDataError] and [!UICONTROL ConnectionError]).

For more information on errors, see [Error processing in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/errors/error-processing.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a scenario starts with an instant trigger, the setting is ignored and the scenario is deactivated immediately once the first error has occurred.
