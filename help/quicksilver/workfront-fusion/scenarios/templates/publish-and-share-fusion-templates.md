# Publish and share Adobe Workfront Fusion templates

When you create a template, your template becomes available for all your team members. If you want to share the template with someone outside of your team, you must publish it first.

For information on creating a template, see [Create new templates in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/templates/create-new-fusion-templates.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

<table>

   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr>

## Template statuses

You can check the status on your template page under the template name

The following statuses are available:

* **Private**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team.
* **Published**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team. You can send published templates for approval and copy a shareable link.
* **Approved**: This template is visible for all Workfront Fusion users in the Public templates tab. You can copy a shareable link by clicking Options in the upper-right corner of the screen.

You can also check the status from the Team templates tab. If a template is published, it will have an icon to the right of the template name.

* **Eye icon**: The template is published, it is visible only for the team, and the approval request was not sent.
* **Yellow checkmark icon**: The template is published, it is visible only for the team, and the approval request was sent.
* **Green checkmark icon**: The template is published and public. It is visible for any Workfront Fusion user in the Public templates tab. It is also still visible in the Team templates tab, and the template author or their team member can still edit it.

Templates without icons have Private status. They are not published and are visible only to the team.
