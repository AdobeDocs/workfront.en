## View a template

1. Click the Templates icon ![](assets/fusion-template-icon.png) in the side navigation menu.
1. Select the tab that contains the template you want to view.

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Public templates</td> 
      <td> <p> All templates that were published and then approved by the administrator. On the template tiles, you can see the name of the template, its preview, and the socket icon with a number indicating how many times the template has been used so far.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Team templates</td> 
      <td> <p>All templates created by your team members including the ones that were already made public by the administrator. On the template tiles, you can see the name of the template, the status icons that are described in detail in the Publishing and sharing templates section of this documentation, and the Delete buttons.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. (Optional) Search for the template you want to view. You can search by the name of the template or by the name of the app used in the particular template.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* If the template you want to access was not created by a you or member of your team, and is not public yet, you can ask the person who created and published it to share the template link with you.
   >* If you cannot find the public template that has been created by you, contact the administrator. It is possible that before approving your template, the administrator had renamed it.

1. Click the template that you want to view.

## Edit a template

You can edit any templates that are available in the Team templates tab.

1. Click the **Templates** icon ![](assets/fusion-template-icon.png) in the side navigation menu.
1. Click the **Team templates** tab.
1. Click the **Private** tab.
1. Click the template you want to edit.
1. Click **Edit** in the top-right corner

   or

   Click the template diagram.

1. Make changes in the template. You can access all options that were available when creating the template. To see these options, see [Create new templates in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/templates/create-new-fusion-templates.md). Then click the save icon at the very bottom of the page.
1. Click the **Save** icon ![](assets/save-icon.png).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Team templates tab includes not only the published templates, but also copies of the templates that were already made public by the administrator. This means you can edit a template that is already visible to everyone. If you modify one of these templates, your changes do not overwrite the public template right away. The template in the Public templates tab is still untouched and stays public, but its newer version with your changes from the Team templates tab goes to the beginning of the publishing process. When the modifiedis published and approved by the administrator, it overwrites the original public template.

## Delete a template

You can only delete templates that are not yet approved. If you want to delete a public template, contact your administrator.

Please note that once you delete a template, it cannot be restored. Team templates are available for all members of your team so before deleting a template we advise you to check if other team members do not need it.

1. Click the **Templates** icon ![](assets/fusion-template-icon.png) in the side navigation menu.
1. Click the **Team templates** tab.
1. Click **Delete** next to the template name

   Or

   Click the name of the template to go into the template. Click **Options** in the top right corner and select **Delete**.

1. Click **Really?** to confirm the delete.
