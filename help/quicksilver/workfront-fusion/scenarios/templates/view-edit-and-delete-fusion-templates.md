   >* If you cannot find the public template that has been created by you, contact the administrator. It is possible that before approving your template, the administrator had renamed it.

The template in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab is still untouched and stays public, but its newer version with your changes from the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab goes to the beginning of the publishing process. When the modifiedis published and approved by the administrator, it overwrites the original public template.
