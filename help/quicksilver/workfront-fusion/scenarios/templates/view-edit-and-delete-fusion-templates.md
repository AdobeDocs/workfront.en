    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Public templates]</td>

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* If the template you want to access was not created by a you or member of your team, and is not public yet, you can ask the person who created and published it to share the template link with you.
   >* If you cannot find the public template that has been created by you, contact the administrator. It is possible that before approving your template, the administrator had renamed it.


1. Click the template that you want to view.

## Edit a template

>The [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab includes not only the published templates, but also copies of the templates that were already made public by the administrator. This means you can edit a template that is already visible to everyone. If you modify one of these templates, your changes do not overwrite the public template right away. The template in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab is still untouched and stays public, but its newer version with your changes from the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab goes to the beginning of the publishing process. When the modifiedis published and approved by the administrator, it overwrites the original public template.

## Delete a template

You can only delete templates that are not yet approved. If you want to delete a public template, contact your administrator.
