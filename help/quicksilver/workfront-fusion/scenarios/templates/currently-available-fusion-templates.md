# Currently available Adobe Workfront Fusion templates

The following public templates are currently available in Adobe Workfront Fusion.

Your team or organization may have other team-created templates available. 

To view available templates, click the **Templates** icon ![](assets/fusion-template-icon.png) in the side navigation menu.

## Workfront templates

These templates automate Workfront processes and workflows.

### Workfront - Convert approved issue to project

This template converts Issues to Projects. You can modify it to meet your organization's standards.

### Tailored Notification Based on Field Change

This template creates tailored updates (and related notifications) to individuals working on a Workfront project, based upon some unique event such as a change in a field value. The scenario watches Workfront for when a specified field changes in a Task or Issue. When encountered, the scenario will evaluate information in the related project and create a tailored update for a person assigned to a specific role on the project.

### Workfront - Bulk append to project name with convention

This bulk update template renames all projects that meet the criteria of a search (fall within a portfolio) and rename them with a standard format.

### Workfront - Rename projects with convention

This template locates all projects that meet the criteria of a filter (fall within a portfolio), and renames them with a standard format.

### Workfront - Create Baseline on Status Change

This template captures a project baseline upon any project status change noted in the "switch" modules, and creates an update in the update stream for logging.

### Workfront - Baseline creation on weekly basis

This template captures a project baseline on a weekly basis every Monday at 6am ET on projects filtered by portfolio, and creates an update in the update stream for logging.

## Workfront - Workfront Proof templates

These templates automate workflows that combine Workfront with Workfront Proof.

### Workfront Proof > Workfront - Project Update on Proof Decision

When a decision is made on a Proof that is added directly to a project, this automation gathers information on the Proof Decision, such as who made the Decision, and then reflects this progress in the corresponding Workfront Project as an update.

### Workfront Proof > Workfront - Task Update and Completion (if Approved) on Proof Decision

Where individual proofs are tied to individual tasks, this scenario closes the associated task when an approval decision on the proof is made. If approved, it completes the task and updates the project.

## HTTP - Workfront templates

These templates retrieve information from a web service, and bring that information into Workfront.

### APILayer > Workfront - Daily Exchange Rate Update (EUR)

This template creates a scenario that automates the updating of an exchange rate at a set point in time. This scenario pulls the rate of Euros (EUR) to US Dollars (USD) from an APIlayers.com API and updates the rate in Workfront.

## Workfront-Anaplan templates

These templates support the Workfront-Anaplan integration, and expect a specific configuration in both Anaplan in Workfront. For information on these templates and their required configurations, see the articles for the individual templates.

For more information on the Workfront-Anaplan integration, see [Adobe Workfront with Anaplan](../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/adobe-workfront-with-anaplan/anaplan-integration.md).
