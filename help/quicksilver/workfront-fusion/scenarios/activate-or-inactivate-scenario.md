# Activate or deactivate a scenario in Adobe Workfront Fusion

You can work with scenarios either in an active or an inactive state:

* An active scenario executes periodically according to its defined schedule, as explained in [Schedule a scenario in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/schedule-a-scenario.md).

  This is useful when you want to automate the function of a scenario.

  <!--
  <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">For example, you could create an active Instagram-to-Dropbox scenario with a once-per-day schedule that uploads the photos you post on Instagram to Dropbox every day. </p>
  -->

* An inactive scenario executes only when you run it manually.

  This is useful when you want to run the scenario only at certain times.

You can activate or deactivate a scenario at any time, depending on how you want to use the scenario.

A newly created scenario is inactive by default.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:
