# Activate or deactivate a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]

You can work with scenarios either in an active or an inactive state:

* An active scenario executes periodically according to its defined schedule, as explained in [Schedule a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/schedule-a-scenario.md).

   This is useful when you want to automate the function of a scenario.

* An inactive scenario executes only when you run it manually.

   This is useful when you want to run the scenario only at certain times.

You can activate or deactivate a scenario at any time, depending on how you want to use the scenario.

A newly created scenario is inactive by default.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:
