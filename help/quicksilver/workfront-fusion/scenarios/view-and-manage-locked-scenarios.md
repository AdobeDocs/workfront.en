# Manage locked scenarios in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]

In some cases, a scenario might be temporarily locked by the [!DNL Workfront Fusion] engineering team because the scenario is causing performance or other issues. Locked executions will be automatically unlocked within 2-4 hours. You can also unlock scenarios manually.
