## Understanding locked scenarios

Scenarios may be locked for a number of reasons. 

Workfront Fusion does not support parallel processing of scheduled scenarios. These scenarios are locked at the beginning of the scenario execution and unlocked when it completes. If the execution is interrupted, the scenario may not unlock. This may occur when a user manually force-stops the scenario, or when there is a system issue.

In addition, the Workfront Fusion engineering team may lock a scenario because it is causing performance or other issues.

Regardless of the cause of a locked scenario, the scenario will unlock automatically 2-4 hours after it is locked.

## Unlock a locked scenario

Locked scenarios will unlock 2-4 hours from the time they were locked. You can unlock a scenario manually before it is scheduled to unlock automatically. 

Unlocking a scenario manually can cause errors in a scenario's executions. We recommend manually unlocking scenarios only when a scenario is locked due to running and stopping executions as part of designing the scenario. In other circumstances, we recommend that you wait for the scenario to be unlocked automatically.
