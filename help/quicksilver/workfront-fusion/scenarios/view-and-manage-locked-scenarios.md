# View and manage locked scenarios in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]

In some cases, a scenario might be temporarily locked by the [!DNL Workfront Fusion] engineering team because the scenario is causing performance or other issues. Locked executions will be automatically unlocked within 2-4 hours. You can also unlock scenarios manually.

## View the Locked scenario icon

If a scenario is locked, it will display the Locked scenario icon ![](assets/locked-scenario-icon.png). You can find the icon in the following areas of [!DNL Workfront Fusion]:

* The header of the [!UICONTROL Scenario details] page for the affected scenario.
* The [!UICONTROL Scenarios] list, in the line for the affected scenario.

If the icon is visible, the scenario is locked.

## Unlock a locked scenario

Locked scenarios will unlock 2-4 hours from the time they were locked. You can unlock a scenario manually before it is scheduled to unlock automatically.
