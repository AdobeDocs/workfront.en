# [!DNL Google Calendar] modules

In an [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] scenario, you can automate workflows that use [!UICONTROL Google Calendar], as well as connect it to multiple third-party applications and services.

If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

For information about modules, see [Modules in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

## Prerequisites

To use [!DNL Google Calendar] modules, you must have a [!DNL Google] account.

## [!DNL Google Calendar] modules and their fields

When you configure [!DNL Google Calendar] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional [!DNL Google Calendar] fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).

#### [!UICONTROL Watch events]

This trigger module executes a scenario when a new event is added, updated, deleted, started, or ended in the calendar you specify. The module returns all standard fields associated with the record or records, along with any custom fields and values that the connection accesses. You can map this information in subsequent modules in the scenario.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.

## Trigger a scenario before an event

You can trigger a scenario a specified time before an event with the help of standard [!DNL Google Calendar] email reminders and the [!UICONTROL Webhooks] >[!UICONTROL Custom mailhook] module.

1. Use the [!UICONTROL Google Calendar] >[!UICONTROL Update an event] module to add an email reminder to your event:

   ![](assets/trigger-scen-before-event-350x209.png)

1. Create a new scenario starting with the [!UICONTROL Webhooks] >[!UICONTROL Custom mailhook] module.

   1. Copy the mailhook's email address.
   1. Save the scenario and execute it.

1. In [!DNL Gmail], redirect the [!DNL Google Calendar] email reminders to the mailhook's email address:

   1. Open your **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Gmail] settings]**.
   1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Forwarding and POP/IMAP]** tab.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add a forwarding address].**
   1. Paste the copied mailhooks's email address, click&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL Next]**, confirm by pressing **[!UICONTROL Proceed]** in the popup window, then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

   1. In [!DNL Workfront Fusion], switch to the new scenario that should finish its execution by receiving the confirmation email.
   1. Click the bubble above the module to inspect the module's output.
   1. Expand the `Text` item and copy the Confirmation code:

      ![](assets/confirmation-code-350x252.png)

   1. In Gmail, paste the Confirmation code in the edit box and click&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL Verify]**:

      ![](assets/paste-code-350x46.png)

   1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Filters and Blocked Addresses]** tab.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create a new filter]**.
   1. Setup a filter for all emails coming from `     calendar-notification@google.com` and click&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL Create a filter]**:
   1. Select **[!UICONTROL Forward it to]** and choose the mailhooks's email address from the list.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create filter]** to create the filter.

1. (Optional) In [!DNL Workfront Fusion], add the [!UICONTROL Text parser] > [!UICONTROL Match pattern] module after the [!UICONTROL Webhooks] >[!UICONTROL Custom mailhook] module to parse the email's HTML code to obtain any information you need.

   For example, you could configure the module as follows to obtain the event's ID:

   *Pattern*: `<meta itemprop="eventId/googleCalendar" content="(?<evenitID>.*?)"/>`

   *Text*: The `HTML content` item outputted from the [!UICONTROL Webhooks] >[!UICONTROL Custom mailhook] module.
