# [!DNL Adobe Workfront] modules

Adobe Workfront Boards are flexible tools that allow team collaboration by providing access to a shared board that contains columns and cards.

You can use the Adobe Workfront Boards modules to read or update records, make an API call to the Workfront Boards API, or trigger a scenario when an action occurs on a board.

For general information on Workfront Boards, see [Boards overview](/help/quicksilver/agile/boards-overview.md).
