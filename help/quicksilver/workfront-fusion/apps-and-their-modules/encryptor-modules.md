[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] [!UICONTROL Encryptor] modules allow you to encrypt any text data. They currently support message encryption via AES256 and PGP ([!UICONTROL OpenPGP]).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

For information on [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md).

## Message encryption and decryption using PGP

When encrypting and decrypting via PGP, it is necessary to use a keychain and to create a private or public key (or both).

For more information on public and private keys, see [Basic terms in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/basic-terms.md). For more information on keychains, see [Keys in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/connections/keys.md).

## [!UICONTROL Encryptor] modules and their fields
