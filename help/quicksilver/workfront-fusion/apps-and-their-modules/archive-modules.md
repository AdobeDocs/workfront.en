In a [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] scenario, you can use an archive, such as a zipped file, in your scenario, allowing you to use it in your automations or integrations.

If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md). For information about modules, see [Modules in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

## [!UICONTROL Archive] modules and their fields

When you configure [!UICONTROL Archive] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional [!UICONTROL Archive] fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).

## [!UICONTROL Extract an archive] 

This action module extracts a file you identify from an archive.

The module returns the ID of the  file and any associated fields, along with any custom fields and values that the connection accesses. You can map this information in subsequent modules in the scenario.

<table style="table-layout:auto">
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Source file]</td> 
   <td> <p> Select the file you want to extract. This file can be mapped from a previous module (such as the [!DNL Workfront] >[!UICONTROL Download a document] module).</p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

>[!INFO]
>
>**Example:** Get the ZIP file from the defined [!DNL Dropbox] folder (for example, Archives), extract it using the [!UICONTROL Archive] module and send extracted files to the desired email address as attachments with the [!UICONTROL Email] or [!DNL Gmail] module.

## [!UICONTROL Create an archive] 

This aggregator module adds the desired files to a [!UICONTROL ZIP] or [!UICONTROL TAR] archive.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Source module]</td> 
   <td> <p> Select the module you want to retrieve the files from.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Type] </td> 
   <td> <p>Select whether you want to add files to a [!UICONTROL ZIP] archive or a [!UICONTROL TAR] archive.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Comment]</td> 
   <td>Enter a comment that you would like to add to the archive.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Group by]</td> 
   <td> <p>Define an expression that you want to group the aggregated output by. This expression can contain one or more mapped items. The aggregated data will be then separated into groups using this expression's value. Each group outputs as a separate bundle with a key (the evaluated expression) and a value (the aggregated text). You can use the key as a filter in subsequent modules.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Stop processing after an empty aggregation]</td> 
   <td>Select this option to stop the scenario when there are no results.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Archive name]</td> 
   <td> <p> Enter a name for the created archive. Do not add an extension.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Source file]</td> 
   <td> <p>Select a source file from a previous module, or map the source file's name and data.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

>[!INFO]

>**Example:** Watch incoming emails using the [!DNL Gmail] >[!UICONTROL Watch emails] module. If an email is received, its attachments are iterated into individual bundles then archived to the [!DNL ZIP] file and saved to the defined Dropbox folder.

## [!UICONTROL Inflate] 

This transformer module decompresses binary data using an inflation algorithm.

<table style="table-layout:auto">
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Data] </td> 
   <td> <p>Enter or map the data you want to decompress using the inflate function.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## [!UICONTROL Deflate] 

This transformer module compresses binary data using a deflation algorithm.

<table style="table-layout:auto">
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Data] </td> 
   <td> <p>Enter or map the data you want to compress using the deflate function.</p> </td>
