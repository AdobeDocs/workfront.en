## Prerequisites

In order to use SFTP with [!DNL Workfront Fusion], it is necessary to have an SFTP account (such as [!DNL GoDaddy] web hosting).

## Connect SFTP to [!DNL Workfront Fusion] {#connect-sftp-to-workfront-fusion}

To connect your SFTP account to [!DNL Workfront Fusion] you need to enter the target Host and the SFTP credentials (user name and password or user name and key) to the module's [!UICONTROL Create a connection] dialog.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Connection name]</td> 
   <td> <p> Enter the name for your SFTP connection.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>[!UICONTROL Host]</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Enter the host name of the SFTP server you want to connect.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Port] </td> 
   <td> <p>Enter the SFTP server port. For example, 22.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>[!UICONTROL Auth type]</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Select the authorization method you want to use for connecting to the SFTP server.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>[!UICONTROL User name and password]</strong>: Enter your credentials.</li> 
     <li> <p><strong>[!UICONTROL User name and key]</strong>: Enter your user name and the private key/certificate</p> <p>Upload the private key to use the client-side authorization or upload your certificate (P12 or PFX file) if you want to use TLS using your self-signed certificate. If you're using the client-side certificate authorization, you can enter your CA certificate here.</p> <p>[!DNL Workfront Fusion] does not retain or store any data (files, passwords) you provide here. File and password are only used to extract a private key/certificate.</p> </li> 
    </ul> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

After entering the connection information, click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** to establish a connection.

## [!UICONTROL SFTP] modules and their fields

When you configure [!UICONTROL SFTP] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional [!UICONTROL SFTP] fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).
