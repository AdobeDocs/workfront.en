# Adobe Authenticator modules

The Adobe Authenticator module allows you to connect to any Adobe API, using a single connection. This allows you to more easily connect to Adobe products that do not yet have a dedicated Fusion connector.

The advantage over the HTTP modules is that you can create a connection, as in a dedicated app.

To see a list of available Adobe APIs, see X. You may be able to use only the APIs to which you are assigned.
