# Flow control in Adobe Workfront Fusion

When you are creating or editing a scenario, you can configure settings to control the way data flows through it.

## Access requirements

## Repeater

You can use a [!UICONTROL Repeater] module to repeat a task a given number of times. A [!UICONTROL Repeater] module generates bundles, one after another.

For example, you could use a [!UICONTROL Repeater] module to send five emails with the subjects "Hello 1," "Hello 2," and so on, by connecting the **[!UICONTROL Email] >[!UICONTROL Send me an email]** module to the [!UICONTROL Repeater] module.

To use a [!UICONTROL Repeater] module:

1. Click the [!UICONTROL Flow Control] icon ![](assets/flow-control-icon.gif) at the bottom of the screen, then click **[!UICONTROL Repeater]** in the menu that displays.
1. Click the [!UICONTROL Repeater] bundle, then click **[!UICONTROL Connect automatically]** in the box that displays.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Flow Control] box that appears, type the number of repetitions (outputted bundles) you want in the **[!UICONTROL Repeats]** box.

   In our email example, you would type 5.

   ![](assets/repeater-2-350x207.png)

   The value of the item increases in each repetition by this value specified in the **[!UICONTROL Step]** field, which you can view by selecting **[!UICONTROL Show advanced settings]**. This number is 1 by default.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** to close the **[!UICONTROL Flow Control]** box.

1. Click the app or service module connected to the [!UICONTROL Repeater] module.
1. In the box that appears, type the information that you want to repeat.

   In our email example, you would type Hello in the [!UICONTROL Subject] box, then map `i` from the repeater module.

   ![](assets/repeater-3-350x207.png)

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| [!UICONTROL Initial value] | Enter or map the number that you want the module to set as `i` in the first iteration. The default value is 1. |
| [!UICONTROL Repeats] | Enter or map the number of times that you want the module to repeat. This number must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 10,000. |
| [!UICONTROL Step] | This is the number by which the module increases the value of `i`. The default value is 1. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The number of repeats is not determined by the value of `i`, as it would be in a loop in programming. The module will repeat the number of times indicated in the [!UICONTROL Repeats] field. The value `i` changes with each iteration of the [!DNL repeater] module, and can be mapped to later modules. The example above maps the value of `i` into the Hello message, resulting in messages that read "Hello 1," Hello 2," and so on.

## [!UICONTROL Iterator]

An [!UICONTROL Iterator] is a special type of module that converts an array into a series of bundles. Each array item will be a separate bundle in the [!UICONTROL Iterator] module output. For more information, see [[!UICONTROL Iterator] module in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/iterator-module.md).

## Array aggregator

An array aggregator is a special type of module which allows to merge several bundles into one single bundle. For more information, see [[!UICONTROL Aggregator] module in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../workfront-fusion/modules/aggregator-module.md).

## [!UICONTROL Router]

The [!UICONTROL Router] module allows you to branch your flow into several routes and process the data within each route differently. Once a [!UICONTROL Router] module receives a bundle, it forwards it to each connected route in the order the routes were attached to the [!UICONTROL Router] module. For more information, see [Router module in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/router-module.md).
