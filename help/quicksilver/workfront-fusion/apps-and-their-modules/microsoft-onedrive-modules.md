If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

For information about modules, see [Modules in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

   <td>
   <p>Current product requirement: If you have the [!UICONTROL Select] or [!UICONTROL Prime] [!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan, your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article.

   <p>Or</p>
   <p>Legacy product requirement: Your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article.</p>
   </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

For information on [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md).

## Prerequisites

To use [!DNL OneDrive] modules, you must have a [!DNL Microsoft OneDrive] account.



## OneDrive API information

The OneDrive connector uses the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Base URL</td> 
   <td> https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">API version</td> 
   <td> v1 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">API tag</td> 
   <td>v2.0.10</td> 
  </tr>
 </tbody> 
 </table>


## Connecting the [!DNL OneDrive] service to [!DNL Workfront Fusion]

For instructions about connecting your [!DNL OneDrive] account to [!UICONTROL Workfront Fusion], see [Create a connection to [!UICONTROL Adobe Workfront Fusion] - Basic instructions](../../workfront-fusion/connections/connect-to-fusion-general.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Some Microsoft apps use the same connection, which is tied to individual user permissions. Therefore, when creating a connection, the permissions consent screen displays any permissions that were previously granted to this user's connection, in addition to any new permissions needed for the current application. 
>
>For example, if a user has "Read table" permissions granted via the Excel connector and then creates a connection in the Outlook connector to read emails, the permissions consent screen will show both the already granted "Read table" permission and the newly required "Write email" permission.

## [!DNL Microsoft OneDrive] modules and their fields

When you configure [!DNL OneDrive] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional [!DNL OneDrive] fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).

## If you are unable to upload or update a file

There are several possible issues when uploading or updating a file fails:

* The uploaded file is too big and exceeds the maximum file size limit for your [!DNL OneDrive] plan or you have used all of your [!DNL OneDrive] account's storage quota. To get more storage space, delete existing files from [!DNL OneDrive] or upgrade your [!DNL OneDrive] account.
* OneDrive does not allow to upload two files with the same name to one single folder. If the target folder contains a file with the same name as the file being uploaded, the scenario run terminates with an error. The solution is to simply rename the file being uploaded. If your aim is to update a file, use the [!UICONTROL Update a file] action.
* The previously selected folder, to which the file is being uploaded, no longer exists. The scenario stops and you will need to select the target folder again.
