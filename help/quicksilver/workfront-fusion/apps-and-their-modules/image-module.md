# Image modules

[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] [!UICONTROL Image] modules allow you get information about a specific image (dimensions, type, and so on), convert an image to another file format, and directly change the size of the image.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td>
  <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td>
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan], [!UICONTROL Work]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] license**</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Workfront Fusion for Work Automation and Integration] </p>  <p>[!UICONTROL Workfront Fusion for Work Automation]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>Your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## [!UICONTROL Image] modules and their fields

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

* [[!UICONTROL Resize]](#uicontrol-resize)
* [[!UICONTROL Convert a format]](#uicontrol-convert-a-format)
* [[!UICONTROL Extract metadata]](#uicontrol-extract-metadata)

### [!UICONTROL Resize] 

This transformer module changes an image's height and width according to criteria you specify.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Source file]</td> 
   <td> <p>Select the source of the image you want to convert. You can select output from a previous module or map the data file and filename. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Data]</td> 
   <td>Map the file that you want to convert. This field is available if you selected [!UICONTROL Map] in the [!UICONTROL Source file] field.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL File name]</td> 
   <td>Enter a name for the converted file. This field is available if you selected [!UICONTROL Map] in the [!UICONTROL Source file] field.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL I want to]</td> 
   <td>Select whether you want to maintain the height-width ratio or change the dimensions to a specified height and width.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL According to]</td> 
   <td> <p>Select how you want the module to determine the new size of the image. This field appears if you selected to maintain height-width ration in the IÂ want to field. Other fields appear based on the selection in this field.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p>[!UICONTROL Maximum width]</p> <p>Reduces an image to a width you specify. Height is calculated automatically.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>[!UICONTROL Maximum height]</p> <p>Reduces an image to a height you specify. Width is calculated automatically.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>[!UICONTROL Maximum height or width]</p> <p>Reduces an image in a way that its height and width do not exceed the values you specify. Because this option maintains height-width ratio, one of the dimensions may be smaller than specified. For example, if height and width are both specified as 40, a 400x300 image will be reduced to 40X30.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>[!UICONTROL Minimum width]</p> <p>Enlarges an image to a width you specify. Height is calculated automatically.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>[!UICONTROL Minimum height]</p> <p>Enlarges an image to a height you specify. Width is calculated automatically.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>[!UICONTROL Minimum height or width]</p> <p>Enlarges an image in a way that its height and width are not smaller than the values you specify. Because this option maintains height-width ratio, one of the dimensions may be larger than specified. For example, if height and width are both specified as 300, a 40x30 image will be enlarged to 400X300.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>[!UICONTROL Percent]</p> <p>Changes the image size by a percentage based on the value you specify. </p> </li> 
    </ul> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Width]</td> 
   <td>Enter or map the desired width of the resized image in pixels.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Height]</td> 
   <td>Enter or map the desired height of the resized image in pixels.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

### [!UICONTROL Convert a format] 

This transformer module changes the format of an image file. This module is compatible the following formats:

* PNG
* JPG
* GIF
* BMP

Both the source file and the output must be in one of these formats. For example, the [!UICONTROL Image] >[!UICONTROL Convert a format] module can transform a PNG file into a BMP file, or a BMP&nbsp;into a JPG.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Source file]</td> 
   <td> <p>Select the source of the image you want to convert. You can select output from a previous module or map the data file and filename. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Data]</td> 
   <td>Map the file that you want to convert. This field is available if you selected [!UICONTROL Map] in the [!UICONTROL Source file] field.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL File name]</td> 
   <td>Enter a name for the converted file. This field is available if you selected [!UICONTROL Map] in the [!UICONTROL Source file] field.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Output format]</td> 
   <td>Select the format that you want the module to convert the source file to. </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

### [!UICONTROL Extract metadata]

This transformer module returns basic information about a module.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Source file]</td> 
   <td> <p>Select the source of the image you want to convert. You can select output from a previous module or map the data file and filename. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Data]</td> 
   <td>Map the file that you want to convert. This field is available if you selected Map in the [!UICONTROL Source file] field.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL File name]</td> 
   <td>Enter a name for the converted file. This field is available if you selected Map in the [!UICONTROL Source file] field.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Possible problems

### Action terminated with an error

There are three cases when an action can terminate with an error:

* Received data was not in the JPG/GIF/PNG/BMP format
* The maximum width/height limit had been exceeded while changing the image dimensions. The image size must not exceed 3840 px width and 2160 px height
* The maximum allowable size of an image had been exceeded while changing the dimensions or format of the image.
