In an [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] scenario, you can automate workflows that use [!DNL Google Sheets], as well as connect it to multiple third-party applications and services.

For instructions about connecting your [!DNL Google Sheets] account to [!DNL Workfront Fusion], see [Create a connection to [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] - Basic instructions](../../workfront-fusion/connections/connect-to-fusion-general.md)

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td>

  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>
   <p>Current product requirement: If you have the [!UICONTROL Select] or [!UICONTROL Prime] [!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan, your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article. [!DNL Workfront Fusion] is included in the [!UICONTROL Ultimate] [!DNL Workfront] plan.</p>
   <p>Or</p>
   <p>Legacy product requirement: Your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article.</p>
   </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

For information on [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md).

## Prerequisites

To use [!UICONTROL Google Sheets] modules, you must have a [!UICONTROL Google] account.

## Google Sheets API information

The Google Sheets connector uses the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Base URL</td> 
   <td> https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">API version</td> 
   <td> v4 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">API tag</td> 
   <td>v2.5.7</td> 
  </tr>
 </tbody> 
 </table>

## Triggers

### [!UICONTROL Watch Rows]

Retrieves values from every newly added row in the spreadsheet.

The module retrieves only new rows that have not been filled in before. The trigger will not process an overwritten row.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If the worksheet contains a blank row, no rows after the blank row will be processed.

### [!UICONTROL Add a Row] 

This module appends adds a row to a sheet.

When you configure [!DNL Google Sheets] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional [!DNL Google Sheets] fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).

## Usage Limits

If the error `429: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` occurs, you have exceeded the API rate limit.

The [!DNL Google Sheets] API has a limit of 500 requests per 100 seconds per project, and 100 requests per 100 seconds per user. Limits for reads and writes are tracked separately. There is no daily usage limit.

See more details at [developers.google.com/sheets/api/limits](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/limits).

## Tips & Tricks

* [How to get Empty Cells from a [!DNL Google] Sheet](#how-to-get-empty-cells-from-a-google-sheet)
* [Add a button in a sheet to run a scenario](#add-a-button-in-a-sheet-to-run-a-scenario)

### How to get Empty Cells from a [!DNL Google Sheet] 

Use the [!UICONTROL Search Rows (Advanced)] module & use this formula to get the columns which are empty.
<pre>select * where E is null</pre>Here "E" is the column &amp; "is null" is the condition. You can create a more advanced query using [Google Query Lang](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage).

### Add a button in a sheet to run a scenario

1. In [!DNL Workfront Fusion], insert the **[!UICONTROL Webhook]** > **[!UICONTROL Custom webhooks]** module/trigger in the scenario and configure it (see [Webhooks](../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/webhooks-updated.md)).

1. Copy the webhook's URL.
1. Execute the scenario.
1. In Google Sheets, choose **[!UICONTROL Insert]** > **[!UICONTROL Drawing]**... from the main menu bar.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Drawing] window, Click the **[!UICONTROL Text box]** icon ![](assets/text-box.png) near the top of the window.
1. Design a button and click the **[!UICONTROL Save and Close]** button in the top-right corner:
1. The button will be placed in your worksheet. Click the three vertical dots in the button's top-right corner:
1. Choose **[!UICONTROL Assign script..].** from the menu.
1. Enter the name of your script (function), e.g. `runScenario` and click **[!UICONTROL OK]**:
1. Choose **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Script editor]** from the main menu bar.

1. Insert the following code:

   * The name of the function must correspond to the name you specified in step 9.
   * Replace the URL with the webhook's URL you copied in step 2.

      <pre>function runScenario() {</pre><pre>UrlFetchApp.fetch("&lt;webhook you copied>");</pre><pre>}</pre>

1. Press **[!UICONTROL Ctrl+S]** to save the script file, enter a project name and click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

1. Switch back to [!DNL Google Sheets] and click your new button.
1. Grant the required authorization to the script:
1. In [!DNL Workfront Fusion], verify that the scenario has successfully executed.

## Storing dates in a spreadsheet

If you store a Date value in a spreadsheet without any formatting, it will appear in the spreadsheet as text in ISO 8601 format. However, [!DNL Google Sheets] formulas or functions that work with dates that do not understand this text (Example: formula `=A1+10`) will display the following error:

![](assets/mceclip6-350x87.png)

To help allow [!DNL Google Sheets] to understand the date, format it with the [[!UICONTROL formatDate] (date; format; [timezone])](../../workfront-fusion/functions/date-and-time-functions.md#formatda) function. The correct format passed to the function as the second argument depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings.

To determine the correct format:

1. Choose **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Spreadsheet]** settings from the main menu to verify/set the locale.

1. Once you have verified/set the proper locale, determine the corresponding date and time format by choosing **[!UICONTROL Format]** > **[!UICONTROL Number]** from the main menu. The format is displayed next to the Date time menu item:

1. To compose the correct format that should be passed to the [!UICONTROL formatDate()] function, refer to the list of [Tokens for date and time formatting in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/functions/tokens-for-date-and-time-formatting.md).

**Example:** The use of `MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:ss` format for the United States locale:

![](assets/locale-time-350x83.png)

## Exploiting [!DNL Google Sheets] functions

If you miss a built-in function, but it is featured by [!DNL Google Sheets], you may exploit it. For more information, see [Use [!DNL Google Sheets] functions](../../workfront-fusion/functions/map-using-functions.md#exploiti) in [Map items using functions in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/functions/map-using-functions.md) .

## Keep [!DNL Google Sheets] from changing numbers into dates

You might find that a string of numbers that you are using as text is being interpreted as a date in a [!DNL Google] worksheet. For example, you type 1-2019, intending it as text, but Google interprets it as a date. You can pre-format the number as plain text to prevent this.

1. In [!DNL Google Sheets], highlight the column or cell containing the number or numbers.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Format]** > **[!UICONTROL Number]** > **[!UICONTROL Plain text]**.

Another workaround in [!DNL Workfront Fusion] is to type an apostrophe (') before a number, for example, '1-2019 or '1/47. The apostrophe does not display in the cell after the data is sent from [!DNL Workfront Fusion].
