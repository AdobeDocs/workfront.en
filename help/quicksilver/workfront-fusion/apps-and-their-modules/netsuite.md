In an [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] scenario, you can automate workflows that use [!DNL NetSuite], as well as connect it to multiple third-party applications and services.

If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

For information about modules, see [Modules in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

   <td role="rowheader">API tag</td> 
   <td>v1.0.10</td> 
  </tr>
 </tbody> 
 </table>

## Create a connection to NetSuite

To create a connection for your [!DNL NetSuite] modules:

1. In the [!DNL NetSuite] module, click **[!UICONTROL Add]** next to the Connection box.

## [!DNL NetSuite] modules and their fields

When you configure [!DNL NetSuite] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional [!DNL NetSuite] fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).

### [!UICONTROL Custom API Call]

This action module lets you make a custom authenticated call to the [!DNL NetSuite] API. This way, you can create a data flow automation that can't be accomplished by the other [!DNL NetSuite] modules.

The action is based on the entity type (Allocadia object type) you specify.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Connection]</td> 
   <td> <p>For instructions about connecting your [!DNL NetSuite] account to Workfront Fusion, see <a href="#create-a-connection-to-netsuite" class="MCXref xref">Create a connection to [!DNL NetSuite]</a> in this article.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL URL]</td> 
   <td> <p>Use the following URL format:</p> <p><code>https://{accountID}.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/rest/record/{version}/{resource}?{query-parameters}</code> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Method]</td> 
   <td> <p>Select the HTTP request method you need to configure the API call. For more information, see <a href="../../workfront-fusion/modules/http-request-methods.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">HTTP request methods in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Headers]</td> 
   <td> <p>Add the headers of the request in the form of a standard JSON object.</p> <p>For example, <code>{"Content-type":"application/json"}</code></p> <p>Workfront Fusion adds the authorization headers for you.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Query String]</td> 
   <td> <p>Add the query for the API call in the form of a standard JSON object.</p> <p>For example: <code>{"name":"something-urgent"}</code></p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Body]</td> 
   <td> <p>Add the body content for the API call in the form of a standard JSON object.</p> <p>Note:  <p>When using conditional statements such as <code>if</code> in your JSON, put the quotation marks outside of the conditional statement.</p> 
     <div class="example" data-mc-autonum="<b>Example: </b>"> 
      <p> <img src="assets/quotes-in-json-350x120.png" style="width: 350;height: 120;"> </p> 
     </div> </p> </td>
