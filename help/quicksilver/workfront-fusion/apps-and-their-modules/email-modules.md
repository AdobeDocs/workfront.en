## Connect your email to Workfront Fusion {#connect-your-email-to-workfront-fusion}

* [Connect to Google](#connect-to-google)
* [Connect to other email services (SMAP)](#connect-to-other-email-services-smap)

### Connect to [!DNL Google]

Use this option to create scenarios with email modules that require a connection to your [!DNL Google] account. This is an account with restricted scopes.

You can create a connection to your [!DNL Google] account directly from inside an Email module.

1. In any Email module, click **[!UICONTROL Add]** next to the [!UICONTROL Connection] field.
1. Select **[!DNL Google]** as the connection type.
1. Enter a name for the connection.
1. (Optional) Enter your [!UICONTROL [!DNL Google] Client ID] and [!UICONTROL Client Secret].
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** to create the connection and go back to the module.

### Connect to other email services (SMAP)

SMAP connection allows you to access your mailbox remotely and read or manipulate messages in your mailbox. SMAP connection is used by most of the Email modules.

1. In any Email module, click **[!UICONTROL Add]** next to the [!UICONTROL Connection] field.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Others (SMTP)]** as the connection type.
1. Enter a **[!UICONTROL Name]** for the connection.
1. Select your **[!UICONTROL Email provider]** from the list. If your email provider is not on the list, select Other.
1. Enter your **[!UICONTROL Email address]**, **[!UICONTROL Your full name]**, your **[!UICONTROL User name]**, and your **[!UICONTROL Password]**.
1. (Conditional) If your provider is not on the list, enter your **[!UICONTROL SMTP server]** and **[!UICONTROL Port]**, and specify whether you want to **[!UICONTROL Use a secure connection (TLS)]**. To find this information, check the [!UICONTROL Help] section for your mailbox. If you don't have this information available, contact your email service provider.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** to create the connection and go back to the module.

## [!UICONTROL Email] modules and their fields

When you configure [!UICONTROL Email] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

Some of the email fields might already contain data because you used them in another module in the scenario. See the email help documentation if you need information about them.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).

### Iterators

#### [!UICONTROL Iterate Attachments]

Iterates received attachments one by one.

The email iterator module lets you manage email attachments separately. For example, you can set up to watch emails to iterate the emails with attachments and receive alerts.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Source module]</td> 
   <td> <p>Select the module that outputs the email with the attachments that you want to iterate through.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

For more information about iterators, see [Iterator module in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/iterator-module.md).
