### Files

#### [!UICONTROL Download Translated File]

This module retrieves the content of a single translated file, contained within the specified project. If the requested file is not yet in Downland status, the content of the file may not yet be fully translated. If the file is in Download status, and you have successfully retrieved it, be sure to mark the file as complete using the `Cancel or Complete File` method.

#### [!UICONTROL Upload a File]

This module allows uploads of files for translation or for inclusion in a translation project as reference material. Uploads must be submitted using multipart/form-data and can contain more than one file. You specify the `ProjectOptionId` that should be used to evaluate the uploaded file(s). This determines whether each file you upload is a possible candidate for translation or must be handled as reference material. In the case of archives (`zip `, `rar`, `7z`, `tar` files) the app examines the contents of the archive and indicates whether the archive as a whole can be translated, or whether it contains a mixture of translatable and non-translatable files.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Uploading more than one file at a time is not recommended, because it can increase the impact of any failure.
