# [!DNL MariaDB] modules

In an [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] scenario, you can automate workflows that use [!DNL MariaDB], as well as connect it to multiple third-party applications and services.

If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

For information about modules, see [Modules in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

## Prerequisites

To use [!DNL MariaDB] modules, you must have a [!DNL MariaDB] account.

## Connect [!DNL MariaDB] to [!DNL Workfront Fusion] 

You can create a connection to your [!DNL MariaDB] account directly from inside a [!DNL MariaDB] module.

1. In any [!DNL MariaDB] module, click **[!UICONTROL Add]** next to the [!UICONTROL Connection] field.
1. Configure the following fields:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"> <p>[!UICONTROL Connection name]</p> </td> 
      <td> <p>Enter a name for the new connection.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Host]</td>

     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Port]</td>

    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** to create the connection and go back to the module.

## [!DNL MariaDB] Modules and their fields

When you configure [!DNL MariaDB] modules, [!DNL Workfront Fusion] displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional [!DNL MariaDB] fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).
