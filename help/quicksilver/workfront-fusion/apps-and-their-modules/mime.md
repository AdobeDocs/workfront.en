description: You can use MIME types in Adobe Workfront Fusion. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) types are labels that allow software to identify different types of data shared on the internet. Web servers and browsers use the MIME type to determine what should be done with a file. For example, a file with the MIME type text/html will be processed in a browser differently than a file with MIME type image/jpeg. MIME types function independent of operating system and hardware.

You can use MIME types in Adobe Workfront Fusion. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) types are labels that allow software to identify different types of data shared on the internet. Web servers and browsers use the MIME type to determine what should be done with a file. For example, a file with the MIME type `text/html` will be processed in a browser differently than a file with MIME type `image/jpeg`. MIME types function independent of operating system and hardware.
