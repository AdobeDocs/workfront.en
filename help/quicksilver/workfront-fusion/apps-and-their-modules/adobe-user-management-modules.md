## Adobe User Management modules and their fields

When you configure Adobe User Management modules, Workfront Fusion displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional Adobe User Management fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).
