# Adobe Photoshop modules

In an Adobe Workfront Fusion scenario, you can automate workflows that use Adobe Photoshop, as well as connect it to multiple third-party applications and services. Adobe Photoshop modules allow you to ,reate, read, update, or delete records,list all records of a given type, search records based on criteria you specify, or perform a custom API call to the Adobe Photoshop API.


If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

For information about modules, see [Modules in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

## Adobe Photoshop modules and their fields

When you configure Adobe Photoshop modules, Workfront Fusion displays the fields listed below. Along with these, additional Adobe Photoshop fields might display, depending on factors such as your access level in the app or service. A bolded title in a module indicates a required field.

If you see the map button above a field or function, you can use it to set variables and functions for that field. For more information, see [Map information from one module to another in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../workfront-fusion/mapping/map-information-between-modules.md).
