# [!DNL Google Drive] modules

The [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] [!DNL Google Drive] modules enable you to monitor, search, create, update, delete, and manage your files, folder, or shared drives in your [!DNL Google Drive].

In a [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] scenario, you can connect your [!DNL Google Drive] account to multiple third-party applications and services.

If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

For information about modules, see [Modules in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Unable to upload or update a file

There are several situations when uploading or updating a file fails:

* The uploaded file is too big and exceeds the maximum file size limit allowed for your [!DNL Google Drive] plan or you have exceeded your [!DNL Google Drive] storage limit. You can either upgrade your storage plan or delete existing files from the [!DNL Google Drive] service.
* The selected folder where the file was to be uploaded to no longer exists. The scenario stops and it is then necessary to select a target folder again.

## Search for files

In the module List files in a folder you can use your own query which consists of these parts:

* **[!UICONTROL Field]** - Attribute of the file that is being searched, for example, the attribute `name` of the file.

* **[!UICONTROL Operator]** - Test that is performed on the data to provide a match, for example, `contains`.

* **[!UICONTROL Value]** - The content of the attribute that is tested, for example, the name of the file `My cool document`.

Combine clauses with the conjunctions `and` or `or`, and negate the query with `not`.

Consider the following about operators in these fields:

* The `contains` operator only performs prefix matching for a `title`.

   For example, the title "HelloWorld" matches for `title contains 'Hello'` but not for `title contains 'World'`.

* The `contains` operator only performs matching on entire string tokens for `fullText`.

   For example, if the full text of a doc contains the string "HelloWorld" only the query `fullText contains 'HelloWorld'` returns a result. Queries such as `fullText contains 'Hello'` would not return results in this scenario.

* The `contains` operator matches on an exact alphanumeric phrase if it is surrounded by double quotes.

   For example, if the `fullText` of a doc contains the string "Hello there world", then the query `fullText contains '"Hello there"'` returns a result, but the query `fullText contains '"Hello world"'` does not.

   Furthermore, because the search is alphanumeric, if the `fullText` of a doc contains the string "Hello_world", then the query `fullText contains '"Hello world"'` returns a result.

* Fields of `type` date are currently not comparable to each other, only to constant dates.

For compound clauses, you can use parentheses to group clauses together. For example:
`modifiedDate > '2012-06-04T12:00:00' and (mimeType contains 'image/' or mimeType contains 'video/')` This search returns all files with an image or video MIME type that their last modification was after June 4, 2012. Because `and` and `or` operators are evaluated from left to right, without parentheses, the above example would return only images modified after June 4, 2012, but would return all videos, even those before June 4, 2012.

### Examples 

All examples on this page show the unencoded `<q>q</q>` parameter, where `title = 'hello'` is encoded as `title+%3d+%27hello%27`. Client libraries handle this encoding automatically.

* Search for files with the name "hello"
   <pre>title = 'hello'</pre>
* Search for folders using the folder-specific MIME type
   <pre>mimeType = 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'</pre>
* Search for files that are not folders
   <pre>mimeType != 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'</pre>
* Search for files with a name containing the words "hello" and "goodbye"
   <pre>title contains 'hello' and [!UICONTROL name] contains 'goodbye'</pre>
* Search for files with a name that does not contain the word "hello"
   <pre>not title contains 'hello'</pre>
* Search for files containing the word "hello" in the content
   <pre>fullText contains 'hello'</pre>
* Search for files not containing the word "hello" in the content
   <pre>not fullText contains 'hello'</pre>
* Search for files containing the exact phrase "hello world" in the content
   <pre>fullText contains '"hello world"'fullText contains '"hello_world"'</pre>
* Search for files with a query containing the "\" character (e.g., "\authors")
   <pre>fullText contains '\\authors'</pre>
* Search for files writeable by the user "test@example.org"
   <pre>'test@example.org' in [!DNL writers]</pre>
* Search for the ID `1234567` in the `parents` collection. This finds all files and folders located directly in the folder whose ID is `1234567`.
   <pre>'1234567' in [!UICONTROL parents]</pre>
* Search for the alias ID `appDataFolder` in the `parents` collection. This finds all files and folders located directly under the [Application Data folder](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v2/appdata).
   <pre>'appDataFolder' in parents</pre>
* Search for files writeable by the users "test@example.org" and "test2@example.org"
   <pre>'test@example.org' in writers and 'test2@example.org' in writers</pre>
* Search for files containing the text "important" which are in the trash
   <pre>fullText contains 'important' and trashed = true</pre>
* Search for files modified after June 4th 2012
   <pre>modifiedDate > '2012-06-04T12:00:00' // default time zone is UTC</pre><pre>modifiedDate > '2012-06-04T12:00:00-08:00'</pre>
* Search for files shared with the authorized user with "hello" in the name
   <pre>sharedWithMe and title contains 'hello'</pre>
* Search for files with a [custom file property](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v2/properties) named `additionalID` with the value `8e8aceg2af2ge72e78`.
   <pre>properties has { key='additionalID' and value='8e8aceg2af2ge72e78' and visibility='PRIVATE' }</pre>
