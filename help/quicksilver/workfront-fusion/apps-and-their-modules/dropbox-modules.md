#### [!UICONTROL Make an API Call]

This action module lets you make a custom authenticated call to the [!DNL Dropbox] API. This way, you can create a data flow automation that can't be accomplished by the other [!DNL Dropbox] modules.

## Common problems

* [Unable to upload or update a file](#unable-to-upload-or-update-a-file)
* [Image referenced via a shared link does not render](#image-referenced-via-a-shared-link-does-not-render)

### Unable to upload or update a file 

There are several situations when uploading or updating a file fails:

* The uploaded file is too big and exceeds the maximum file size allowed for your [!DNL Dropbox] plan, or you have used all of your [!DNL Dropbox] account's storage quota. You must delete existing files from your [!DNL Dropbox] account or upgrade your plan.
* The previously selected folder, to which the file is being uploaded to, no longer exists. The scenario stops and you must select the target folder again.

### Image referenced via a shared link does not render

The URL returned by the [!UICONTROL Dropbox] >[!UICONTROL Create a shared link] does not link directly to an image, but to a [!DNL Dropbox] page. To force the image to download, replace the trailing `?dl=0` with `?dl=1`. To force the image to render (for example, in a Web browser or in Facebook Messenger), append `&raw=1` to the URL.

If you need to get the direct or raw link of your image for your website or for other [!DNL Workfront Fusion] modules, you must modify the initial shared URL in the following way:

Original URL:

`https://www.dropbox.com/s/ia8qtvs20f3a5ux/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-15%20at%204.21.11%20PM.png?dl=0`

1. Replace `www` with `dl`.
1. Remove `?dl=0`.

Final URL:

`https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ia8qtvs20f3a5ux/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-15%20at%204.21.11%20PM.png`

To automatically modify the URL, you can use the `replace()` function twice:

* Replace www with dl

   ![](assets/www-to-dl-350x32.png)

* And to remove ?dl=0

   ![](assets/remove-dl0-350x33.png)

To do it in one step, combine these functions:

![](assets/replace-both-350x47.png)

You can also copy it and paste it into the field. Replace `1.url` with the URL.

```
{{replace(replace(1.url; "?dl=0"; ""); "www"; "dl")}}
```
