# [!DNL Salesforce] modules

In an Adobe Workfront Fusion scenario, you can automate workflows that use [!DNL Salesforce], as well as connect it to to multiple third-party applications and services.

If you need instructions on creating a scenario, see [Create a scenario in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).

For information about modules, see [Modules in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](../../workfront-fusion/modules/modules.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Not all editions of [!DNL Salesforce] have API access. For details, see the information about [!DNL Salesforce] editions with API access on the [!DNL Salesforce] Community site.
>* For information on specific errors returned from the [!DNL Salesforce] API, see the [!DNL Salesforce] API docs. You can also check the status of the [!DNL Salesforce] API for any possible service outages.
>

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td>
  <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td>
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan], [!UICONTROL Work]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] license**</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront Fusion] for Work Automation and Integration] </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>Your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

For information on [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md).

## Prerequisites

To use [!DNL Salesforce] modules, you must have a [!DNL Salesforce] account.

## About searching for [!DNL Salesforce] objects

When searching for objects, you can either enter individual search words or create a more complex query using wild cards and operators:

* Use the asterisk wild card (\*) as a substitute for zero or more characters. For example, a search for Ca\* finds items that start with Ca
* Use a question mark wild card (?) as a substitute for a single character. For example, a search for Jo?n finds items with the term John or Joan but not Jon
* Use the quotation marks operator (" ") to find an exact phrase match. For example: "Monday meeting"

For more information about search possibilities, see the [!DNL Salesforce] developer documentation about SOQL and SOSL.

## [!DNL Salesforce] modules and their fields

* [Triggers](#triggers) 
* [Actions](#actions) 
* [Searches](#searches)

### Triggers 

* [[!UICONTROL Watch for Records]](#uicontrol-watch-for-records) 
* [[!UICONTROL Watch Outbound Messages]](#uicontrol-watch-outbound-messages) 
* [[!UICONTROL Watch a field]](#uicontrol-watch-a-field)

#### [!UICONTROL Watch for Records]

This trigger module executes a scenario when a record in an object is created or updated. The module returns all standard fields associated with the record or records, along with any custom fields and values that the connection accesses. You can map this information in subsequent modules in the scenario.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Connection]</td> 
   <td> <p>For instructions about connecting your [!DNL Salesforce] account to [!DNL Workfront Fusion], see <a href="../../workfront-fusion/connections/connect-to-fusion-general.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Create a connection to [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] - Basic instructions</a></p> </td>

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

#### [!UICONTROL Watch Outbound Messages] 

This trigger module executes a scenario when someone sends a message. The module returns all standard fields associated with the record or records, along with any custom fields and values that the connection accesses. You can map this information in subsequent modules in the scenario.

This module requires some extra setup:

1. Go to the [!DNL Salesforce] setup page.

   To access the setup page, locate and click the button labeled "[!UICONTROL Setup]" in the upper-right hand corner of the [!DNL Salesforce] account. From the [!DNL Salesforce] setup page, locate the "[!UICONTROL Quick Find / Search]" bar on the left hand side. Search for "[!UICONTROL Workflow Rules]." 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Workflow Rules]**. 
1. On the the [!UICONTROL Workflow Rules] page that appears, click **[!UICONTROL New Rule]** and select the object type the rule will apply to (such as "[!UICONTROL Opportunity]" if you are monitoring updates to Opportunity records).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
1. Set a rule name, evaluation criteria, and rule criteria, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]** and **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.
1. From the newly created Workflow rule, click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**..
1. From the **[!UICONTROL Add Workflow Action]** drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL New Outbound Message]**.

1. Specify name, description, Endpoint URL, and fields you want to include in the new outbound message, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   The **[!UICONTROL Endpoint URL]** field contains the URL provided on the [!DNL Salesforce] [!UICONTROL Outbound Message] in [!DNL Workfront Fusion].

1. Configure a scenario beginning with the [!UICONTROL Outbound Message] event. 

1. Click the **</>** icon in the bottom right and copy the provided URL.
1. Return to the **[!UICONTROL Workflow Rules]** page, locate the newly created rule, then click **[!UICONTROL Activate]**.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.

#### [!UICONTROL Create a Record]

This action module creates a new record in an object.

The module allows you to select which of the object's fields are available in the module. This reduces the number of fields you must scroll through when setting up the module.

The module returns the ID of the  record and any associated fields, along with any custom fields and values that the connection accesses. You can map this information in subsequent modules in the scenario.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.

<table style="table-layout:auto">

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

#### [!UICONTROL Read a Record]

This action module reads data from a single object in [!DNL Salesforce].

You specify the ID of the record.

The module returns the ID of the record and any associated fields, along with any custom fields and values that the connection accesses. You can map this information in subsequent modules in the scenario.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.

For example: <code>https://eu5.salesforce.com/&lt;object ID&gt;</code></p> </td>
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

#### [!UICONTROL Delete a Record]

This action module deletes an existing record in an object.

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

#### [!UICONTROL Custom API Call]

This action module lets you make a custom authenticated call to the [!DNL Salesforce] API. This way, you can create a data flow automation that can't be accomplished by the other [!DNL Salesforce] modules.

The module returns the following:

* **[!UICONTROL Status Code]** (number): This indicates the success or failure of your HTTP request. These are standard codes that you can look up on the internet.
* **[!UICONTROL Headers]** (object): A more detailed context for the response/status code that doesn't relate to the output body. Not all headers that appear in a response header are response headers, so some might not be useful to you.

  The response headers depend on the HTTP request you chose when configuring the module.

* **[!UICONTROL Body]** (object): Depending on the HTTP request you chose when configuring the module, you may receive some data back. That data, such as the data from a [!UICONTROL GET] request, is contained in this object.

When you are configuring this module, the following fields display.
