# Manage Adobe Workfront Planning email notifications

{{planning-important-intro}}

You can receive email notifications from Workfront Planning when the following scenarios exist:

* Someone tags you in a record comment
   
   For information about tagging others in a record comment, see [Manage record comments](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/manage-record-comments.md). 
* Someone asks for your permission to access a view or a workspace
* Someone confirms your access has been granted for a view or a workspace <!--Isk confirmed that there is nno email for denying access but did not test-->
