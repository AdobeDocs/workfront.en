# Formula fields overview

<!--when we release permissions to RECORDS and we release referring lookup fields in a formula field, update considerations to say that lookup fields from linked records depends on the permissions to the record; if they have no permissions to view a linked record, they won't be able to use that records's lookup fields in a formula-->

{{planning-important-intro}}

You can create custom fields in Adobe Workfront Planning by referring to existing fields and connecting them in a Formula-type field.

Formula fields generate a new value using existing values from other fields in a record type and a function that indicates how the existing values should be calculated. 

For information, see the "Formula" section in the article [Create fields](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/create-fields.md).

## Considerations about formula fields

* Formula fields reference fields that belong to the same record type. 
* You can reference fields from other record types only when you connect another record type to the one you're creating a formula field for. 
* You cannot change the Field type of a Formula field after you save it. 
* You can update the calculation of a formula field after you save it, and the results of the calculation update automatically for all the records of the same type. 
* You must add the fields you reference in formulas as they display in the Workfront Planning interface. 
* You can reference only fields that display in the table view of a record type or on the record details page. 
* You can define the format for the value of a formula calculation by choosing from the following format options:

   * Text
   * Number
   * Percent
   * Currency
   * Tags
   * Date

   For more information, see the "Formula" section in the article [Create fields](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/create-fields.md).

## Supported formulas

Adobe Workfront Planning formula fields support all expressions from the Workfront calculated fields. For a list of Workfront expressions, see [Overview of calculated data expressions](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-data-expressions.md).

In addition, we support the following expressions for Workfront Planning formula fields:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Expression</th> 
   <th>Explanation and example</th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>ARRAYJOIN</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>Returns concatenated string by delimiter.</p> <p>The expression is formatted as follows:
   
   <code>ARRAYJOIN(delimiter,array)</code>
   </p>
   </td></tr>

   <tr> 
   <td><strong>ARRAYUNIQUE</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>Returns array with unique values.</p> <p>The expression is formatted as follows:

   <code>ARRAYUNIQUE(array)</code>
   </p>
   </td></tr>
     <tr> 
   <td><strong>ID</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>Returns the ID of a record. Each record has a unique ID.</p> <p>The expression is formatted as follows:
   
   <code>{ID}</code>
   </p>
   </td></tr>
  
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>SETTIMEZONE</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>Sets the timezone of a date and time to a specific timezone.</p> <p>The expression is formatted as follows:
   
   <code>SETTIMEZONE(date,'America/Los_Angeles')</code>
   </p>
   </td></tr>
   
   <tr> 
   <td><strong>WEEKOFYEAR</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>Returns the week number in a year. Optionally, you can indicate which day the week starts on (use 1 for Sunday, or 2 for Monday). If omitted, weeks start on Sunday, by default.</p> <p>The expression is formatted as follows:
   
   <code>WEEKOFYEAR(date,2)</code>
      or
   <code>WEEKOFYEAR(date)</code>
   </p>
