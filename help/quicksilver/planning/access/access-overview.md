## Share the Planning area in the Main Menu with others

<!--First, contact your account manager to obtain access to the current Workfront Planning program.--> 

After your organization has been enrolled in the Workfront Planning program, you can add the Planning area to the Main Menu of all users by using a layout template. 

1. Log in to **Workfront** as a Workfront administrator.  

1. Add the **Planning** icon ![](assets/planning-icon.png) to the **Main Menu** using a **Layout Template**. 
    
    For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

1. Assign the layout template to the users that you want to have access to Workfront Planning. 

    For information, see [Assign users to a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md).

    All users assigned to the template can now access Workfront Planning in their Main Menu. 
    
    Users can start creating workspaces, records types, records, and fields.

## Grant access 

There are no Workfront access controls for Workfront Planning. 

Users with any type of Workfront license can access Workfront Planning. 

<!--For information about granting access in Workfront, see [Create and modify custom access levels](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md). -->

## Grant permissions

You must give users permissions to Workfront Planning workspaces and views that you create in order for them to access them. 

For more information, see [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/sharing-permissions-overview.md).

Your Adobe Workfront license type works in conjunction with your Workfront Planning permissions to give you access to view, contribute, or manage Workfront Planning objects.

For information about how license types affect permission levels for Workfront Planning objects, see [License type overview when using Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/license-type-overview.md).
