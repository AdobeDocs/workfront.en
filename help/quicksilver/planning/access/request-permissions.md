## Request and grant permissions to a view or workspace

When someone shares with you a link to a workspace or a view where you do not have access, the following scenario exists:

1. Click the link shared with you for the view or the workspace. 
    
    A **You have no access** page displays to inform you that you do not have access to the view or the workspace.

1. (Conditional) If the link shared is for a view for a workspace where you have access, click **Open with existing view**. If you have permissions to access the workspace, the record type page opens in the default view. 

1. (Optional) Add a personalized message in the box available.

1. Click **Request access**. 

    All users with Manage permissions to the view or the workspace receive an email notification for your request.
1. Users that received the email notification for the access request go to the view or the workspace and grant you permissions.
1. You receive an email notification that notifies you that you have been granted the access to the view or workspace. You can access the view or workspace from the email notification.
