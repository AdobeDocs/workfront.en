## Request permissions to a view or workspace

Requesting permissions to a view is similar to requesting permission to a workspace. 

When someone shares with you a link to a workspace or a view where you do not have access:

1. Click the link shared with you for the view or the workspace. 
    
    A **You have no access** page displays to inform you that you do not have access to the view or the workspace.

1. (Conditional) If the link shared is for a view for a workspace where you have access, click **Open with existing view**. If you have permissions to access the workspace, the record type page opens in the default view.

1. (Optional and conditional) If you do not have permissions to view the workspace, add a personalized message in the box available, then click **Request access**. 

    All users with Manage permissions to the view or the workspace receive the following notifications for the access request:
      * An in-app notification
         ![](assets/in-app-notification-for-access-request.png)
      * An email notification
         ![](assets/email-notification-for-access-request.png)
   
   For information about granting permissions to views and workspaces, see the following articles:

      * [Share views](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-views.md)
      * [Share workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-workspaces.md)
1. (Conditional) When the view or workspace manager grants you permissions to the view or workspace, you receive an email notification with a confirmation that the permissions were granted or denied. <!--check this - I was not able to test this-->
