# Request permissions to a view or a workspace

You can request permissions to a view or a workspace when someone shares a link with you to the view or the workspace to which you do not have access. 

Requesting permissions to a view is similar to requesting permissions to a workspace. 

This article describes how to request access to a view or a workspace when someone shares a link with you and you cannot access the shared page. 

For information about granting permissions to views and workspaces, see the following articles:

## Request permissions to a view or workspace

Requesting permissions to a view is similar to requesting permission to a workspace. 

When someone shares with you a link to a workspace or a view where you do not have access:

1. Click the link shared with you for the view or the workspace. 
    
    A **You have no access** page displays to inform you that you do not have access to the view or the workspace.

1. (Conditional) If the link shared is for a view for a workspace where you have access, click **Open with existing view**. If you have permissions to access the workspace, the record type page opens in the default view.

1. (Optional and conditional) If you do not have permissions to view the workspace, add a personalized message in the box available, then click **Request access**. 

    All users with Manage permissions to the view or the workspace receive the following notifications for the access request:
      * An in-app notification
         ![](assets/in-app-notification-for-access-request.png)
      * An email notification
         ![](assets/email-notification-for-access-request.png)
   
1. (Conditional) When the view or workspace manager grants you permissions to the view or workspace, you receive an email notification and an in-app notification with a confirmation that the permission was granted. <!--check this - I was not able to test this, but Isk confirmed.-->
