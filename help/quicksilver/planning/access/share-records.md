# Share records

{{planning-important-intro}}

To collaborate with other users, you can share records with others in Adobe Workfront Planning. 

You can share an Adobe Workfront Planning record in the following ways: 

* Share a link to the record. 

    For more information, see [Share records using a link](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/share-records.md).

* Share all records in a workspace with other users by sharing the workspace and the record type.

   For more information see the following articles:

   * [Share a workspace](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-workspaces.md)

   * [Share a record type](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-record-types.md)

* Share a record using the **Share** option.

    This article describes how you can share a record with others using the **Share** option. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Users with access to a workspace automatically gain at least View permissions to all the records in the workspace. 
>Sharing views does not give users permissions to records. Only sharing workspaces can grant users permissions to record types and records. 
>
>For general information about sharing objects in Workfront Planning, also see [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/sharing-permissions-overview.md).
