# Share workspaces

{{planning-important-intro}}

You can share a workspace with others to ensure collaboration when working in Adobe Workfront Planning. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Granting permissions to a workspace does not give other users permissions to the views on the record type pages. You must grant permissions to individual views in a record type page to share them with other users. For information, see [Share a view](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-views.md).

## Share permissions to a workspace

The following users can share a workspace with other users:

* System administrators can share all workspaces, including the ones that they did not create.
* All other users can share only workspaces for which they have Manage permissions to. 

To share a workspace with others: 

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Open the workspace you want to share, then click **Share** in the upper-right corner of the screen.

1. Select one of the following permission levels from the drop-down menu: 
    * View
    * Contribute
    * Manage

        For information about permission levels and what actions users can perform for each level, see [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/sharing-permissions-overview.md).
1. Click **Copy link** to copy a link to the workspace to your clipboard. 
1. Share the copied link with others. Users who receive the link must be active users and log in to Workfront to be able to access the workspace. 
1. Click **Save**.
