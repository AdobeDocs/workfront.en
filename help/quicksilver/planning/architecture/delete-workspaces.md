In Adobe Workfront Planning, workspaces are centralized locations for teams to plan work. For more information, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md). 

You can delete workspaces that are no longer relevant. 

We recommend recreating some or all of the record types, records, fields, and views associated with the workspace that you want to delete in another workspace before deleting it.

## Considerations about deleting workspaces

* When you delete workspaces, all the record types, records, their fields, and views are also deleted. 
* Deleted workspaces and the information they contain cannot be recovered. 

## Delete a workspace

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. (Conditional) If you are a Workfront administrator, click one of the following:

   * **Workspaces I'm on** to access workspaces you created
   * **All workspaces** to access workspaces shared with you or workspaces you created

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You cannot delete the workspaces on the **Sample workspaces** tab. We recommend using the multi-workspace template bundle to create workspaces similar to those on the Sample workspace tab. For information, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md).

1. (Optional) Click **Show all** to display additional workspaces. The **Show all** link displays only when you have more than two rows of workspace cards.
1. (Optional) ClicK **Show less** to limit the number of workspaces that display on the screen. 
1. To delete a workspace, do one of the following:

   * Hover over the workspace card, then click the **More** menu ![More menu](assets/more-menu.png) in the upper-right corner of the card
      Or 
   * Click the **search** icon ![Search icon](assets/search-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of the Workspaces page to search for a workspace by name and click a workspace card to open the workspace, then click the **More** menu ![More menu](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the workspace name.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can use the following keyboard combination to open the global search box from any Workfront Planning page and search for workspaces:
   >
   >* CTRL+K for Windows
   >* ⌘+K for Mac
   
1. Click **Delete**.

   ![Permanently delete workspace confirmation](assets/permanently-delete-workspace-confirmation.png)

1. Type "**delete**" in the space provided, then click **Permanently delete**. This is not case sensitive. 

    The workspace is deleted and cannot be recovered. Any record types, records, fields, and views associated with them are also deleted. <!--ensure this is right at or before GA-->
