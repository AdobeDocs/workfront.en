# Delete workspaces

{{planning-important-intro}}

In Adobe Workfront Planning, workspaces are centralized locations for teams to plan work. For more information, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md). 

You can delete workspaces that are no longer relevant. 

We recommend recreating some or all of the record types, records, fields, and views associated with the workspace that you want to delete in another workspace before deleting it.

## Access requirements

>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level.

## Considerations about deleting workspaces

* When you delete workspaces, all the record types, records, their fields, and views are also deleted. 
* Deleted workspaces and the information they contain cannot be recovered. 

## Delete a workspace

{{step1-to-maestro}}

This opens the last workspace you accessed. 

1. (Optional) Expand the downward-pointing arrow to the right of an existing workspace name and select the workspace that you want to delete. 
1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) next to the workspace name, then click **Delete**.
<!--1. Type "**delete**" in the space provided, then click **Permanently delete**. **********AND DELETE THE STEP BELPW EXCEPT FOR THE LAST SENTENCE***********-->

1. Click **Delete** to confirm.

    The workspace is deleted and cannot be recovered. Any record types, records, fields, and views associated with them are also deleted. <!--ensure this is right after closed beta-->
