## Create a workspace

You can create a workspace and add record types to it to organize your objects in Workfront Planning. For more informaton about editing a workspace, see [Edit workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/edit-workspaces.md).

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click **Create workspace**

   The Create workspace box displays. You can create a workspace from scratch or create it using one of the available templates.  
    
1. (Optional and conditional) Click **Preview** inside any of the following predefined workspace templates:

    * Basic: Marketing Management
    * Advanced: Marketing Management
    * Enterprise: Marketing Management
    * Sales management
    * Product management
    
    The template preview box opens. 
    
    There is an indication of what operational record types, taxonomies and how many fields are associated with each template.

    ![](assets/previewing-a-workspace-template.png)

    For information about Workfront Planning workspace templates, see [List of workspace templates](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/workspace-templates.md).

1. From the template preview box, click **Use template** to start creating the workspace from the selected template

    Or

    Click **Back**, then click **New workspace** to create a workspace from scratch.

    One for the following types of workspaces is created:
    
    * An empty workspace named **Untitled Workspace** where you can start adding record types manually, when you create a workspace from scratch. 
    * A workspace named after the template you selected that is populated with sample record types. You can further customize the record types and the workspace.
     
   For Workfront administrators, the new workspace displays on the **Workspaces I'm on** tab.

   For all other users who can create workspaces, the new workspace displays in the **Workspaces** area.

1. Click inside the name of the workspace in the header of the new workspace to rename it, then press Enter. 

1. (Optional and conditional) If you created the workspace from a template, click inside the name of the **Operational Record Types** or **Taxonomies** sections 

   Or 

   Hover the name of a section, then click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png), then click **Rename** to rename the section. 

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >You can rename any section from any workspace, even if you didn't create the section.
