# Edit workspaces

{{planning-important-intro}}

In Adobe Workfront Planning, workspaces are centralized locations for teams to plan work. 

A workspace is a collection of record types used by a team and represents the team's work lifecycle. You can fully customize workspaces in Adobe Workfront Planning. 

For information about creating workspaces, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md). 

All changes you make to a workspace are visible to all those who have at least View permissions to the workspace.
