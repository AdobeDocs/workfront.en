# Create workspace hierarchies

As a workspace manager, you can create multiple workspace hierarchies between the record types in Adobe Workfront Planning. 

After you connect record types in a workspace and create a hierarchy, record types are connected to one another, with one record type designated as the parent and up to 6 other record types configured as children. <!--asking Robert how many we can have in one hierarchy; I think 7 total but not sure-->

Hierarchies will generate breadcrumbs for the record types and records <!--ensure this is the case: does the breadcrumb show for both the RT and the record??--> that display in their headers. This way, users know where they are in the hierarchy at any stage of their workflow. 

For general information about hierarchies and breadcrumbs, see [Hierarchy and breadcrumb overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/hierarchy-and-breadcrumb-overview.md). 


## Access requirements
