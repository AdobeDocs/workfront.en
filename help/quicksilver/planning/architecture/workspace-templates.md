{{planning-important-intro}}

In Adobe Workfront Planning, a workspace is a collection of record types used by a team and represents the team's work lifecycle. 

Workfront Planning comes with a set of templates to get you started with basic record types and fields when you are building your workspace. For information about creating workspaces, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md). 

This article describes the workspace templates available in Adobe Workfront Planning.
