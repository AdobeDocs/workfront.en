# List of workspace templates

{{maestro-important-intro}}

In Adobe Workfront Planning, a workspace is a collection of record types used by a team and represents the team's work lifecycle. 

Workfront Planning comes with a set of templates to get you started with basic record types and fields when you are building your workspace. For information about creating workspaces, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md). 

This article describes the workspace templates available in Adobe Workfront Planning. 

## Considerations about Adobe Workfront Planning templates

* Each template comes with a set of record types. For information, see [Record types overview](/help/quicksilver/maestro/architecture/overview-of-record-types.md).
* The record types in each template are organized in the following sections:

    * Operational Record Types
    * Taxonomies
* Each record type comes with a set of fields. Some of these fields are connections to other Workfront Planning record types. 
* You can customize any template and add more record types and fields to the existing ones.
