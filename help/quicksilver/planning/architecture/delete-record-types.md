# Delete record types

{{planning-important-intro}}

You can delete record types when they are no longer relevant. 

However, deleting record types also deletes all information associated with the record types. For more information, see the [Considerations when deleting record types](#considerations-when-deleting-record-types) section in this article. 

For information about record types, see [Record types overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/overview-of-record-types.md).

<!-- last sentence might need to be deleted when we can recover or replace deleted record types-->

## Considerations when deleting record types

<!--check this and ensure these are still true - some things might change with / after closed beta-->

* You can delete only record types from workspaces to which you have Manage permissions.
* Deleting record types removes the following information associated with them:

   * All records of that type.
   * All fields associated with the record type. 
   * All views (including filters, groupings, and sorting criteria) of the record type.
* The record type is removed from all users accessing the workspace.
* You cannot recover deleted record types or their information. 
* We recommend recreating the fields and the records associated with the record type that you want to delete on another record type before deleting them.

## Delete record types

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click the workspace whose record types you want to delete, 

    Or

    From a workspace, expand the downward-pointing arrow to the right of an existing workspace name, search for a workspace, then select it when it displays in the list.

    The workspace opens and the record types display. 
1. Do one of the following:

   * Hover over the record type card, click the **More** menu, then **Delete**. 
   * Click the card for the record type that you want to delete, and from the record type page, click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record type name, then click **Delete**. 

   ![](assets/permanently-delete-record-type-confirmation.png)

1. Type **delete** in the confirmation box, then click **Permanently delete**. This is not case sensitive. 
   
   The selected record type, along with their fields, associated records, and views are deleted and cannot be recovered.
