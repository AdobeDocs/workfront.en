## Enrolling in the Beta program for the Planning Onboarding Assistant

<!--edit this Or create a new article under Beta programs?? -->

## Considerations about the Planning Onboarding Assistant

<!--these are from the AI Assistant - edit these

* The AI Assistant must be enabled for your organization before it is available for users in your company. For information, see [AI Assistant overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-overview.md). 
* After Workfront has enabled the AI Assistant for your organization, it is available for the main Workfront administrator. For information, see [Configure basic information for your system](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-basic-info.md). 

* The Workfront administrator must enable the AI Assistant for all other users. For more information, see [Enable or disable AI Assistant](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/enable-or-disable-assistant.md). 

* The AI Assistant works in the context of each page. The requests you are submitting for the AI Assistant must reference functionality that is available in the page that you have open. 

* The actions performed by the AI Assistant in the Planning area are in the context of your Workfront Planning permissions and your Workfront access level. For information, see the following articles: 

    * [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/sharing-permissions-overview.md)
    * [License type overview when using Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/license-type-overview.md)

* Changes made by the AI Assistant on the user's behalf are tracked in the record's history panel. 

* You can use commands to undo your actions. For example, you can type "Undo last change" to revert your change. 

* When creating, updating, or deleting an object through AI Assistant, AI Assistant displays the intended actions and asks for confirmation. You can then confirm or cancel the actions.
