## Enrolling in the Closed Beta program for the Planning Designer

<!--edit this Or create a new article under Beta programs?? -->

Currently, you can request to participate in the Closed Beta program for the Planning Designer. 

## Considerations about the Planning Designer

<!--these are from the AI Assistant - edit these-->

* In order to use the Planning Designer, you first need to enable the AI Assistant for your organization. The following must be enabled for the AI Assistant to be available to everyone in your organization: 

    * The AI Assistant must be enabled for your organization before it is available for users in your company. For information, see [AI Assistant overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-overview.md). 
    * After Workfront has enabled the AI Assistant for your organization, it is available for the main Workfront administrator. For information, see [Configure basic information for your system](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-basic-info.md). 

    * The Workfront administrator must enable the AI Assistant for all other users. For more information, see [Enable or disable AI Assistant](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/enable-or-disable-assistant.md). 

    * The AI Assistant works in the context of each page. The requests you are submitting for the AI Assistant must reference functionality that is available in the page that you have open. 

* To use the Planning Designer, a system administrator must enable it in the System Preferences area of your Setup. 

* The actions performed by the AI Assistant in the Planning area are in the context of your Workfront Planning permissions and your Workfront access level. For information, see the following articles: 

    * [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/sharing-permissions-overview.md)
    * [License type overview when using Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/license-type-overview.md)

* Changes made by the AI Assistant on the user's behalf are tracked in the record's history panel. 

* You can use commands to undo your actions. For example, you can type "Undo last change" to revert your change. 

* When creating, updating, or deleting an object through AI Assistant, AI Assistant displays the intended actions and asks for confirmation. You can then confirm or cancel the actions.

## Functionality currently available for the Planning Designer

<!--edit these- they are from the Ai Assistant: 

Currently, the AI Assistant is available in the Planning area of Workfront for the following pages:

* Workspace page
* Record type page
* Record page

You can use the AI Assistant to perform the following actions, at this time:

* Search for records. You can search by information contained in any record fields. 
* Create records. An ID with a link to the new record displays after the record is created. You can specify the fields you want to update during the creation process, like dates or description. 
* Create records based on a document that you upload. Workfront supports the following document formats for the AI Assistant:

    PPTX, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPT, DOC, TXT, and most image formats
* Update fields for the records you see on the screen
* Delete records
* Restore records that you just deleted

-->

You can use either the Planning Designer or the AI Assistant to perform any of the following actions: 

* Create and configure workspaces 

* Create record types 

* Design fields or formula fields 

* Create, delete, duplicate, and restore records 

* Edit, update, append a field in a record 

* Link records to other records 

* Access record change history 

* Build custom views 

* Create records by importing a document. Creating records from an imported document is available only in the Planning Designer, and not in the AI Assistant. <!--add information about supported files-->

    <!--* Generate thumbnail and over image for a record (not available yet, maybe Q2) -->
