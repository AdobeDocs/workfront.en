## Introduction to Adobe Workfront Planning

Adobe Workfront Planning is a new offering from Adobe Workfront. The purpose of Workfront Planning is to unlock comprehensive visibility into the operational details of an organization, and answer critical business questions at each stage of the work management lifecycle. 

Teams and leadership need clear answers to questions like:  

* How many campaigns are we running in EMEA for Q4?
* Do we have any audience overlaps between concurrent campaigns?
* How well are the awareness programs doing right now?
* What do the assets look like for a particular campaign? Which of them must still be approved?

To answer these questions, leadership needs a solution that can provide a holistic view of every stage of work from planning to execution, from delivery to measuring the results. Currently, organizations have tools that can cover some parts of the process, but many do not have good connections to all phases of work, nor can they reliably provide results.  

The following are some of the main capabilities:

* Solve the problem of managing work across all stages and for all the stakeholders that participate in the work process.  
* Fully customize your workflows, from deciding what object types (or record types) your organization uses to configuring how these objects link to one another.  
* Link to object types from other systems, creating a coherent framework for all your processes.

## Enable Adobe Workfront Planning for the users in your Workfront instance

Your organization must enroll in the Adobe Workfront Planning program before you can access its capabilities. Your account representative should have given you information about enrolling in this program, if you qualify. 

For more information about granting access to and enabling others to use Workfront Planning, see [Access overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/access-overview.md). 

## Adobe Workfront Planning terminology

Although Workfront Planning is part of Workfront, it comes with proprietary concepts and terminology. Ensure you are familiar with the new concepts before embarking on setting up Workfront Planning for your organization. 

The framework for Workfront Planning is fully customizable. You can create all record types, their attributes, and any fields associated with them to suit the exact needs of your organization. 

There are limitations for how many Workfront Planning objects you can create. For more information, see [Adobe Workfront Planning object limitations overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/general/limitations-overview.md). 

The following are the main Workfront Planning objects and concepts: 

* **Workspace**: A collection of record types that define the operational lifecycle of a certain organization. A workspace is the work frame of an organizational unit. 

    One Workfront instance can have a maximum of 1,000 workspaces.

    ![](assets/marketing-workspace-with-record-type-taxonomies-opening-page.png) 
    
    For more information, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md). 

* **Record Type**: The object type or Workfront Planning.  
    
    Unlike Workfront, where the object types are predefined, in Workfront Planning, you can create your own object types.  
    
    For example, in Workfront the object types of Program, Portfolio, Project, Task, or Issue are already created.  
    
    In Workfront Planning, you can create any record types that meet your organization's workflows. Later, you can define how the record types relate to one another or form dependencies. 
    
    For more information, see [Record types overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/overview-of-record-types.md).

* **Record**: An instance of a record type. 

    ![](assets/records-highlighted-in-campaign-record-type-list.png)
       
    After adding a record type to a workspace, you can start adding records of that type on the record type's page. 

    For example, "Campaign" can be a record type and "Summer Campaign for EMEA" is a record of the Campaign record type
        
    For more information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).

* **Workspace template**: You can create a workspace using predefined templates. You can use the predefined record types and fields that come in a template, or you can add your own. 

    ![](assets/workspaces-page-with-templates-thumbnails.png)

    Adobe Workfront Planning comes with a Sales, Marketing, and Product Management workspace template. 
    
    For more information, see [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md).

* **Fields**: Fields are attributes that you can add to record types. Fields contain information about the record type. <!--check the shot below, "Connection" needs to be in lowercase-->

    ![](assets/drop-down-list-of-record-fields.png)

    Considerations about record fields:
    
    * The fields you add for a record type automatically become associated with all records of that type and can be used to capture data about those records. 

    * Fields display as columns in the Table view applied to a record  type page. They also display in the record's page. 

    * Fields are unique to a record type and do not transfer from one record type to another. 

   * Fields are fully customizable and are accessible only in Workfront Planning. You cannot access Workfront Planning fields from Workfront. 

    For more information, see [Create fields](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/create-fields.md).
    
    A new record type is associated with the following predefined fields, by default: 

    * Name
    * Description
    * Start Date
    * End Date
    * Status

    You can create custom fields of the following types:  

    * Single-line text 
    * Paragraph   
    * Multi-select 
    * Single-select 
    * Date 
    * Number 
    * Percentage 
    * Currency
    * Checkbox 
    * Formula 
    * People
    * Created by
    * Created date
    * Last modified by
    * Last modified date
   
* **Connected record types**, **Connected records**, and **Connected fields**:  You can create a connection between the following entities in Workfront Planning:
    
    * Two Workfront Planning record types.
    * A record type and a Workfront project, program, portfolio, company, or group object type. 
    * A record type and an Adobe Experience Manager asset or folder. 

        You must have an Adobe Experience Manager license to link record types with Experience Manager objects.

        ![](assets/new-connection-tab-with-workfront-aem-options.png)


    After you establish a connection between the record types, you can connect individual records of those types to one another. The connection between the records displays as a linked record field.

* **Linked fields** (or lookup fields): After you establish the connection between two record types and you link individual records together, you can reference the linked records' fields on the record you are connecting from.

    For example, if you connect a Campaign record type with a Workfront Project object type, you can display the Budget field of connected projects on the campaign records. 

    ![](assets/add-lookup-fields-modal.png)

    >[!TIP]
    >
    > You cannot add the following field types as lookup fields from the connected record or object types:
    >
    >* People
    >* Created by
    >* Last modified by
    >* Workfront typeahead fields (including fields like Project Owner, or Project Sponsor)

    For information about linking record types, records, and creating linked fields, see the following articles:

    * [Connect record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/connect-record-types.md)
    * [Connect records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/connect-records.md)

<!--not yet:* Fields are reusable across Record Types.  -->

* **Views**: Records display under their respective record type page in different types of views.

    ![](assets/view-types-drop-down-from-record-type-list.png)

    Views contain personalized settings of a specific view type, such as the list of fields (columns), a list of records (rows), their order (sort), an applied or applicable filter and grouping.  
    
    The following are view types that you can apply to the record type page: 

    * **Table view**: Displays records and their fields, includind connected and lookup fields, in a table format. The rows of the table are the individual records, and the columns are the record fields. This is the default view. 

        ![](assets/table-view-example.png)

    * **Timeline view**: Displays records that have at least two Date-type fields in a chronological timeline. You can display up to 5 connected record types and their records in the timeline view. 

        ![](assets/grouping-applied-in-timeline-view.png)

    * **Calendar view**: Displays records that have at least two Date-type fields in a calendar format. 
    ![](assets/calendar-view-example.png)
