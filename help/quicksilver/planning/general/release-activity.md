## Week of <date>

### Added a limit of 100 views for a record type

Production: <date> 

Preview: To be determined 

A record type can have only 100 views. Prior to this change, there was no limit for how many views a record type could have.  

For more information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/maestro/views/manage-record-views.md). 

### Add sections to the record's page 

Production: <date> 

Preview: To be determined 

To better organize information on the record's page for more efficient readability and navigation we have introduced sections to the record's page. The section titles serve as headers that organize the content into distinct categories. The sections can be expanded or collapsed, if needed.  

For information, see [Manage the record page](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/manage-the-record-page.md). 

### Enable Workfront Planning notifications for customers that are not in the Adobe Unified Experience

Production: <date>  

Preview: TBD  

If your organization is not in the Adobe Unified Experience, you receive an email notification when someone tags you in a comment on the record page. You cannot manage the email notifications for Workfront Planning. The emails are generated by default and you will always receive an email when someone adds you to a comment.

For more information, see [Adobe Workfront Planning notifications: Article index](/help/quicksilver/maestro/notifications/notifications-information.md). 

###  New Planning section added to the left panel of a Workfront project, portfolio, and program

## Week of May 13, 2024

### Real-time updates in the timeline view after editing records

Production: May 14, 2024 

Preview: To be determined.  

When a user updates the information on a record, other users can view the updated information in the record's timeline view in real time. This ensures that all users view the updated information at the same time, in sync with when the changes happen. 

### Add record from the view header

Production: May 14, 2024

Preview: To be determined

We have added a "New record" button on the header of a record type page. You can now create records from any view. Prior to this enhancement, you could create records only from the table view.  

For more information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/create-records.md). 


### New warning about object visibility when connecting records 

Production: May 15, 2024

Preview: To be determined

When you create connections to object types outside of Workfront Planning, you are now notified that anyone working in the current workspace will have visibility to all the linked objects and their lookup fields, regardless of their permissions and access levels in the other application. 

For example, if you link projects from Workfront Planning campaigns, everyone with access to View the campaign will also have access to view the linked projects and the information from their lookup fields, even when they don't have any permissions to the linked projects, or access to projects, in general. You obtain access to Planning records when you receive permissions to workspaces. 

For more information, see [Connect record types](/help/quicksilver/maestro/architecture/connect-record-types.md).

### Add sections to the record's preview and details pages

Production: May 15, 2024

Preview: To be determined 

To better organize information on the record's page for more efficient readability and navigation, we have introduced sections to the record's page. The section titles serve as headers that organize the fields into distinct categories. The sections are fully customizable and can be expanded or collapsed, if needed.  

For information, see [Manage the record page](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/manage-the-record-page.md). 

### Real-time updates for field configuration changes 

Production: May 16, 2024

Preview: To be determined 

When a user changes any field configuration (name, description, list of options etc) in a record type, other users view those changes in real-time. This ensures that everyone views the correct fields and their information at the same time.  

>[!WARNING]
>
>When formula expressions change, or options are added or removed from a select-type field, there will be loss of data for the records that already have information stored in the fields whose configuration is modified. 
>
>There is no warning or indication that this data loss could happen when you change the configuration of fields. 
>
>There is no notification to other users that the field configuration has changed.  

For more information, see [Edit fields](/help/quicksilver/maestro/fields/edit-fields.md).

## Week of April 1, 2024

### Reorder the fields on record pages

Production: April 4, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

As a Workspace manager, you now can reorder the fields listed in the record page or preview. Updating the order of the fields changes the order of fields on all records of the same type, for everyone viewing the record page or the record preview.

## Week of March 25, 2024

### New flexible record type organization for workspaces

Production: March 25, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

To create efficiency for you when setting up workspaces, we have modified the way you organize record types in a workspace. Some of the improvements include:  

* Create up to 50 sections of record types in each workspace. Existing Operational Record Types and Taxonomies sections remain in the existing workspaces.  

* Fully customize all new workspaces and their new sections to reflect your processes and organization's needs.  

* Dynamically move record types within a workspace by dragging and dropping them where they need to be, including across different sections.  

For more information, see [Create record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-record-types.md). 

### Duplicate views 

Production: March 25, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

To save you time and keep consistency, you can now duplicate an existing view that you have permissions to access.   

Duplicating a view creates an identical view, using the same filters, sorting criteria, and groupings. Duplicating a view does not maintain the permissions of the original view.   

For more information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/maestro/views/manage-record-views.md). 

### Renamed the Maestro area in the Main Menu to Planning

Production: March, 27, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

We have renamed the Maestro area in the Main Menu to Planning.  

For an overview of Adobe Workfront Planning, see [Adobe Workfront Planning overview](/help/quicksilver/maestro/general/planning-overview.md). 

### New experience when deleting a record type

Production: March 27, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

We have redesigned the confirmation box when deleting a record type. Deleting a record type is impactful, as it also deletes all the records, their fields, the information in the fields, as well as the views associated with the record type. Deleted record types and their deleted information cannot be recovered.  

For this reason, we wanted to ensure the user's intent is accurate when deleting a record type, so we have introduced an extra step in confirming the deletion. For more information, see [Delete record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/delete-record-types.md).  

## Week of March 18, 2024

### Filters available in the calendar view

Production: March 19, 2024

### The record type Excel import is temporarily disabled  

Production: March 21, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

We are temporarily disabling importing record types using an Excel or CSV file. This functionality will be available at a later date. 

## Week of March 11, 2024

### At-a-glance record details display in the table view

Production: March 14, 2024

Preview: To be determined 

To make it easier to view additional information about records when using the table view, we have introduced a new Details preview that displays a quick view of the record's details. The following is some of the information included in the record preview: 

* Relevant record details at a glance 

* Ability to modify record information 

* A link to open the record's page 

For more information, see [Edit records](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/edit-records.md). 

### New tabbed design for record views 

Production: March 14, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

For better navigation and ease of use, we have redesigned the display of record views. Now, the views display horizontally, as tabs on the record type page, so you can easily navigate through them. Prior to this enhancement, views displayed in the View drop-down menu.  

Views display chronologically by added date from left to right. Shared  views also display in chronological order of when they were shared.  

For more information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/maestro/views/manage-record-views.md).  

### Dynamic design of a record view

Production: March 14, 2024
Preview: To be determined 

We have updated the look and feel of the views in the record type page. The new views are dynamically responsive and quickly adjust to the size of your screen. The toolbar option labels are hidden on smaller screens to make the toolbar easier to use.

* [Manage the table view](/help/quicksilver/maestro/views/manage-the-table-view.md) 
* [Manage the timeline view](/help/quicksilver/maestro/views/manage-the-timeline-view.md).

### Allow System Administrators to manage all shared views 

Production: March 14, 2024

Preview: To be determined 

To be consistent with all other areas of the system and to be able to maintain and control any view available to you as a System Administrator, you now have Manage permissions to any view shared with you in Maestro. Prior to this enhancement, view creators could have given you permissions to View or Manage the view. Now, if the view is shared with you and you are a System Administrator, you will have Manage permissions to the view, by default.  

For more information, see [Share views](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-views.md). 

### Unauthorized page when sharing a view without permissions

## Week of February 5, 2024

### Modify permissions based on license types

Production: February 6, 2024 

Preview: To be determined 

We have modified permissions levels to take into account users' license types. Prior to this enhancement, there were no differences in workspace permissions based on the license types of the users.  

The following are the highest levels of permissions that users can receive based on the user's license type:  

* Users with a Plan license (or Standard license, in the new license model) can create and manage workspaces, record types, and records. 

* Users with a Work license (or Light, in the new license model) can view and contribute to a workspace shared with them, as well as the record types and records of that workspace.  The Work- (or Light-) license users can also create, edit, and delete records in workspaces where they have Contribute access. 

* Users with a Review or Requestor license (or Contributor, in the new license model) can only view the workspaces shared with them, as well as the record types and records of those workspaces. They cannot create, edit, or delete record types or records.  

For information about the new license model, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md). 

For information about the connection between license type and permissions in the planning capabilities, see [License type overview when using Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/license-type-overview.md).

We have redesigned and improved the experience of adding options or objects for the following field types:

* Single-select
* Multi-select
* People
* Connected record fields (when connecting planning capability record types or Workfront objects)

With the new improvement, a smaller, more responsive box displays first.  
 
For connected fields, you can add them doing one of the following:

* Add objects to the connected field by searching and selecting them from a list in the table view, while inline editing the field
* Click to open the larger Connect objects box, where you can view all item names in addition to more information about the items. 

The improvements are now available when updating fields in the table view of a record type.

### Add thumbnails to records 

Production: February 1, 2024

Preview: To be determined  

You can now add individual thumbnails to each record to distinguish them in a view. In the table view, you can add image files that you have previously saved on your computer as thumbnails. The thumbnails can be unique to each record and display in both the table and the timeline views of the record type page. 

For more information, see [Add a thumbnail to a record](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/add-thumbnails-to-records.md).  

### Remove connected record type cards

Production: February 1, 2024

Preview: To be determined

To avoid confusion and simplify the management of workspaces, we have removed the auto-generated, read-only record type cards for connected external objects from a workspace.
<!-- Now, when you connect Workfront objects with Maestro records, for example, you can navigate to Workfront to manage the linked objects. You can no longer find the read-only Workfront object record type page in Maestro. This simplifies the number of objects and places you manage information for your objects.  -->

For more information, see [Connect records](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/connect-records.md).   

## Week of January 22, 2024

### New History section displays system activity for planning capabilities records

### Planning capabilities permissions for workspaces and views

Production: January 11, 2024

Preview: To be determined

You can now share a workspace or a view with users and groups. You can set their permissions to different levels, depending on what information they need to view or edit. 

When you share a workspace, users have permissions to the record types, records, and fields in that space.

When you share a workspace, users don't receive sharing permissions to the views associated with the record types of the workspace. You must grant separate permissions to views. 

The following are the permissions levels for workspaces:  

* View: Users can view workspaces that are shared with them. They can also view record types, and records from the shared workspace. 

* Contribute: Users can create, edit, or delete records in the workspace that is shared with them.  They cannot create or edit record types or workspaces that are shared with them.

### Update the primary field in a table view of a record type

Preview and Production: December 14, 2023 

You can now choose the field you want to display in the first column of a table view. This field is now called a primary field.  

Prior to this enhancement, the Name field of a record always displayed in the first column of the table view and it could not be placed in another position.

With this improvement, notice the following: 

* The Name column or field is still the first column of a table, by default.  

* You can choose any field of the following types to be a primary field and replace the Name field in the first column: 

    * Single-line text

>Your organization's instance of Workfront must be onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform or the Adobe Admin Console to be able to connect Adobe Workfront Planning capabilities records to Adobe Experience Manager Assets.
>
>If you have questions about onboarding to the Adobe Admin Console, see the [Adobe Unified Experience FAQ](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/unified-experience-faq.md).

You can now establish a connection between Adobe Workfront Planning capabilities record types and Adobe Experience Manager Assets.  

After you establish the connection, the following functionality is available with this update:  

* You can link Experience Manager assets and folders to a planning capability record from a specific repository in Experience Manager Assets to which they have access. You can connect asset fields to planning capability fields in this process. 

* Planning capability users can view the name of the connected assets, as well as the values of the connected fields in the planning capabilities.

<!--removed per PM, for now: 
* An Experience Manager Assets record type is automatically created in Maestro after you establish the connection. Connected assets are visible in the Maestro table and timeline views of this new record type.  
-->

* You can click the asset name in the table view of the planning capability record from the connected record field, and view a pop-up window with the asset thumbnail and several key fields. From the pop-up window, you can navigate to the asset viewer in Experience Manager and view all the details about it.
