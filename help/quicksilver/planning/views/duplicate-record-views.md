{{planning-important-intro}}

If you want to keep multiple versions of a view and make slight changes between the versions, you can duplicate a view in Adobe Workfront Planning. 

Duplicating a view creates identical copies of an existing view. 

The sharing permissions of the original view do not transfer to the duplicated view.  

Duplicating views is identical for all types of views in Workfront Planning.

## Duplicate a record view

{{step1-to-planning}} 

1. Click the card of a workspace. 

    The workspace opens and the record types display as cards. 
 
1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 
    By default, all the records of the type selected display in the table view. 

1. Depending on which environment you use, do the following: 

   * In the Production environment, hover over one the of the view's names in the view tab, then click **More** ![More menu](assets/more-menu.png) to the left of the view name, then click **Duplicate**. 
   * <span class="preview">In the Preview environment, click the dropdown icon ![Dropdown icon](assets/drop-down-icon.png) next to the current view name, hover over the name of a view, click **More**, then **Duplicate**.</span> 

      ![More menu on view with options](assets/more-menu-for-views-expanded-with-delete-option.png)
       
      The view is duplicated and the new view's name follows the following pattern: `Original view's name (Copy)`. The new view tab displays at the end of all view tabs.
