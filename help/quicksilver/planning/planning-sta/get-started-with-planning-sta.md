# Get started with Adobe Planning Standalone

This article describes how you can benefit from using the standalone version of Adobe Workfront Planning.

## How your company can acquire an Adobe Workfront Standalone Planning license

Whether you are an Adobe Workfront customer or not, you can speak with your Adobe account representation about a Workfront Planning Standalone license. <!--do people HAVE to be WF or Adobe customers at all, or can anyone buy this?-->

## Integrated vs Standalone Workfront Planning versions

With the integrated version of Workfront Planning, you can:

* Connect Planning objects to Workfront objects
* Add existing custom fields from Workfront to Planning record types
* Automatically create Workfront projects based on Planning information
* See Planning information in Workfront's Canvas Dashboard reporting system

With the stanalone version of Workfront Planning, you can: 

* Use the Workfront Planning Standalone open API to integrate Planning objects with any other applications <!--ask Lilit and I think this is an Integrated benefit also-->
* 

## Workfront Planning Standalone terminology
