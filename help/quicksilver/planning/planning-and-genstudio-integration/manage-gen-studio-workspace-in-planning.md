## Considerations for managing a GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning

* Your organization must purchase Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing before you can view a GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning.

* Depending on how many Workfront instances your organization has, you automatically have the following permissions to the GenStudio workspace in Planning:  

   <!--this table is also in the Get started article-->

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
   <col> 
   </col> 
   <col> 
   </col> 
   <tbody> 
      <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><p>One instance of Workfront</p></td> 
      <td> 
   <p>The GenStudio workspace is visible in your instance of Workfront Planning</p>
   <p>Workfront administrators have Manage permissions to the GenStudio workspace in Planning</p>
   <p>All other users have Contribute access to the GenStudio workspace in Planning</p>
   </td> </tr>
      <tr> 
   <td> 
      <p> Multiple instances of Workfront</p> </td> 
      <td> 
      <p>The GenStudio workspace is visible from all Workfront instances</p>
   <p>All users with access to GenStudio for Performance Marketing and Workfront Planning have Contribute permissions on the GenStudio in Planning</p> </td> 
   </tr>
      </tbody> 
   </table> 

* Updating the workspace configuration, record types, views, and fields for a GenStudio workspace is identical with updating a Workfront Planning workspace with its elements.
