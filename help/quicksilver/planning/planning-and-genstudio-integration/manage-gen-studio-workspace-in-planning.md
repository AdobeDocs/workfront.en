## Manage the GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning

>[!NOTE]
>
>Before managing the GenStudio workspace, see the article [Get started with the Workfront Planning and GenStudio for Performance Marketing integration](/help/quicksilver/planning/planning-and-genstudio-integration/get-started-with-workfront-planning-and-genstudio-integration.md). 


1. Log in to Workfront as a system administrator. 
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Planning]**.

   The Workfront Planning landing page opens. 
    
1. Click **Other workspaces** and find a workspace that has an indication that was created by the System and has the GenStudio tag on its card. 

    ![GenStudio workspace card with tag](assets/genstudio-card-with-tag-highlighted.png)

1. Click the **GenStudio workspace card** to open the GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning. 
1. By default, the following GenStudio record types are created and visible from Workfront Planning:

    * Campaigns
    * Products
    * Activations
    * Channels
    * Regions

    There is an indication on the GenStudio record types that they were originally created in GenStudio. 

    ![GenStudio record type card with tag](assets/genstudio-record-type-with-tag-and-tooltip-highlighted.png)

1. Click any of the record type cards to view records for that type. 

1. Do one of the following:

    * Click **Share**, then click **Copy the view link** to share a link to the record type, or **Export the current view** to export it to a file. You can only export the table view.

    * Click **+ View** to create a view for the GenStudio record type.
   
    * Manage the view elements from any of the view. 

      For example, you can change the filter, groupings, sort, settings of a view, where available. 

      For information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-record-views.md). 

   * Add records in the table or the timeline view. 

      You can only create records from scratch or by importing a CSV or Excel file. 

      For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).

      Records are visible from both Workfront and GenStudio. 

   * Delete records in the table view. 

      Deleted records can be recovered from the table view recycle bin in Workfront Planning, if they are deleted from Workfront. For information, see [Restore deleted records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/restore-deleted-records.md)
