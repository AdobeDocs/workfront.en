## Considerations for managing a GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning

* Your organization must purchase Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing before you can view a GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning.

* Workfront users must have access to GenStudio to be able to see the GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning. 

* You can update the following information of a GenStudio workspace from Workfront Planning:

   * Edit the workspace settings <!--check to see if this is correct? is this editable or read only from Planning??-->
   * Edit the record types and their fields <!--check on this-->
   * Share, edit, and add views
   * Add new record types
   * Edit, add, or delete records 

* Updating the workspace configuration, record types, views, and fields for a GenStudio workspace is identical with updating a Workfront Planning workspace with its elements.

## Manage GenStudio record types from Workfront Planning

>[!NOTE]
>
>Before managing the GenStudio workspace, see the article [Get started with the Workfront Planning and GenStudio for Performance Marketing integration](/help/quicksilver/planning/planning-and-genstudio-integration/get-started-with-workfront-planning-and-genstudio-integration.md). 

1. Log in to Workfront as a user who also has access to GenStudio. 
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Planning]**.

   The Workfront Planning main page opens. 
    
1. Click **Other workspaces** and find a workspace that has an indication that was created by the **System** and has the **GenStudio** tag on its card. 

    ![GenStudio workspace card with tag](assets/genstudio-card-with-tag-highlighted.png)

1. Click the **GenStudio workspace card** to open the GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning. 
1. By default, the following GenStudio record types are created and visible from Workfront Planning:

    * Campaigns
    * Products
    * Activations
    * Channels
    * Regions

    There is an indication on the GenStudio record type card that they were originally created in GenStudio. 

    <!--check screen shot-->

    ![GenStudio record type card with tag](assets/genstudio-record-type-with-tag-and-tooltip-highlighted.png)

1. Click any of the record type cards to view records for that type. 

1. Do one of the following:

   * Click **Share** in the upper-right corner of the record type page, then click one of the following:
      * **Copy the view link** to share a link to the record type
      * **Export the current view** to export it to a CSV or an Excel  file. 
      You can only export the table view. <!--check on this later; is this true or are there more options in the Share button-->

   * Click **+ View** to create a view for the GenStudio record type.  

      For information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-record-views.md). 

   * Click the **Full screen** icon ![Open full view in full screen icon](assets/open-full-screen-icon.png) to open any view in full-screen mode. 
   
   * Manage a view's elements from any views. 

      For example, you can change the filter, groupings, sort, settings of a view, where available. 

      For information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-record-views.md). 

   * Add records in the table or the timeline view. 

      You can only create records from scratch or by importing a CSV or Excel file. 

      For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).

      Records are visible from both Workfront and GenStudio.

   * Edit records inline from the table view, or click a record to open its details page. 

      For information, see [Edit records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/edit-records.md).  

   * Delete records in the table view. 

      For information, see [Delete records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/delete-records.md). 

      Deleted records can be recovered from the table view recycle bin in Workfront Planning, if they are deleted from Workfront. 
      
      For information, see [Restore deleted records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/restore-deleted-records.md)
   
   * Hover over a field in the table view to sort or hide the field. 

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >You can edit a field's configuration and add more fields only when you have Manage permissions in GenStudio. <!--check to see if this is true??-->
