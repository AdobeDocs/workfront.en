## Prerequisites

The following must be in place before you can submit a request to a Workfront Planning request form: 

* The following must exist in Workfront Planning:

   * A workspace
   * A record type associated with a request form. For information, see [Create a request form in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/create-request-form.md).
   
* The request form must be shared with a link in a way you can access it. The following scenarios exist: 

   * If you have a Workfront account, the link has been shared only with internal people and you have access to the workspace. People outside Workfront cannot access a link shared internally. 
   * If you don't have a Workfront account, the link has been shared with external people. Workfront users can also use a link shared with external people. 

* The link to the form must not be expired.

## Considerations about submitting requests to Workfront Planning

* You cannot access the request forms for Workfront Planning requests without a specific link to the forms. 
* You cannot edit a request after you submit it to Workfront Planning.
* Each submitted request creates a record for the record type associated with the form you use. 
* Records created by submitting request forms cannot be differentiated from records added through any other method. For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md). 

## Submit a request to Workfront Planning

1. Go to the link shared with you from a Workfront Planning record type. 

1. Update the fields available in the form. Fields with an asterisk are required. 

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >   If the Workfront **Subject** field is available, it might not be visible in Workfront Planning. We recommend that you update as many fields in your request as possible to make the new record identifiable when it is added to the record type.

1. Click **Submit**.

   Your form is submitted and a new record is added to the record type associated with the form.
