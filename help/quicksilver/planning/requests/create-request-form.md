## Create a request form for a record type

{{step1-to-planning}}
  
1. Click the workspace where you want to add records.

    The workspace opens and the record types display as cards.

1. Click a record type card. For information about creating a record type, see [Create record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-record-types.md). 

    The record type page opens in the view that you last accessed. By default, a record type page opens in the table view. 

1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record type name in the page header, then click **Create request form**.
1. Update the name of the request form. By default, the name of the form is **Untitled request form**. <!--check this; you logged a bug to rename it to this but was it fixed?--> 
1. (Optional) Add a **Description** for the request form. 

   <!--Not possible yet: The Description is visible when you access the request form from the Requests area of Workfront.-->

1. Click **Create**. The request form for the selected record type opens. 

   ![](assets/campaigns-request-form-edit-mode.png)

   The request form contains the following information, by default:

   * Record fields available in the table view of the selected record type. <!--they are working on removing the limitation below-->

      >[!IMPORTANT]
      >
      >   Fields of the following types do not display in the request form: 
      >
      >    * People (includes Created by and Last modified by)
      >    * Connected fields (includes connections with Workfront, and Experience Manager assets)
      >    * Connected lookup fields
      >    * Formula
      >    * Created date
      >    * Last modified date

      <!--replace the above with this: 

            >[!IMPORTANT]
            >
            > Depending on what environment you use to create a request form, the following scenarios exist:
            >
            >* Fields of the following types do not display in the request form in the Preview or Production environments: 
            >
            >    * People (includes Created by and Last modified by)
            >    * Formula
            >    * Created date
            >    * Last modified date
            >    * Workfront object connected fields
            >    * Workfront objects connected lookup fields
            >* <span class="preview">Fields of the following types do not display in the request form in the Production environment. They display in the Preview environment:</span>
            >    * <span class="preview">Planning records' connected fields (includes connections with Workfront, and Experience Manager assets)</span>
            >    * <span class="preview">Planning records' connected lookup fields</span>
      -->

   * **Default section**: This is the default section break that Workfront applies to the request form. The Default section cannot be renamed or removed. 
   * **Subject** field: The field which will identify the request in Workfront. This capability is not yet available. The configuration and the value of the Subject field are not editable. 
   * All the fields associated with the record type. 

      The fields contained in the request form will be visible to everyone submitting a request to this record type. 

1. (Optional) Hover over any fields on the form that you want to remove, then click the **x** icon to remove them. They are added to the **Fields** tab to the left of the form. 

   For example, remove the **Subject** field, as this is not visible in Workfront Planning. <!--remove this step when we connect intake with the Requests area in Workfront-->
1. Click any field, then use the controls in the right panel in the form to define their size, or any of the following information:

   * **Label**: this is the name of the field as it will appear on the request form. This does not change the name of the record field.
   * **Instructions**: Add more information about the field.
   * **Make a required field**: When selected, the field must have a value. Otherwise, the form cannot be submitted. 
   * **Add logic**: Define what conditions must be met in order for the field to display or be hidden.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >   The field type of each field displays at the top of the right panel, after you select the field on the form. 
   >   
   >
   >   Currency, Number, and Percentage fields display as a Single-line text field type. However, the field format is preserved and the values inside these fields will display as Currency, Number, and Percentage values.

1. (Optional) Click the **Content elements** tab on the left side of the form, and add any of the following elements:

   * **Descriptive text**
   * **Section Break** 

   For more information about building a custom form, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md). 

1. (Optional) Click **Preview** to view how the form will display for other users when they will use it to submit a new record.
1. (Optional) Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the form's name in the header, then click **Edit** to update the name of the form.
1. Click **Publish** to publish the form and obtain a unique link for it. 

   The following things occur:

   * The **Publish** button is removed.
   * The **Unpublish** button is added to the form. Clicking it will prevent the form from being accessible. 
   * A **Share** button is added to the form.

1. Click **Share** to share the form with others. 

      ![](assets/share-box-for-request-form.png)

1. Select from the following options to indicate which types of users can access this form: 

      * Anyone with view or higher access to the workspace
      * Anyone with contribute or higher access to the workspace
      * Anyone with the link

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >When you select **Anyone with the link**, anyone can access the form and submit a new record, even people outside your organization that don't have a Workfront account. 

1. (Conditional) If you selected **Anyone with the link** in the previous step, select the **Link expiration date** from the available calendar. People will receive an error after the link expires and you must update the link date before they can access the form again. 

   You can select future dates within 180 days from the current date.     

1. Click **Save and copy link** to save the sharing details for the form.

   The form sharing options are saved and the link is copied to your clipboard. You can now share it with others.

1. Click **Save** in the lower-right corner of the screen to save the form.    
1. Click the left-pointing arrow to the left of the form's name in the header to close the form. 

   The record type page opens. 
1. (Optional) Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record type name in the header, then do one of the following: 
   * Click **Update request form** to make any changes to the request form.
   * Click **Copy link to the request form**  to share the link to the form with others.
