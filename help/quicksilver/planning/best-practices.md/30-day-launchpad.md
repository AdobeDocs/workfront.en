# The 30-day launchpad: roll out your strategic home 

{{planning-important-intro}}

Use this guide to learn how to roll out Adobe Workfront Planning to design a strategy that prioritizes psychological safety, minimizes disruption, and delivers quick wins. 

## Overview of how to start fast and scale smart 

The most common obstacle to a successful rollout isn't technology. It's "technology-blame". When teams encounter the challenge of working with new people, new processes, and new tools at once, the tool becomes a target for frustration. 
 
The 30-day launchpad is built on the "team-first" adoption model. Instead of attempting an enterprise-wide rollout that usually requires months of coordination, we focus on a decentralized, team-led approach that delivers immediate ROI within a specific functional unit. 

## The phased transition of guided autonomy 

The successful rollout of a product uses guided autonomy. This means the administrator defines how teams should work in a structured system of governed defaults and templates. They define the "lanes on the road" (governed defaults and templates), while allowing teams the flexibility to choose their own adventure within them.   

Most importantly, guided autonomy is evolutionary. Instead of enforcing a complete enterprise taxonomy on the first day, the administrator starts with minimal global definitions based on the needs of the first pilot team. 

As more teams are onboarded, the administrator observes common patterns and iterates on the global standards. 

As an administrator, you are not surrendering control, but instead you are scaling it intelligently based on what actually works. 

To activate this evolutionary shift, do the following:

1. Choose a pilot team that is ready and willing to innovate.
2. Use the first 15 days of your launch to prove the model through one of two high-momentum paths:  

    * **The parallel path (or a dual-tracking approach):** The team maintains their current workflow while simultaneously modeling their next planning cycle in Workfront Planning. 
    
        This builds muscle memory and confidence without the risk of a single point of failure. 

    * **The clean break:** After an initial design exercise using sample data to validate the model, the team moves their live starting point directly into Workfront Planning for their next cycle.  

    In both paths, the goal is to move beyond theory and into real-world application as quickly as possible, ensuring the tool is used for actual strategic work rather than remaining just a sandbox exercise.

## The 30-day timeline: Your "lightning moment" 

A successful rollout is powered by momentum. This 30-day schedule moves you from configuration to your first automated win. 

 

### Days 1-10: The team foundation 

Build a strategic foundation by establishing a **lightweight Hub-and-Spoke architecture** from Day 1. While a complex enterprise-wide taxonomy is not required yet, you should immediately create two environments: a **Global Classification Workspace** (the Hub) and your first **Team Workspace** (the Spoke). 

 

This **Team-First** architecture allows you to: 

 

* **Design the Hub to support the Spoke:** Focus the global classification workspace specifically on the objects that matter most to your pilot team (e.g., their specific Brands or Products). This firms up the **collaborative handshake between enterprise governance and team autonomy** while keeping the design effort manageable. 

* **Act as an Enabler, not a Guardian:** Shift your role from rule-setting to capability-building. Partner with the team to structure their planning environment. 

* **Collaborate on design:** Work directly with your pilot team to define the record types and fields that reflect their real-world needs, not an abstract corporate ideal. 

* **Connect strategy to work:** Enable the link between your planning records and the workflow module. 

* **Mirror current data:** Use the team's existing tools (Excel/Core) to populate Workfront Planning, ensuring the data feels familiar and relevant. 

* **Built for flexibility:** Remember that Workfront Planning is designed to evolve. You can start with team-level processes and easily elevate or migrate them to enterprise-level governance when the business is ready. 

 

### Day 15: The first "lightning moment" 

Aim for your first major win by Day 15: **automated project creation**. 

* Configure a native automation that detects a "Ready to Execute" status. 

* Trigger the creation of a linked project in the workflow module. 

* **The value:** Your team sees their strategic intent automatically trigger execution work. This "lightning moment" proves the value of the bridge and builds buy-in. 

 

### Days 16-30: Gradual transition toward Enterprise Scale 

With the "lightning moment" achieved, move the team's start point into Workfront Planning. As this **Team-First** model succeeds, you begin the path toward **Enterprise Scale** by identifying patterns that work. 

 

* **Introduce the intake form:** Use the form as the new gateway for strategic requests to ensure data integrity. 

* **Observe and standardize:** Use the Primary Workspace to observe how the pilot team uses the tool. These real-world examples will shape your eventual enterprise design. 

* **Decommission legacy spreadsheets:** Move fully into Workfront Planning as the process matures. 

* **Shift power users:** Use the **table view** for direct, high-velocity plan management. 

 

## Success metrics for the launchpad 

Look for these early indicators of health: 

* **Adoption:** The first 5-10 strategic records successfully link to execution projects. 

* **Advocacy:** The pilot team begins evangelizing the tool to adjacent teams. 

* **Efficiency:** Automation reduces the time from strategic approval to project start. 

* **Trust:** Stakeholders use Workfront Planning timelines rather than manual status decks for reviews. 

 

## Best practices and tips 

 

### Do: 

* **Start with an excited pilot team.** Acknowledge that a global rollout is a significant lift. Focus on a POC with a team that is eager to innovate and can provide a blueprint for others. 

* **Define lanes, not walls.** Use Guided Autonomy to provide structure without killing exploration. 

* **Prioritize psychological safety.** Let teams know that legacy tools stay until they are comfortable with the new flow. 

* **Celebrate the quick wins.** Highlight the first automated project creation to the entire team. 

* **Establish a champion.** Identify a power user in each team to lead the transition. 

 

### Don't: 

* **Don't mandate "big bang" changes.** Forcing everyone to switch on Day 1 causes technology-blame. 

* **Don't ignore the "why."** Ensure every team member understands how the strategic thread makes their work more visible. 

* **Don't wait for perfection.** Your taxonomy will evolve. Start with your best guess and refine as you go.

## The 30-Day Launchpad: Rolling Out Your Strategic Home 

 

## Goal 

Learn how to roll out Workfront Planning (WFP) using a strategy that prioritizes psychological safety, minimizes disruption, and delivers quick wins. 

 

## Overview: Start Fast, Scale Smart 

The most common obstacle to a successful rollout isn't technology—it's "technology-blame." When teams face new people, new processes, and new tools at once, the tool becomes a target for frustration. 

 

The 30-day launchpad is built on the **"Team-First" adoption model**. Instead of attempting an **Enterprise-Wide** rollout that usually requires months of coordination, we focus on a decentralized, team-led approach that delivers immediate ROI within a specific functional unit. 

 

## The phased transition: Guided Autonomy 

Successful rollouts use **Guided Autonomy**. This means the Admin defines the "lanes on the road" (governed defaults and templates) while allowing teams the flexibility to choose their own adventure within them.  

 

Crucially, Guided Autonomy is **evolutionary**. Instead of enforcing a complete enterprise taxonomy on Day 1, the Admin starts with minimal global definitions based on the needs of the first pilot team. As more teams are onboarded, the Admin observes common patterns and iterates on the global standards. You aren't surrendering control; you are scaling it intelligently based on what actually works. 

 

To activate this evolutionary shift, choose a pilot team that is ready and willing to innovate. Use the first 15 days to prove the model through one of two high-momentum paths: 

 

*   **The Parallel Path (Dual-Tracking):** The team maintains their current workflow while simultaneously modeling their next planning cycle in WFP. This builds "muscle memory" and confidence without the risk of a single point of failure. 

*   **The Clean Break:** After an initial design exercise using sample data to validate the model, the team moves their "live" planning start point directly into WFP for their next cycle. 

 

In both paths, the goal is to move beyond theory and into real-world application as quickly as possible, ensuring the tool is used for actual strategic work rather than remaining a "sandbox" exercise.
