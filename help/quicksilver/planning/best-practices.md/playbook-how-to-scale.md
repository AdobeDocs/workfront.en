# Turn your first win into sustainable momentum: a playbook for managed scaling

{{planning-important-intro}}


Landing your first successful Adobe Workfront Planning use case is a breakthrough moment: demand surges, new teams want access, and leadership sees the potential for enterprise-wide visibility. 

But this is also the most fragile phase of adoption: move too quickly toward rigid governance and you risk driving teams back to spreadsheets; move too loosely and you recreate the very sprawl you set out to solve. 

This playbook outlines a balanced approach on how to use Workfront Planning as a reconciliation engine that prioritizes visibility first, enables local innovation, and allows enterprise standards to emerge from real operational success rather than being imposed prematurely.

The following are learnings from our experience and some tips about what to watch for. 
 
## 1. The success trap 

Sometimes it can feel like the most dangerous phase of Workfront Planning adoption is immediately after the first successful use case or Proof of Concept. Enthusiasm is high, but the fear of technical debt and administrative sprawl can lead to two equally damaging responses: 

* **Over governance**: Locking down the system so tightly that new teams revert to spreadsheets. 

* **Zero governance**: Letting every team create their own fields and record types, recreating the fragmented metadata sprawl found in legacy environments. 

## 2. The core philosophy: Workfront Planning as the reconciliation engine 

Instead of trying to stop teams from being different, we position Workfront Planning as the place where those differences are made visible so they can be reconciled. 

To support this effort, consider the following: 

* **Manage adoption velocity**: It is natural to feel cautious about expanding into a new tool before optimizing existing environments. While choosing to simplify first provides a highly governed foundation, it can delay time-to-value for teams ready to align. We believe the most effective way to lead through this change is to recognize that visibility is Step 1; momentum toward a shared, enterprise-ready tool (moving away from the sprawl of presentations and spreadsheets) is what ultimately unblocks long-term goals.  

    We recommend that instead of a mandate to clean up first, you allocate a smaller portion of resources to ongoing maintenance and a significantly larger portion to solving pressing business needs. 
    
    For example, spending a year solely on "cleaning up" taxonomies yields little incremental value. However, delivering cross-team visibility provides the transformative value your stakeholders need, while providing the unified data structure you need to govern the environment over time. 
    
    You can achieve cross-team visibility through a unified enterprise calendar or a consolidated go-to market roadmap. 

* **Acknowledge the reality**: Independent teams naturally develop their own processes, which often stay hidden in siloed spreadsheets. By making these processes visible in a shared environment, you put them in the one place where they can finally be addressed and improved.

    >
    >Transitioning to Workfront Planning doesn't create a mess; it shines a light on the one that already exists. 


* **Acknowledge the sign of progress**: When a team asks for their own fields, it's not "sprawl". Consider it a sign of adoption. It means that the team sees Workfront Planning as their workspace. 

* **Manage debt, don't hide it**: It is natural to be concerned about the effort required to clean up divergent taxonomies later. However, the alternative — forcing strict standards too early — often drives teams back to spreadsheets where their processes (and their debt) remain hidden. By allowing teams to begin in Workfront Planning with their current classifications, you are moving that debt into a visible, governed environment. This makes the eventual reconciliation an iterative task rather than a single, overwhelming migration project.  

## 3. The guided autonomy governance model 

You define the lanes on the road  and the local playgrounds (or the governed defaults and templates), while you allow teams the flexibility to choose their own path within them. 

Consider the following components of the guided autonomy governance model: 

* [The global lanes](#the-global-lanes)
* [The local playgrounds](#the-local-playgrounds-or-the-spokes)

For information, also see:

* [Roll out your strategic home: a 30-day launchpad](/help/quicksilver/planning/best-practices.md/30-day-launchpad.md)
* [Architect your success: modeling your campaign hierarchy](/help/quicksilver/planning/best-practices.md/model-campaign-hierarchy.md)

### The global lanes 

The following are characteristics of the global lanes: 

* **Controlled objects**: Objects that every team must use for enterprise reporting (for example, `Strategic Pillar`, `Region`, `Fiscal Quarter`). 

* **Managed by**: The Center of excellence or the Marketing Operations Administrator. 

* **Rule**: These fields are shared and mandatory. 

### The local playgrounds (or the "spokes") 

The following are characteristics of the local playgrounds

* **Experimental Objects**: Fields or record types specific to a team's tactical needs (for example, a social team's `Influencer Handle` or a web team's `URL Slug`). 

* **Managed by**: The Team Lead (with light guidance). 

* **Rule**: Teams can innovate here. If a local field is adopted by more than three teams, it can be  promoted to a global lane.  

## 4. Consider the governance paradox: teams first and standards will follow 

A common challenge in scaling Workfront Planning is deciding which comes first: enterprise governance or the team's operational alignment.

We believe the most effective way to navigate this is to recognize that enterprise value is built on a two-way street: 

* **Teams need relevance**: The enterprise only realizes value when its teams are actively executing. Therefore, governance must serve the teams by providing structure that supports their known operational needs. 

* **The enterprise needs visibility**: Leadership can only make informed decisions when data is clean enough to aggregate. Therefore, the teams must serve the enterprise by providing the minimum viable metadata required for portfolio visibility.  

The goal of managed scaling is to find the intersection of these two needs by standardizing enough to provide visibility, but not so much that you stall team execution.  

Consider the following stages of building your governance model: 

* [Align priorities: data vs. visualization](#align-priorities-data-vs-visualization)
* [The service-led observation phase](#the-service-led-observation-phase)
* [Retroactive harmonization](#retroactive-harmonization)

### Align priorities: data vs. visualization

When scaling, recognize that the definition of value represents differs between personas: 

* **The administrator or product owner** values unified taxonomies and classifications. Their goal is a clean data architecture that supports long-term scalability. 

* **The stakeholder or leader** values visualization and insight which can be captured in a global calendar or a portfolio timeline. Their goal is identifying the lightning moment that makes the data actionable. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The strategy is to use the stakeholder's need for visualization as the incentive for the team's compliance with the administrator's need for data standards. You get the unified taxonomy by delivering the calendar that leadership demands. 


### The service-led observation phase 

During early scale-up, the administrator's role is to facilitate this exchange between teams and the enterprise. 

As an administrator, you can facilitate this exchange by doing the following:

* **Prioritize operation over standardization**: It is better to have teams actively planning in siloed workspaces than to have them stalled by a lack of global definitions. This activity is the raw data required to build healthy, real-world standards. 

* **Identify the visibility minimums**: Work with leadership to identify the 3-5 fields that must be clean for enterprise reporting (for example, `Strategic Alignment`, `Start Date`, `Budget`). Focus your enforcement energy only on the visibility minimum fields. 

### Governance as a service

Once a pattern of known needs emerges across teams, the enterprise can move to consolidate those patterns into a global service. This is governance as a service. 

Do the following to achieve or governance as a service:

* **Observe successful patterns**: Identify the winning taxonomies that teams have already built and adopted. 

* **Reach the collaborative handshake**: Bring team champions together to refine their local successes into a shared enterprise standard. 

* **Deploy as a service**: Roll out the new global lanes not as a restriction, but as a way to simplify reporting and cross-team alignment for the people doing the work. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Remember that governance should be a response to operational success, not a prerequisite for it.  

## 5. Scaling mechanics for managing fields

### The pattern-based field growth model 

Applying this philosophy requires a thoughtful approach to data structure. To avoid governance sprawl, resist the urge to build global fields for every individual request. 

Instead, use the following field maturity path to let real-world usage guide your enterprise standards:  

* **Level 1: Local experiment**: Team A creates a custom field in their workspace. 

* **Level 2: Pattern recognition**: The administrator notices Teams B and C are using or asking for a similar field. 

* **Level 3: Enterprise standardization**: The administrator creates a single, standardized version of that field as a record type in the Global Taxonomy Workspace and syndicates it to the teams.  

### How to retire fields

You will reach a point when fields are no longer relevant and you must retire them. 

Because Workfront Planning does not currently have a native archive feature for fields, retiring a local field requires a deliberate soft retirement process to preserve historical data without cluttering the UI. 

To retire fields:

1. Do a data migration. Use a table view (or Fusion) to bulk-copy values from the local shadow field into the new global lane field. Ensure the data is validated and cleaned during this move. 

2. Rename e field for deprecation: Rename the local field with a prefix like `[DEPRECATED]` or `z_` (for example, `z_Language (Old)`). This pushes the field to the bottom of field pickers and signals to users that it should no longer be the source of truth. 

3. Remove the deprecated field from all record forms. This is the most critical step. This prevents new data from being entered while keeping the old data visible in existing table views or reports if needed. 

4. Start the sunset period by keeping the deprecated field (prefixed and removed from the forms) for 30-60 days to ensure no data was missed during migration. After this period, if the data is fully reconciled in the Global Lane, the local field can be deleted from the workspace. 

## 6. Avoid the Workfront drift

To prevent Planning from becoming cluttered, do the following: 

* **Understand the abstraction layer**: Every field in Planning should answer a strategic question. If a field is only used for tactical tracking (for example, if the field answers a question like "Was this proof approved?"), keep it in Workfront. 

* **Achieve consolidation first**: If a team wants a new metadata field, invite them to check the Global Taxonomy first. This requires granting team leads read-only access to the Global Taxonomy workspace (see Section 7). By mapping their tactical needs to an existing strategic field, you can prevent unnecessary duplication and maintain reporting integrity.  

## 7. The read-only access visibility model 

You can solve the siloed feeling without the noise of siloed work by allowing teams read-only access to the Global Taxonomy workspace to see what concepts might apply to their own workflows. 

Consider the following: 

* **The problem**: Teams (in the spokes) feel isolated because they only see their own records. 

* **The fix**: Grant teams read-only access to the workspaces designated as Primary for those shared record types. 

    For information, see [Share workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-workspaces.md).

* **The result**: The teams can see the broader enterprise context for inspiration and alignment, but their local workspace remains clean and focused on their specific tasks.  

## 8. Managing growth through workshops 

Scaling Workfront Planning is as much a cultural challenge as a technical one. Use targeted workshops to bridge the governance gap.

The following are ideas for workshops you can have:

* [The "Necessary mess" discovery workshop](#the-necessary-mess-discovery-workshop)
* [The "Strategic visibility" alignment session](#the-strategic-visibility-alignment-session)
* [The "Spoke-to-global" showcase](#the-spoke-to-global-showcase)
* [The "Ongoing support" office hours](#the-ongoing-support-office-hours)

### The "Necessary mess" discovery workshop 

* **Audience**: Regional Marketing leads and Ops champions. 

* **Goal**: Document the current siloed reality, or the actual fragmented operational data. 

* **The message**: "We aren't here to delete your fields. We're here to understand how they link to the global strategy." 

* **Outcome**: A draft mapping of local tactical fields to global strategic lanes.  

### The "Strategic visibility" alignment session 

* **Audience**: High-level Marketing stakeholders (for example, people in leadership roles). 

* **Goal**: Reframe the simplify-first anxiety. 

* **The message**: "We don't need a perfect taxonomy to start. We are using Workfront Planning as the environment to build the perfect taxonomy." 

* **Outcome**: Approval to move forward with Workfront Planning as the reconciliation engine while Workfront remains in its current state.  

### The "Spoke-to-global" showcase 

* **Audience**: New teams exploring Workfront Planning.

* **Goal**: Reduce the siloed feeling. 

* **The message**: "See how Team A's local work automatically feeds the designated Primary Workspace? You can have that same visibility for your work too." 

* **Outcome**: Opt-in from new departments who see the benefit of being connected without losing their local independence.  

### The "Ongoing support" office hours 

* **Audience**: All Workfront Planning users (current and prospective). 

* **Goal**: Provide a recurring, low-stakes environment for troubleshooting and tactical guidance. 

* **The message**: "There are no wrong questions. We are here to help you solve your specific planning challenges in real-time." 

* **Outcome**: Increased user confidence, faster resolution of technical friction, and the identification of new patterns that might warrant global standardization. 

## 9. Staffing for scale: roles and responsibilities 

Success in a managed scaling model requires more than just tool configuration. It requires a clear distribution of roles across the Global and Spoke teams. 

In the subsections below you can find ideas for the main players in managing the scaling model. 

### The enterprise Architect (Central Center of Excellence or Marketing Operations) 

* **Focus**: Enterprise integrity, system performance, and unified data taxonomy. 

* **Responsibilities**: 

    * Manages the Global Taxonomy Workspace. 

    * Facilitates the field-maturity path by promoting local successes to global standards. 

    * Maintains the Primary Workspace views for executive reporting. 

    * Leads the monthly semantic audit across workspaces.  

### The spoke champion (Team Process owner) 

* **Focus**: Team relevance and adoption velocity. 

* **Responsibilities**: 

    * Acts as the single point of contact for the functional team. 

    * Owns the local workspace structure and custom field experiments. 

    * Ensures the team uses the Governed Gateway Forms for data entry. 

    * Participates in the collaborative handshake during harmonization.  

### The executive sponsor (Marketing leadership) 

* **Focus**: Strategic alignment, OKR visibility, and portfolio visualization (for example, global calendaring). 

* **Responsibilities**: 

    * Defines the enterprise Marketing OKRs in the Global Taxonomy workspace. 

    * Champions the value of Visibility Step 1 to other leaders. 

    * Reinforces the 80/20 resource allocation (value over cleanup).  

### The enablement lead (Change Management) 

* **Focus**: Cultural shift and skill development. 

* **Responsibilities**: 

    * Hosts recurring Office Hours and Discovery Workshops touch points. 

    * Maintains the internal Success Story showcase. 

    * Identifies technical friction points for the Enterprise Architect to resolve. 

## 10. Checklist for scaling the next team 

All the learnings from a successful implementation should generate a checklist that you can use for further implementations. 

The following are examples of what a checklist should include: 

* [ ] **Identify the Champion**: Who is the Process Owner or Champion of this new team? 

* [ ] **Define the local delta**: What 2-3 fields does this team need that the Global standard doesn't currently provide? 

* [ ] **Map to global lanes**: Which existing Global fields can satisfy 80% of the future team's needs? 

* [ ] **Grant global  visibility**: Give them read-only access to the relevant Primary workspaces and the Global Taxonomy workspace on Day 1. 

* [ ] **Establish the handoff**: How does their work feed the relevant Primary workspaces? For example, their work might feed into the relevant Primary workspaces via a global record type or a specific lookup field.

## 1. The "Success Trap" 

Sometimes it can feel like the most dangerous phase of WFP adoption is immediately after the first successful use case or POC. Enthusiasm is high, but the fear of "technical debt" and "administrative sprawl" can lead to two equally damaging responses: 

1.  **Over-Governance**: Locking down the system so tightly that new teams revert to spreadsheets. 

2.  **Zero-Governance**: Letting every team create their own fields and record types, recreating the fragmented metadata sprawl found in legacy environments. 

 

## 2. The Core Philosophy: WFP as the "Reconciliation Engine" 

Instead of trying to stop teams from being different, we position WFP as the place where those differences are **made visible so they can be reconciled**. 

 

*   **Managing Adoption Velocity**: It is natural to feel cautious about expanding into a new tool before "cleaning up" existing environments.

We believe the most effective way to lead through this change is to recognize that **visibility is Step 1**. Momentum toward a shared, enterprise-ready tool (moving away from the sprawl of PPTs and spreadsheets) is what ultimately unblocks long-term goals.  

 

    **Recommendation**: Instead of a "Clean Up First" mandate, we recommend allocating a smaller portion of resources to ongoing maintenance and a significantly larger portion to solving pressing business needs. For example, spending a year solely on "cleaning up" taxonomies yields little incremental value. However, delivering **cross-team visibility** (e.g., through a Unified Enterprise Calendar or a consolidated GTM roadmap) provides the transformative value your stakeholders need, while providing the unified data structure you need to govern the environment over time.

Transitioning to WFP doesn't create a mess; it shines a light on the one that already exists. By making these processes visible in a shared environment, you put them in the one place where they can finally be addressed and improved. 

*   **The Progress Signal**: When a team asks for their own fields, it's not "sprawl"—it's **Adoption**. It means they see WFP as their workspace. 

*   **Manage Debt, Don't Hide It**: It is natural to be concerned about the effort required to clean up divergent taxonomies later.

This makes the eventual reconciliation an iterative task rather than a single, overwhelming migration project. 

 

## 3. The "Lanes on a Road" Governance Model 

Scale without debt by defining "Global Lanes" and "Local Playgrounds." 

 

### A. The Global Lanes 

*   **Controlled Objects**: Objects that every team must use for enterprise reporting (e.g., `Strategic Pillar`, `Region`, `Fiscal Quarter`). 

*   **Managed By**: The Central COE/Marketing Ops Admin. 

*   **Rule**: These fields are "Shared" and mandatory. 

 

### B. The Local Playgrounds (Spokes) 

*   **Experimental Objects**: Fields or record types specific to a team's tactical needs (e.g., a Social team's `Influencer Handle` or a Web team's `URL Slug`). 

*   **Managed By**: The Team Lead (with light guidance). 

*   **Rule**: Teams can innovate here. If a "Local" field is adopted by >3 teams, it is "Promoted" to a Global Lane. 

 

## 4. The Governance Paradox: Teams First, Standards Follow 

A common challenge in scaling WFP is deciding which comes first: **Enterprise Governance** or **Team Operational Alignment**.  

 

We believe the most effective way to navigate this is to recognize that enterprise value is built on a two-way street: 

1.  **Teams need relevance**: The enterprise only realizes value when its teams are actively executing. Therefore, governance must **serve the teams** by providing structure that supports their known operational needs. 

2.  **The Enterprise needs visibility**: Leadership can only make informed decisions when data is clean enough to aggregate. Therefore, the teams must **serve the enterprise** by providing the minimum viable metadata required for portfolio visibility. 

 

The goal of "Managed Scaling" is to find the intersection of these two needs—standardizing enough to provide visibility, but not so much that you stall team execution. 

 

### A. Aligning Priorities: Data vs. Visualization 

When scaling, recognize that the definition of "Value" differs between personas: 

*   **The Admin/Product Owner**: Values **unified taxonomies and classifications**. Their goal is a clean data architecture that supports long-term scalability. 

*   **The Stakeholder/Leader**: Values **visualization and insight** (e.g., a Global Calendar or a Portfolio Timeline). Their goal is the "Lightning Moment" that makes the data actionable. 

 

**The Strategy**: Use the stakeholder's need for visualization as the *incentive* for the team's compliance with the admin's need for data standards. You get the unified taxonomy by delivering the "Super Calendar" that leadership demands. 

 

### B. The "Service-Led" Observation Phase 

During early scale-up, the Admin's role is to facilitate this exchange between teams and the enterprise. 

*   **Prioritize Operation over Standardization**: It is better to have teams actively planning in siloed workspaces than to have them stalled by a lack of global definitions. This activity is the "raw data" required to build healthy, real-world standards. 

*   **Identify the "Visibility Minimums"**: Work with leadership to identify the 3-5 fields that *must* be clean for enterprise reporting (e.g., `Strategic Alignment`, `Start Date`, `Budget`). Focus your enforcement energy ONLY here. 

 

### B. Retroactive Harmonization (Governance as a Service) 

Once a pattern of "known needs" emerges across teams, the enterprise can move to consolidate those patterns into a global service. 

1.  **Observe Successful Patterns**: Identify the "winning" taxonomies that teams have already built and adopted. 

2.  **The Collaborative Handshake**: Bring team champions together to refine their local successes into a shared enterprise standard. 

3.  **Deploy as a Service**: Roll out the new global lanes not as a "restriction," but as a way to simplify reporting and cross-team alignment for the people doing the work. 

 

**Key Takeaway**: Governance should be a response to operational success, not a prerequisite for it.  

 

## 5. Scaling Mechanics: The Pattern-Based Growth Model 

Applying this philosophy requires a thoughtful approach to data structure. To avoid "Governance Sprawl," resist the urge to build global fields for every individual request. Instead, use the **Field Maturity Path** to let real-world usage guide your enterprise standards: 

 

1.  **Level 1: Local Experiment**: Team A creates a custom field in their workspace. 

2.  **Level 2: Pattern Recognition**: The Admin notices Teams B and C are using or asking for a similar field. 

3.  **Level 3: Enterprise Standardization**: The Admin creates a single, standardized version of that field as a record type in the **Global Taxonomy Workspace** and syndicates it to teams. 

 

### The Mechanics of "Soft Retirement" 

Because WFP does not currently have a native "Archive" feature for fields, retiring a local field requires a deliberate "Soft Retirement" process to preserve historical data without cluttering the UI: 

 

1.  **Data Migration**: Use a table view (or Fusion) to bulk-copy values from the local "Shadow" field into the new Global Lane field. Ensure the data is validated and cleaned during this move. 

2.  **Rename for Deprecation**: Rename the local field with a prefix like `[DEPRECATED]` or `z_` (e.g., `z_Language (Old)`). This pushes the field to the bottom of field pickers and signals to users that it is no longer the "Source of Truth." 

3.  **Form Removal**: **This is the most critical step.** Remove the deprecated field from all **Record Forms**. This prevents new data from being entered while keeping the old data visible in existing table views or reports if needed. 

4.  **The "Sunset" Period**: Keep the deprecated field (prefixed and off-form) for 30-60 days to ensure no data was missed during migration. After this period, if the data is fully reconciled in the Global Lane, the local field can be deleted from the workspace. 

 

## 6. Avoiding the "Core Drift" (The Abstraction Rule) 

To prevent Planning from becoming as cluttered as Core: 

*   **The Abstraction Layer**: Every field in WFP should answer a **Strategic Question**. If a field is only used for tactical tracking (e.g., "Was this proof approved?"), keep it in Core. 

*   **Consolidation First**: If a team wants a new metadata field, invite them to check the Global Taxonomy first. This requires granting team leads **Read-Only access** to the Global Taxonomy workspace (see Section 7). By mapping their tactical needs to an existing strategic field, you prevent unnecessary duplication and maintain reporting integrity. 

 

## 7. The "Read-Only Access" Visibility Model 

Solve the "Siloed" feeling without the noise of "Siloed" work. 

*   **The Problem**: Teams in spokes feel isolated because they only see their own records. 

*   **The Fix**: Grant teams **Read-Only access to the workspaces designated as 'Primary' for those shared record types**.  

*   **The Result**: They can see the broader enterprise context for inspiration and alignment, but their local workspace remains clean and focused on their specific tasks. 

 

## 8. Managing Growth through Workshops
