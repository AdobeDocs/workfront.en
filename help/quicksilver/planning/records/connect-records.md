# Connect records 

{{planning-important-intro}}

You can connect Adobe Workfront Planning records to one another or to objects from other applications. 

This article describes how you can connect records. For more general information about connecting records, see [Connected records overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/connected-records-overview.md). 

You must first connect two record types to each other, or a record type to an object type from another application. This creates linked record fields. You can then connect records to one another or records to other objects from other applications using the linked record fields. 

Connecting records is similar to connecting records to objects from another application. 

For information about connecting record types to one another or to object types from other applications, see [Connect record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/connect-record-types.md). 

For an example of connecting record types, see [Example of connecting record types and records](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/example-connect-record-types-and-records.md).

You can connect the following: 

* Adobe Workfront Planning records
* Adobe Workfront Planning records with objects from other applications. 

  You can connect records to objects of the types listed below from the following applications:
  
  * Adobe Workfront

    * Projects
    * Portfolios
    * Programs
    * Companies
    * Groups

  * Adobe Experience Manager Assets

    * Image files
    * Folders

  <!--when you add more objects, fix the Access Requirements below which right now refer only to projects-->

## Prerequisites for connecting records

To connect records with other records or objects, you must have the following:

* At least one workspace, record type, and record. 

  For more information, see the following articles:

  * [Create workspaces](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-workspaces.md)
  * [Create record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-record-types.md)
  * [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md)

* Connections between record types, or between record types and objects from other applications. For information, see [Connect record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/connect-record-types.md).

## Connect records from Workfront Planning

You can connect records from Workfront Planning in the following areas of a Planning record:

* The connected record fields in the table view.
* The record's preview or page in the connected record fields on the Details tab.
* The record's preview or page on the Connections tab.

### Connect Adobe Workfront Planning records from the table view or the Details tab of the record page

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click the workspace whose records you want to connect. 

    The workspace opens and the record types display as cards.
1. Click the card of a record type to open the record type page. 
1. Click the name of a table view to open it. 
1. (Optional) Add records to the record type that you selected by adding a new row to the table. For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md). 
1. (Conditional) After you connect the selected record type with another record type, go to the linked record column and double-click the cell corresponding to the record that you want to link with other records.

    ![](assets/connect-other-records-smaller-box-in-table-view.png)

1. Do one of the following:

    * Click a connected record's name from the list to add it to the selected record. The record is added automatically.
    * Start typing the name of a record and click it when it displays in the list. The record is added automatically. 

1. (Optional) If you cannot find a record or an object to connect, and you want to add it, click **+ Add** to add a new record. For more information, see the section "Create records as you connect them" in the article [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).
    
    >[!TIP]
    >
    >    You can open a record's page and connect other records by doing the following in the table view:
    >1. Click the name of the record in the view.
    >1. Find the linked record field and double-click the field (if there are records already connected)
    >Or
    >Click **Connect records** (if the field is empty) to add records from the connected record or object type. 
    >
    >![](assets/connect-records-from-record-page-field.png)

1. (Optional) Click **See all** to display all records. 

1. (Conditional) If you clicked **See all** in the previous step, the **Connect objects** box displays. 

    ![](assets/connected-objects-table-for-records.png)

1. Start typing the name of a record in the search box, then select it when it displays in the list

    Or

    Select the name of one or multiple records in the box, then click **Connect objects**.

    The following are added:

    * The linked records display in the linked record field of the record that you selected in a previous step. 
    * The linked fields are populated with the information from the linked records, if you added linked lookup fields when you connected the record types. 
    
    Updating the linked records updates the linked fields for the records that you are linking from automatically. You cannot manually edit linked fields. 
        
      >[!TIP]
      >
      >*  We use "linked fields" and "lookup fields" interchangeably. 
      >
      >* When you choose to connect multiple records when you connected the record types, the field values from the multiple objects are either displayed separated by commas or are aggregated according to the aggregator you chose when connecting the record types.
    
1. (Optional) Close the record type page and go to the workspace you selected. 
1. Click the card for the record type that you linked to. 

    For example, if you connected the **Campaign** record with the Product record, click the **Product** card. 
  
    The record type card should open in the table view. If not, select a table view. 
  
    Notice that the **Campaign** linked record field displays the names of the campaigns you linked to products in the Product record type page. Updating the Campaign information automatically updates the Campaign linked record field for the Product record type.

### Connect Adobe Workfront Planning records to Workfront objects from the table view or the Details tab of the record page

<!--when we will have more applications to link to from Planning, change the title to something like: Connect Workfront Planning records to objects from other applications-->

After you create a connection between a record type and a Workfront object type, you can connect individual records to objects in Workfront. The Workfront fields you connected are automatically populated on the records you are linking the objects from.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot connect Workfront object types with Workfront Planning record types from Workfront.


{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click the workspace whose records you want to connect.

    The workspace opens and the record types display as cards.
1. Click the card of a record type to open the record type page. 
1. Select a **Table** view from the **View** drop-down menu.

1. Click **New record**  to add individual records to the record type that you selected. For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md). 

1. (Conditional) After you connect the selected record type with a Workfront object type, go to  the linked object column and double-click the cell corresponding to the record that you want to link with objects from Workfront.

    ![](assets/connect-projects-smaller-box-in-table-view.png)

1. Do one of the following:

    * Click an object from the list to add it to the selected record. Objects are listed alphabetically. The object is added automatically.
    * Start typing the name of an object and click it when it displays in the list. The object is added automatically. 

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >You can open a record's page from the view, double-click the linked record field, or click **Connect** in the field to add objects from the connected object type.

1. (Optional) If you cannot find an object to connect, and you want to add it, click **+ Add** to create and add a new project or portfolio. 

    You can only add projects without a template or portfolios when connecting them to Planning records. You cannot add new programs, groups, or companies. 

1. (Optional) Click **See all** to display all objects you have at least permissions to view.

    If you clicked **See all** in the previous step, the **Connect objects** box displays. 

    ![](assets/connect-objects-box-to-select-projects.png)

1. Start typing the name of a Workfront object in the search box, then select it when it displays in the list

    Or

    Select the name of one or multiple objects in the box, then click **Connect objects**. 

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    >* You can only add Workfront objects you have access to view. 
    >
    >* Once you add Workfront objects, everyone with View or higher permissions to the workspace can view the Workfront objects and their field information, regardless of their permissions or access in Workfront.

    The following are added: 

    * The selected Workfront objects are added to the linked record field. 
    * If you added them when you connected the record type with Workfront, the linked fields (or the lookup fields) of the Workfront objects are automatically populated with information from Workfront.

    For more information about connecting record types with objects from another application, see [Connect record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/connect-record-types.md).
     
1. (Optional) Click the name of a Workfront object connected to a Workfront Planning record either in the linked field of a table view or from the linked field in the record page.

    This opens the Workfront object in Workfront, if you have at least View permissions to the object. 

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >* When you choose to connect multiple records when connecting the record types, the values of the lookup fields are either displayed separated by commas or are aggregated according to the aggregator you chose.
   >
   >* A linked record field is not created for the linked Workfront objects in Workfront.

1. (Optional) From the table view of the record type, hover over the column header of the linked Workfront object, and click the drop-down menu, then click **Edit lookup fields**.

1. Add Workfront object fields from the **Unselected fields** area

    Or

    Remove Workfront object fields fro the **Selected fields** area. 

    This adds or removes linked fields from the Workfront Planning records. The information associated with the removed fields remains in Workfront. 


### Connect Workfront Planning records to Adobe Experience Manager objects from the table view or the Details tab of the record page

<!--when we will have more applications to link to from Planning, change the title to something like: Connect Workfront Planning records to objects from other applications-->

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You must have an Adobe Experience Manager Assets license, and your organization's instance of Workfront must be onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform or the Adobe Admin Console to be able to connect Workfront Planning records to Adobe Experience Manager Assets.
>
