## Duplicate a record <!--in a record type table (I don't think you can create them elsewhere right now)-->

You can create records in the table view of a record type page by duplicating an existing one. A record identical to the existing one is created and added under the original record.  


{{step1-to-planning}}
  
1. Click the workspace where you want to add records.

    The workspace opens and the record types display as cards.

1. Click a record type card. For information about creating a record type, see [Create record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-record-types.md). 

    The record type page opens in the view that you last accessed. By default, a record type page opens in the table view. 
    All the records of the selected type display in the view. 

1. (Conditional) Select a table view. 

1. Do one of the following:

    * Hover over the name of a record then click the **More** menu inline with the record name, then click the **Duplicate** icon ![Duplicate icon gray](assets/duplicate-icon-gray.png) .

        ![More menu from record in table view](assets/more-menu-from-record-in-table-view.png)

    * Select a record, then click the **Duplicate** icon ![Duplicate icon white and blue](assets/duplicate-icon-white-and-blue.png) in the toolbar at the bottom of the page. 

        ![Duplicate icon in toolbar in table view](assets/duplicate-icon-in-toolbar-in-table-view.png)

    An identical record with an identical name is created underneath the original record. All fields of the new record are populated with the same information as in the original record.

1. (Optional) Start updating information about the new record in the fields available in the table view, or click the record and update information in the record preview or page. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >  * There are no mandatory fields for records. However, we recommend that you add information for the primary field of a record, as it is helpful to identify records when linking records to one another. For more information about primary fields, see [Manage the table view](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-the-table-view.md) and [Primary field overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/primary-field-overview.md). 
    >
    >  * Fields that refer to other record types or calculated fields are read-only fields. 

    For more information about editing records, see [Edit records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/edit-records.md). 

1. (Optional) Use the following keyboard shortcuts to undo or redo adding new records or their information, when adding them in the table view: 

    * CTRL + Z (⌘ + Z for Mac) to undo a change 
    * CTRL + Shift + Z (⌘ + Shift + Z for Mac) to redo a change.
