## Considerations about deleting records

* You can delete records that you or another user created. 
* You cannot recover deleted records. <!--the above statements (and in the metadata description) will change with access levels and recycle bin??-->
* If the deleted records are linked to other records, the linked records are not deleted, but the information from the deleted record is also deleted. 
* You cannot delete records in bulk. <!--this will probably change-->
* You cannot delete records from the timeline view. 

## Delete records

You can delete a record from the following areas:

* [From the record's page](#delete-a-record-from-the-records-page)
* [From the table view of a record type](#delete-a-record-from-the-record-type-table-view) 

### Delete a record from the record's page

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click the workspace whose records you want to delete.

    The workspace opens and the record types display as cards.

1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 
1. Do one of the following:

    * From a Table view, click the name of a record. 
    * From the Table view, hover over the name of a record, then click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png), then click **View**

        ![](assets/contextual-menu-for-record-row.png)
    * From a Timeline view, click a record bar. 

    The record page opens.  
  
1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record name, then click **Delete**, then **Delete** again to confirm. 

    ![](assets/more-menu-options-from-record-details-page.png) <!--ensure the options have not changed or been renamed-->
    The record is deleted and cannot be recovered. 

### Delete a record from the record type table view

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click the workspace whose records you want to delete.

    The workspace opens and the record types display as cards.

1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 
1. (Conditional) From the **View** drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the table, select a Table view. This should be the default view, unless you viewed the record type in the timeline view when you accessed it last. 

    The records associated with the selected record type display in the table view. 
1. Do one of the following:

    * Right-click a record row, then click **Delete**. 
    * Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record name, then click **Delete**

        ![](assets/contextual-menu-for-record-row.png)
    
    * Click the **Open details** icon ![](assets/open-details-icon-in-table-name-field.png) to open the box with the record's detailed information, and click **More** ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record name, then **Delete**.

    The record is deleted and cannot be recovered.

1. (Optional) Use the following keyboard shortcuts to undo or redo deleting a record:

    * CTRL + Z (⌘ + Z for Mac) to undo a change 
    * CTRL + Shift + Z (⌘ + Shift + Z for Mac) to redo a change
