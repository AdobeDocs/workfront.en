# Create objects using Adobe Workfront Planning record automations

<!--add screen shots when UI is finalized AND redo all the steps - some things got changed and moved around-->
<!--when you make this public, add this to the metadata above (and take the "hide" tags out):

feature: Workfront Planning
role: User, Admin
author: Alina, Becky
recommendations: noDisplay, noCatalog

-->

<!--add a new section to this article to mention a new way to create objects: help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md-->
<!-- add a new section to this article to mention a new way to create WF objects from Planning: help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-workfront-objects-from-workfront-planning.md-->

<!-- if they give access to use the automation to people with LESS than Manage permissions to a workspace, split this article in two: the Configure section should be for admins and the "Use a Workfront Planning automation to create an object" should be for all other users-->

You can configure automations in Adobe Workfront Planning that, when activated, create objects in Workfront or records Workfront Planning. The created objects or records are automatically linked to the records you are triggering the automation from. 

You can configure and activate the automation in the record's page in Workfront Planning. The connected object that is created is placed in the connected field of the record type you run the automation from. 

For example, you could create an automation that takes a Workfront Planning campaign and creates a project in Workfront to track that campaign's progress. The project would be connected to the Workfront Planning campaign in the Connected Project field on the campaign.

For more information on connected records, see [Connected records overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/connected-records-overview.md).

## Considerations about creating objects and records using an automation

* The new object or record name is the same as the record name from which you create it. <!--take this out when they add the field mapping - no longer just the name of the original record-->
* New objects don't override existing ones in the same field. 
* The automation creates additional objects only in the Many to many or One to many connection type fields. 

## Configure an automation in Workfront Planning

You must configure an automation for a record type in Workfront Planning, before you can use it to create objects.

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click a record type card, then click the name of a record. 

   The record type page opens. 
1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record type name, then click **Manage automations**. 

   The list of available automations opens.

1. Click **New automation** in the upper-right corner of the screen. The **New automation** box opens.
1. Update the following fields:

   * Replace **Untitled automation** with the text that you want to appear on the automation button. Users will click this button when using the automation to create a Workfront object or a Planning record.
   * **Description**: Add a description to identify the purpose of the automation.
1. Click **Save**.
   The automation details page opens. 

1. On the automation's details page, update the following fields in the **Triggers** section: 

   * **Trigger**: Select the action that will trigger the automation. For example, select **Button click**. <!--update this step with a list of all possible triggers; right not only Button click is available-->

1. Update the following fields in the **Actions** section: <!--submitted bugs for these fields - see if they need changing here-->
   * **Object type**: Select the object that you want the automation to create. This is a required field.

      You can create the following objects from Workfront Planning records: 

      * Project
      * Portfolio
      * Program
      * Group
      * Record
1. (Conditional) Depending on what type of object you want to create, update the following fields:

   * **Project**: 
      * **Connected field where the object is created**: This is the connected field where the new project will display. This is a required field
      * **Template from which to create the project**: Select a project template that Workfront will use to create the project.  
   * **Portfolio**:
      * **Connected field where the object is created**: This is the connected field where the new portfolio will display. This is a required field.
      * **Custom form to attach to the new portfolio**: Select a custom form to attach to the new portfolio. You must create a portfolio custom form before you can select it. 
   * **Program**: 
      * **Connected field where the object is created**: This is the connected field where the new program will display. This is a required field.
      * **Program portfolio**: Select a portfolio where the new program will be added. This is a required field.
      * * **Custom form to attach to the new program**: Select a custom form to attach to the new program. You must create a program custom form before you can select it. 
   * **Group**:
      * **Connected field where the object is created**: This is the connected field where the new group will display. This is a required field.
      * **Custom form to attach to the new group**: Select a custom form to attach to the new program. You must create a program custom form before you can select it. 
   * **Record**: 
      * **Connected record type**: Select the record type you want to create. 
      * **Connected field where the record is created**: This is the connected field where the new record will display. This is a required field. <!--this might need revision as right now it shows the field on the connected record table where the current record will display; submitted a bug to correct this label-->
      * **Map fields**
         * **Transfer from**: Select fields from the record type the automation is created for to map them to the fields of the connected record type. 
      * **Transfer to**: Select fields from the newly created record that will populate with information from the record you are running the automation from. 
1. (Optional and conditional) If you selected to create a record, click **Add fields** to map additional lookup fields from one record to another.
1. (Optional and conditional) If you don't have a connection field for a Workfront object type, click the **Create a connection field** icon ![](assets/create-a-connection-field-icon.png) to add a field. 
1. Click **Save** in the upper-right corner of the automation details page. 

   The automation displays on the list of automations, and is available to use in records.
1. (Optional) To edit, disable, or delete an automation, do the following:

   1. From the list of automations, hover over the name of a saved automation, then click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png).

   1. Click **Edit** to update information about and configure fields on the automation.
   1. Click **Disable** to remove the automation from the table view and prevent users from using it to create records or objects. To make it available again, click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) again, then click **Activate**.
   1. Click **Delete** to delete the automation. A deleted automation cannot be recovered. Records that have been created using the automation remain connected to the record originally selected.  

## Use a Workfront Planning automation to create an object or a record

1. In Workfront Planning, open the record type page that contains the records you want to use to create Workfront objects or Planning records. 
1. Open the table view. 
1. Select one or more records.
   
   A blue bar displays at the bottom of the table with additional buttons, including automation buttons. 
1. Click the automation button near the lower-right corner of the screen. 

   ![Automation button](assets/automation-custom-button.png)

   A confirmation message displays at the bottom of the screen, if the automation successfully created an object or a record. 

   The new object displays in the connected field you indicated in the setup of the automation button. You might need to refresh your page before viewing the new object. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >We recommend checking that the object was created and connected as expected.

1. (Optional) Click the new object in the connected field. The object page opens and you can make additional changes to the new object.
