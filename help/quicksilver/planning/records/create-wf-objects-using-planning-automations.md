# Create Workfront Objects using Workfront Planning record automations

You can configure automations in Workfront Planning that, when activated, create objects in Workfront.

For example, you could create an automation that takes a Workfront Planning campaign and creates a project in Workfront to track that campaign's progress. The project would be connected to the Workfront Planning record.

For more information on connected records, see [Connected records overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/connected-records-overview.md).
