# Add a Connected records page to a record

You can view information from connected records or objects by adding a tab for a Connected records page to a record. This adds the connected records in a table view to the tab.

Consider the following when adding a Connected records page to a record: 

* You can add a Connected records page to a record after you connected record or object types to the record type from the table view of a record type.

* You can add a Connected records page from a record's preview area or the record's page.

* Connected records pages display only the connected objects or records from one object or record type in a table view. The page does not display all records of that type. 

* You can add Connected records pages for the following connected record or object types:

   * Workfront Planning record types
   * Workfront projects, programs, portfolios, groups, or companies. You can view the connected Workfront objects even when you do not have permissions to access them in Workfront.
