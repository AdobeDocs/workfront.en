# Add a cover image to a record

{{planning-important-intro}}

You can personalize records by adding a cover image to the record page in Adobe Workfront Planning, when editing a record.

For information about editing records, see [Edit records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/edit-records.md). 

You must create record types before you can start creating and editing records. 

For information, see [Create record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/create-record-types.md).

## Considerations about record page cover images

You can personalize a record's page by adding a cover image to it. 

Consider the following: 

* A cover image is unique to one record, and it does not apply to all records of the same type. 
* You can add only image files as cover images.
   <!--above: when you know exactly what type of files are allowed, add the exact extensions above-->
* You can add a cover image to individual records from the record preview in any view, or from the record page. 
* You cannot add cover images from a record view. 
* Workfront automatically uploads a cover image every time you create a record. You can later modify this image.

## Add a cover image to a record

You can personalize a record by adding a cover image at the top of the record preview or page.
