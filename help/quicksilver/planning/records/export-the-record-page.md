## Considerations about exporting a record's details:

* You can export a record's details to the following file formats:

    * .docx Word
    * .pdf

* You can export only the Details tab of a record's page or preview area. 

* The exported file preserves the layout of the record page, including the thumbnail and the cover images. 

## Export a record's details

{{step1-to-planning}}

1. Click the card of a workspace. 

    The workspace opens and the record types display on cards. 

1. Click a record type card.
    The record type page opens and all records of that type display. 

1. From any view, click the name of a record. 

    The record's preview box opens. 

1. (Optional) Click the **Open in new tab** icon ![Open details in a new tab icon](assets/open-details-in-a-new-tab-icon.png) to open the record's page.

1. Choose the **Details** tab. The Details tab should open by default.

1. Click the **Export** menu ![Export icon in record details page](assets/export-icon-in-record-details-page.png) either in the preview or the record's page, then click one of the following:

   * **Microsoft Word**
   * **Adobe PDF**

    A Word (.docx) or a PDF file downloads and is saved to your computer.

    The name of the exported file is the Primary field of the record. 

    ![Exported word file](assets/exported-word-file.png)

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >    Additional information that does not display on the page and is only visible after clicking Show more in the record details area does not display in the exported PDF file. Only the information visible on the page displays in the exported file. 


1. (Optional) Go to the downloaded file, open it and either edit it (if it is a Word file), or share it with others.
