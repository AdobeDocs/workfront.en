## Share record links from the record type table view

{{step1-to-planning}}

   The workspace that you accessed last opens. 
1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 
1. (Conditional) From the **View** drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the table, select a table view. This should be the default view, unless you viewed the record type in the timeline view when you accessed it last. 

    The records associated with the selected record type display in the table view. 
1. Right-click a record row

    Or 

    Hover over a record's name, click the **More** menu ![More menu](assets/more-menu.png), then click **Copy link**.

    ![Contextual menu for record row](assets/contextual-menu-for-record-row.png)

    The link is copied to your clipboard. 

1. Paste the link into an email, or chat window, to share with other users. When users receive the link, it opens the record page. 

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >The fields in the record page are the same fields available in the Table view of the record. 


    <!--add there when it will be available: if they have access to this record-->

## Share all records in a workspace by sharing the workspace

You can share all records in a workspace when you share the workspace with others. 

Only users with Manage permissions to a workspace can share it with others. 

For more information, see [Share a workspace](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-workspaces.md).

<div class="preview">

## Share all records in a record type by sharing the record type

In the Production environment, records inherit permissions from the workspace. 

In the Preview environment, records inherit permissions from the record type. 

By default, record types inherit permissions from the workspace. 

However, you can do any of the following:

* Turn off inherited permissions from the workspace on a record type. This removes permissions from the records. 
* Manually grant permissions to users to a record type, even when they have no permissions to the workspace. This automatically gives them View permissions to the workspace. This grants permissions to users to the records. 

Only users with Manage permissions to a workspace can share its record types and records with others. 

For more information, see [Share record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-record-types.md).
