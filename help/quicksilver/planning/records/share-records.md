# Share records

{{planning-important-intro}}

To collaborate with other users, you can share records with others. 

You can share an Adobe Workfront Planning record in the following ways: 

* Copy the link of the record page from your browser when the page is open. 

* Copy a link to the record's page when viewing records in the record type's table view.   

* You can share all records in a workspace with other users by sharing the workspace. For more information, see [Share a workspace](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-workspaces.md).

This article describes how you can copy a link to a record's page from the table view of a record type.

<!--Maybe enable this at GA - but Workfront Planning is not supposed to have Access controls in the Workfront Access Level: 
>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see [Create or modify custom access levels](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md). -->

<!-- Notes to add for the table: for the "Workfront plans" row: the above is only for closed beta; when going to GA - activate the following plans:    
<p>Current plan: Prime and Ultimate</p>
<p>Legacy plan: Enterprise</p>-->

<!-- Notes for the table: for the "Workfront access" row: <p>For more information, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md" class="MCXref xref">Adobe Workfront licenses overview</a>.</p>--> 

## Share record links from the record type table view

{{step1-to-planning}}

   The workspace that you accessed last opens. 
1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 
1. (Conditional) From the **View** drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the table, select a table view. This should be the default view, unless you viewed the record type in the timeline view when you accessed it last. 

    The records associated with the selected record type display in the table view. 
1. Right-click a record row

    Or 

    Hover over a record's name, click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png), then click **Copy link**.

    ![](assets/contextual-menu-for-record-row.png)

    The link is copied to your clipboard. 

1. Paste the link into an email, or chat window, to share with other users. When users receive the link, it opens the record page. 

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >The fields in the record page are the same fields available in the Table view of the record. 


    <!--add there when it will be available: if they have access to this record-->

## Share all records in a workspace by sharing the workspace

You can share all records in a workspace when you share the workspace with others. 

Only users with Manage permissions to a workspace can share it with others. 

For more information, see [Share a workspace](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-workspaces.md).
