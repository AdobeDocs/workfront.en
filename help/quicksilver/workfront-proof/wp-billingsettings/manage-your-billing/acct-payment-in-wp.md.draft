## Payment by Credit Card {#payment-by-credit-card}

We accept Visa, American Express, and MasterCard.

![Accepted_Credit_Cards.png](assets/accepted-credit-cards-350x84.png)

If a credit card added to your account is being declined it may be because:

* Expiration date has passed
* Credit limit has been reached
* Transaction is blocked by the card provider

In these cases, please&nbsp;update your credit card details or add a new card to your account. If the payments&nbsp;are being blocked due to international nature of the transactions, please get in touch with your credit card provider to authorize these payments.

&nbsp;Once this is completed, please reach out to our [Finance team](mailto:finance@proofhq.com)&nbsp;so they can re-process the payment for you. The paid invoice will be available in the Billing history section right after collecting the payment.

If your account is on a paid plan, but you were paying by bank transfer, you can enter your Credit Card details:

* In the Change payment details pop-up
* In the Change plan pop-up after selecting the Credit Card as your new payment method for your&nbsp;order  
  See [Choosing Your Payment Method in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-billingsettings/manage-your-billing/choose-payment-method-in-wp.md) for more information.&nbsp;

The added card will be used to collect payment for the next transaction.

## Payment Via Bank Transfer {#payment-via-bank-transfer}

This payment method is available for the annual subscriptions only.

All the details for the Bank transfer are included in the invoices you receive. For more information, see [Downloading Your Workfront Proof Invoice](../../../workfront-proof/wp-billingsettings/manage-your-billing/download-wp-invoice.md).
