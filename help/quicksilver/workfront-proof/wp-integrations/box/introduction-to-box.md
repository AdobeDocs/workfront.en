# Introduction to the [!DNL Workfront] Proof and Box integration

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Our integration with the Box online file sharing and content management system allows you to create new proofs and new proof versions&nbsp;directly from files in your Box account. For information about Box, see www.box.com.

Our&nbsp;folder syncing functionality lets you&nbsp;synchronize a Box folder with a folder in [!DNL Workfront] Proof. When you add a file, or a new version of a file, to synchronized folder in Box, the file is also added to the associated folder in Workfront Proof. For more information, see [Sync Box Folders With Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-integrations/box/sycn-box-folder.md).
