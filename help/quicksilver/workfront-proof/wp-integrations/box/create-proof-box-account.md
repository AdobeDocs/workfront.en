# Create a Proof via Your Box Account

>[!IMPORTANT]

>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

It's easy to create proofs and new proof versions via your Box account.

## Creating a New Proof from a File in Box

1. Log into your Box account and click on the **[!UICONTROL More Options]** button next to the file you would you want to proof in Workfront Proof.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL More Actions]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Review with Workfront Proof]**.\
   If you are already logged in to Workfront Proof, a pop-up window will appear with the file uploaded on the&nbsp;New proof page.\
   Here you can add more files (if you wish to create multiple proofs in one go or to combine multiple files into one proof), add people to the proof, set a deadline for them, add tags and pick the folder for the proof\
   You can also choose to make this proof a new version of an existing proof

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**&nbsp;to create the proof and send it to your reviewers.

   A comment is added to the file in Box with a personal link to the proof in [!DNL Workfront] Proof.

   * If you have your own branded Workfront Proof login page you will be taken to that page instead of the standard Workfront Proof login page. See [Branding](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000921208-Branding) for more information.
   * If you have enabled the Single Sign-On functionality in your [!DNL Workfront] Proof account you will be taken to the SSO login page and asked to enter your Single Sign-On login credentials, but only if you're are using the same email address for your Box account and [!DNL Workfront] Proof. See [Single Sign-On in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/managing-security/single-sign-on-overview.md) for more information.
   * If you are not using the same email address for both your Box account and your [!DNL Workfront] Proof account, you will always be taken to the standard [!DNL Workfront] Proof login page.

## Creating a New Version of a Proof Via a [!UICONTROL File in] Box

It's easy to create a new version&nbsp;of a proof using a new version of the file from your Box account. See for more information.

1. Follow the steps above.
1. While on the [!DNL New proof] page, click on the [!UICONTROL New version] link (1) to go to the [!DNL New version] page where you will be able to complete the process of creating a new version of an existing proof.\
   If you have already created a proof via Box using a previous version of the file, the notification on the top of the page will reflect this
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Existing proof]** pop-up, select the parent version of your new proof. If the previous version of the proof was also submitted from Box, this proof will appear in the [!UICONTROL Matching proofs] section on the top of the list. You can also select your parent version from the [!UICONTROL Other proofs] section.&nbsp;
1. If you can't see the proof you'd like to choose in the list, you can:

   * Sort the columns by clicking on the column header.
   * Filter by name - type in the name of the previous proof and apply the filter by clicking the filter icon - only available if you have more than one page of items on the list.
   * Identify your other Box submissions by the Box logo.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to go to&nbsp;the New version page where you will be able to do any of the following:

   * Change the parent version by clicking **[!UICONTROL Change proof]**.
   * Cancel creating a new version by clicking a trash icon. Proceed with submitting your file as a new proof.

1. Populate the **[!UICONTROL New version]** page as normal (as if you'd uploaded the file directly from within Workfront Proof), then click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to go&nbsp;to the Proof details page.\
   Here you can access the new version by clicking **[!UICONTROL Go to proof]**.
