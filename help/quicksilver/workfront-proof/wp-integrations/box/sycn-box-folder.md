# Sync Box Folders With [!DNL Workfront] Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can synchronize a Box folder with a folder in Workfront Proof. Every change you make to your files in the Box folder will be reflected in Workfront Proof (so uploading a new file, adding a new version, renaming of a file, etc).

For more information about folders, see [Manage Folders and their Contents in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/manage-folders-and-contents.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only users with profiles of Managers or higher are able to sync folders.&nbsp;The Box user who uploads the file to a folder synced with [!DNL Workfront] Proof, will be made the owner of the proof created in [!DNL Workfront] Proof (if they are a user within the same [!DNL Workfront] Proof account). If the Box user is a user in a different [!DNL Workfront] Proof account or does not have an account with [!DNL Workfront] Proof, the person who created the sync between the folders will become the owner of the proof. For more information, see *"Editing User Profiles and Permissions."*

To synchronize a Box folder with a folder in [!DNL Workfront] Proof:

1. In your Box account, go to the [!UICONTROL All Files and Folders] page.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More options]** menu next to the folder you want to sync with [!DNL Workfront] Proof (1).
1. Select **[!UICONTROL More Actions]** (2).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Sync with Workfront Proof]** (3).
1. In the [!UICONTROL Sync] folder box that appears (if you are logged into Workfront Proof), do one of the following:

   * Click a [!DNL Workfront] Proof folder name to sync it with the corresponding folder in Box (4).
   * Click **[!UICONTROL New folder]** to create a new folder in [!DNL Workfront] Proof (5).\

      ![folder_sync_2.jpg](assets/folder-sync-2-350x231.jpg)If you chose to create a new folder, you are prompted to provide details about the new folder.

1. Click **Save**.\
   The [!UICONTROL Folder details] page for the synced folder opens in [!DNL Workfront] Proof. This page contains information about the folder.\
   This page also lets you pause and disable the sync. If you pause the sync, the folder will no longer be updated with the changes from Box, but the sync can be resumed at any time. Disabling the sync means that the connection between the folders is broken and the sync would need to be re-established from the Box account.\
   The Folder details page contains the following information and functions in relation to your folder in Box:

   * **Pause syncing**: The [!DNL Workfront] Proof folder will no longer be updated with the changes from Box. Sync can be resumed at any time (1).
   * **Disable folder sync**: Connection between folders is lost, and the sync will have to be setup again from the Box account (2).

   * &nbsp;Only the user who started the folder sync can disable or pause it. For more information, see&nbsp; [Manage Folders and their Contents in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/manage-folders-and-contents.md).
   * **Go to Box folder**: If you shared the folder URL (in the Box folder options), this option will become available and will take you straight to the Box folder (3).
   * **[!UICONTROL Folder] sync details**: This section contains information about the Box folder (4).
   * **Box folder link**: URL to the Box folder (5).
   * **Activity:** Shows you the activity logs of the [!DNL Workfront] Proof folder, here you can check who started the folder sync (6).

>* You can also sync the Box folder from the Folder options menu.

>* If you have enabled the [!UICONTROL Single Sign-On (SSO)] functionality in your [!DNL Workfront] Proof account, you will be taken to the SSO login page and asked to enter your SSO login credentials, but only if you are are using the same email address for your Box account and [!DNL Workfront] Proof. If you need more information, see [[!UICONTROL Single Sign-On] in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/managing-security/single-sign-on-overview.md).
>* If you are not using the same email address for both your Box account and your [!DNL Workfront] Proof account, you will always be taken to the standard [!DNL Workfront] Proof login page.
