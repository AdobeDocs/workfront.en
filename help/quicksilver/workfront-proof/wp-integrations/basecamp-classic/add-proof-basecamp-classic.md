# Add a Proof to a Basecamp Classic Project

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

After you set up your [!DNL Basecamp Classic] integration you can start adding proofs to projects within your [!DNL Basecamp Classic] account.

After adding a proof to a [!DNL Basecamp Classic] project, your reviewers will receive an email notification which will contain a link to view the proof in [!DNL Workfront] Proof and a link to open the message in their [!DNL Basecamp] Classic account.

Once they open the message they will be able to comment and make decisions on the proof from within their Basecamp account.

For more information, see [Review a Proof in Basecamp Classic](../../../workfront-proof/wp-integrations/basecamp-classic/review-proof-basecamp-classic.md).
