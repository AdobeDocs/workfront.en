# Add a Proof to a Basecamp Classic Project

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

After you set up your Basecamp Classic integration you can start adding proofs to projects within your Basecamp Classic account.

After adding a proof to a Basecamp Classic project, your reviewers will receive an email notification which will contain a link to view the proof in Workfront Proof and a link to open the message in their Basecamp Classic account.

Once they open the message they will be able to comment and make decisions on the proof from within their Basecamp account.

For more information, see [Review a Proof in Basecamp Classic](../../../workfront-proof/wp-integrations/basecamp-classic/review-proof-basecamp-classic.md).

## Adding a New Proof to a Basecamp Classic Project

>[!NOTE]

>Before you add a proof to Basecamp Classic, you must ensure that your Basecamp integration is enabled and that you have the relevant Basecamp account chosen in your Personal settings (as you can integrate with more than one Basecamp account, but only add proofs to one Basecamp account at a time). For information about your settings, see [Personal Settings.](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000921168-Personal-settings)
