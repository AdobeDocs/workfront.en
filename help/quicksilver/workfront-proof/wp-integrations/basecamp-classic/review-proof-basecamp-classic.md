Basecamp is an online project management tool developed by 37signals. If you use Basecamp for project management you can offer your project team richer review and approval tools using Workfront Proof.

## Understanding Proof Reviews in Basecamp Classic

When integrated with Workfront Proof, Basecamp allows users to do the following with proofs:

* Users can review and approve proofs within Basecamp Classic.
* Users have review tools readily available.
* Project review teams receive a message in Basecamp with a mini proof for review and approval.
* Users can switch to a full-page proof for review and approval.
* Users can add comments and markups to both mini- and full-sized proofs.  
* Once a comment has been replied to, it cannot be edited/deleted. For information about comments, see [Comment on a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/comment-on-proof.md).
* Reviewers can respond to the and markups made by other reviewers. For information about comments, see [Comment on a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/comment-on-proof.md).
* Users are alerted when a new version of proof is available.
* Users who are not Workfront Proof users can work on a proof in Basecamp.

## Viewing a Proof via the Notification Email

If you link a proof to Basecamp, Workfront Proof sends a proof notification email (1) to all reviewers, containing the following information:

* `Proof details` (2): Displays information about the proof. The information that displays depends on how your Workfront administrator has configured Basecamp.
* `Go to Proof link` (3): Opens the proof in Workfront.&nbsp;
* `Basecamp URL` (4): Opens the proof in Basecamp. If non-Basecamp reviewers are added to the proof, their email notification does not include the Basecamp link.
* `Proof progress` (5): Lists the stages of approval and displays the Proof progress indicators.
* `Stage` (6): Lists the reviewers and their individual progress.

## Reviewing a Proof in Basecamp

The mini proof in Basecamp provides you with the tools you need to add and to make [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md) on the proof. All users assigned to the project see your markups and comments and can respond with their own comments in a real time.

When you open the proof, the proof displays in the proofing window (1) and the name of the proof and version number displays in the upper-left corner (2).

To review the proof:

1. To add a comment, click Comment&nbsp;(3) at the top of the proof, and type your comment.  
   There is no need to send a response to the Basecamp message, as the comments and [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md) saved to the proof (similar to reviewing a proof within Workfront Proof).

1. To add a decision, click&nbsp;Decision&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;at the top of the proof, and select your approval decision.  
   For more information on making decisions on a proof, see [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md#making-a-decision-on-a-proof).

Other features on the proof window include:

* `Action menus` (4): Allows you to select settings for the proof.
* `Full-screen button` (5): Allows you to toggle between full-screen and mini-proof.
* `Sidebar` (6): Allows you to expand or shrink view of proof.
* `Username` (7): Displays your username if you are logged into Workfront.
* `Zoom tools` (8): Allows you to magnify an area of the proof.
