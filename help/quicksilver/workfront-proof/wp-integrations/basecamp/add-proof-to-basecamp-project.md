# Add a Proof to a Basecamp Project

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

After you set up your [!DNL Basecamp] integration, you can start adding proofs to projects within your [!DNL Basecamp] account.

Reviewers on the proof will then receive a message in their Basecamp account with the [!DNL Workfront] Proof miniproof embedded. Once they open the message they will be able to comment and make decisions on the proof from within their Basecamp account. For more information, see&nbsp; [Review a Proof in Basecamp](../../../workfront-proof/wp-integrations/basecamp/review-proof-basecamp.md).

As a proof creator, you will want to make sure that your Basecamp integration is enabled and that you have the relevant Basecamp account chosen in your Personal settings (as you can integrate with more than one Basecamp account).&nbsp;

After adding a proof to a Basecamp project, your reviewers will receive an email notification which will contain a link to view the proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof] and a link to open the message in their Basecamp account.

## Adding a New Proof to a Basecamp project

1. Create a proof, as described in [Generate Proofs in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md).&nbsp;
1. If you would like to notify your reviewers by email, ensure that&nbsp;**Notify people by email**&nbsp;is enabled.\
   Note that your Basecamp reviewers will receive an additional Basecamp message.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Organize]** section, click **[!UICONTROL Add proof to a Basecamp project]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Add to Basecamp]** box that appears, click **[!UICONTROL Refresh the data]** to synchronize with Basecamp.

1. Select your Basecamp project.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL People on the project]**, select the check boxes for the reviewers in your [!DNL Basecamp] Classic account that you want to add to the proof.\
   Selected reviewers will receive a message in [!DNL Basecamp] for this proof and an email notification from [!DNL Workfront] Proof.

1. Click **OK**.&nbsp;
1. Apply any other settings you require for your proof (as normal) and click **Save** to submit your proof.&nbsp;

>[!NOTE]
>
>If reviewer defaults have been changed, you must refresh the Basecamp data before the new defaults will be used. To refresh the Basecamp data, click the [!UICONTROL Refresh] link on the Basecamp popup in [!DNL Workfront] Proof.&nbsp;Include your own name if you also want to receive the message in Basecamp.

>If you do not have a Basecamp session open in another browser window, you must sign in to your Basecamp account before you can see the message in Basecamp.

## Adding an Existing Proof to a Basecamp Project

   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Refresh the data]** to synchronize with Basecamp Classic before proceeding.
   1. Select your Basecamp project.&nbsp;
   1. Under **[!UICONTROL People on the project]**, select the check boxes for the reviewers in your [!DNL Basecamp] Classic account that you want to add to the proof.
   1. Reviewers appear in their default role/email alert. The selected reviewers receive a message in Basecamp for this proof and also an email notification from [!DNL Workfront] Proof.
   1. If reviewer defaults have been changed, you must refresh the Basecamp data before the new defaults will be used. To refresh the Basecamp data click the "refresh" link on the Basecamp pop-up in Workfront Proof. Include your own name if you also want to receive the message in Basecamp&nbsp;

1. Click **OK**.&nbsp;

After you have added the proof to your [!DNL Basecamp Classic] project, you will see additional options showing in the [!UICONTROL More sharing options] section of the Proof details page (for information about this page, see [Manage Proof Details in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md).&nbsp;You will be able to:
