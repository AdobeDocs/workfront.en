# Add a Proof to a Basecamp Project

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

After you set up your [!DNL Basecamp] integration, you can start adding proofs to projects within your [!DNL Basecamp] account.

Reviewers on the proof will then receive a message in their [!DNL Basecamp] account with the [!DNL Workfront Proof] miniproof embedded. Once they open the message they will be able to comment and make decisions on the proof from within their [!DNL Basecamp] account. For more information, see  [Review a Proof in [!DNL Basecamp]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-integrations/basecamp/review-proof-basecamp.md).

As a proof creator, you will want to make sure that your [!DNL Basecamp] integration is enabled and that you have the relevant [!DNL Basecamp] account chosen in your [!UICONTROL Personal settings] (as you can integrate with more than one [!DNL Basecamp] account). 

After adding a proof to a [!DNL Basecamp] project, your reviewers will receive an email notification which will contain a link to view the proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof] and a link to open the message in their [!DNL Basecamp] account.
