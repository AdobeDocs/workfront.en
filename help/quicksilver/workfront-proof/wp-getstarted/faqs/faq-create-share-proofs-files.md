# FAQ - Create and share proofs and files

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

## What is a proof?

### Answer

A proof is a static, audio, or video file that is available for review in the proofing viewer. Reviewers added to a proof have a set of tools available to them to make comments and decisions on the proof. 

## What file types are supported?

### Answer

Proofs can be created from static, audio, and video files. You can't upload files larger than 4GB. [!DNL Workfront] supports over 150 file types (see [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md) for a full list).

## What is the difference between a proof and a file?

### Answer

When you upload a file to [!DNL Workfront Proof], the system stores the file in your [!DNL Workfront Proof] account. When you share it, [!DNL Workfront Proof] emails your recipients a link that they can click to download the file. You can share any file type you want.

When you create a proof from a file you have uploaded to [!DNL Workfront Proof], you can make the file available for review in the proofing viewer. Reviewers receive an email with a link to the proof. When they open the proof, they see the proof image and can add comments and make decisions on it. You can create proofs using files from the list of supported file types. You can also create proofs using URLs for websites and other web content.

For a full list of supported file types, see [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md). 

## How do I create a proof?

### Answer

You can create proofs from static files, audio files, video files, and URLs (see ).

To create a proof in the account, you need to be a user with the right permission profile (see [[!UICONTROL Proof Permissions Profiles] in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md)). 

If you upload multiple files at the same time, you create multiple proofs that you can send to the same group of reviewers using one email. If your organization has an [!UICONTROL Enterprise] or [!UICONTROL Unlimited] account, you can combine files into a single proof (see [Create a multi-page proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-multi-page-proof.md)).

## What are proof roles and email alerts?

### Answer

Proof roles define what actions a reviewer needs to take on a proof. There are different role options you can use for reviewers when you create a proof, depending on whether you want them to be able to make comments, make decisions, and so on. For more information, see [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).

Email alerts update reviewers on a proof's progress (they are different from new proof and late proof notifications). You can select different options for different reviewers, depending on each reviewer's role on the proof. For more information, see [Create an advanced proof with an [!UICONTROL Automated workflow]](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-automated-proof-workflow.md).

## Can I create a proof from multiple files?

### Answer

Combining multiple files into a single proof is a feature available on [!UICONTROL Enterprise] and [!UICONTROL Unlimited] edition plans. This option is possible only for static files, not for video files. For more information, see  [Create a multi-page proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-multi-page-proof.md).

## Can I create proofs from URLs?

### Answer

Yes, you can create proofs from websites and other web content. When you add a URL to create a proof, you can specify whether you want a static proof or an interactive proof:

* In an interactive proof, reviewers can navigate and interact as they normally would with the website or other web content such as ads with streaming video or audio, [!DNL Flash] elements in an ad, HTML animations, and interactive banners. For more information, see [Create a proof for interactive content in a ZIP file](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof-interactive-content-.md).
* For a static proof, [!DNL Workfront] takes a set a screenshots of the pages and subpages you specify. Hyperlinks are live in the proof, so you can test whether or not they lead to the correct destination. For more information, see [Create a static proof for a website or other web content](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-static-proof-website-other-web-content.md).

You can add multiple URLs at once if you separate them with a space. Note that combining is only available on [!UICONTROL Enterprise] and [!UICONTROL Unlimited] edition plans.

## Can people who don't have a login create proofs in my account?

### Answer

You need login credentials to create proofs directly in a [!DNL Workfront Proof] account.

## What does sharing a proof mean?

### Answer

Sharing a proof gives reviewers access to it so that they can add comments and markups and make decisions on it. Guest reviewers access proofs from the email notification they receive. Reviewers with their own [!DNL Workfront Proof] account can access proofs on the [!UICONTROL Dashboard]. 

## How do I share a proof?

### Answer

When you are creating a proof, you can add reviewers in the [!UICONTROL Workflow] section of the [!UICONTROL New Proof] page. When the proof is ready, [!DNL Workfront Proof] sends an email to the reviewers containing a link to the proof.

If you have sufficient rights on a proof, you can use the proofing viewer, your [!UICONTROL Dashboard], or any of the list views to add reviewers to an existing proof (see [Share a Proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md) and [Manage Items on the [!UICONTROL Views] Page in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-items-on-views-page.md).

Adding reviewers is the most common way to share proofs. If you'd like to explore other available options, see:

* [Share proof links in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof-links.md) 
* [Share the Public URL in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-public-url.md) 
* [Subscribe to a Proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/subscribe-to-proof.md) 
* [Create a Mini proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/create-mini-proof.md)

## Do you have to be a user to review a proof?

### Answer

No. Guest reviewers (people without [!DNL Workfront Proof] login credentials) can access a proof from the proof email notification they receive. You can share a proof with as many guests as you want.

It is possible to restrict sharing proofs to people with [!DNL Workfront Proof] login credentials. This adds another layer of security to your proofs. For enhanced security, system administrators of organizations with [!UICONTROL Enterprise] and [!UICONTROL Unlimited] plans can configure this requirement for all proofs created in the organization.

For more information about requiring login, see [Proof security in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/managing-security/proof-security-in-workfront-proof.md).

If you have your organization require reviewers to sign proofs electronically, which requires logging into [!DNL Workfront Proof], users can share proofs only with registered users. This is available on [!UICONTROL Enterprise] and [!UICONTROL Unlimited] edition plans. For more information, see [Understanding electronic signatures in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/managing-security/electronic-sigs-in-wp.md).

## Can I set a deadline for my reviewers?

### Answer

You can set a deadline for a new proof or a new proof version when you are creating the proof. You do this in the [!UICONTROL Workflow] section of the [!UICONTROL New Proof] page. If you use [!UICONTROL Automated Workflow], you can set a different deadline for each stage of your review.

You can also set or update a deadline for an existing proof using the [!UICONTROL Proof Details] page. For more information, see [Manage Proof Details in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md).

## How can I create a new version of my proof?

### Answer

Reviewers often request changes in their comments on a proof and would like to see a new version of the proof. You can create new versions of a proof. [!DNL Workfront Proof] remembers the proof's settings from the previous version. You can still edit these settings if you need to do something like adding or removing reviewers for the proof.

You must share each version with the specific reviewers who need to view it. For example, if you share only version 3 with a reviewer, that person can't see versions 1 and 2. Supervisors and Administrators in your account oversee all projects in the account, so they can see and edit all versions of the proof.

For more information, see .

## Can I share files using [!DNL Workfront Proof]?

### Answer

Yes. If you want to share something with other people, but you don't need them to view it as a proof (or if it's a file type that's not supported by [!DNL Workfront Proof]), you can upload it as a file to your [!DNL Workfront Proof] account. As with proofs, you can organize your files into folders, tag files, and add a custom message to the notification email when you share the file. For more information, see [Upload Files and Web Content to [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/upload-files-web-content.md).

When your recipients receive the email notification about a file you are sharing, they can download the file by clicking the link in the notification.

[!DNL Workfront Proof] users can convert files into proofs after saving them in their account.
