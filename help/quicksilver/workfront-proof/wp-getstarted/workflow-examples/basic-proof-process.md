# Basic Proofing Process in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

This example explains the basic workflow between a designer or project manager and one or more reviewers, such as a client.

* **Create new proof** - The designer or project manager creates a new proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof] and shares the proof with the client. (See [Generate Proofs in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md).)

* **New proof email** - The client receives an email containing a link to the proof.

* **Review a proof** - The client reviews the proof, adds comments and makes a decision. (See [Review proofs within [!DNL Adobe Workfront]](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md) and [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md).)

* **Email alert** - the designer or project manager receives an email with a summary of the client's review, depending on the email alerts they have set. (See [Configure email notification settings in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).)

* **New version** (if required) - The designer or project manager amends the file and uploads it to [!DNL Workfront Proof] as a new version. (See .)

You can repeat this process until the proof is approved.
