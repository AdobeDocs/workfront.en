# Working with Freelancers in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

If your organization works with freelancers, you can include them in your [!DNL Workfront Proof] process as well.

There are a few ways to do this depending on whether you want the freelancer to be part of your organization in [!DNL Workfront Proof] or not:

## Add Freelancers to Your [!DNL Workfront Proof] Account

You can simply add your freelancers as users to your account in [!DNL Workfront Proof], just like you would your colleagues, then they can be part of all of the workflows described in this section.

You can use the various user profiles, as well as folder privacy rule, to manage your Freelancer's visibility and access in your account.

See the articles  [User Profiles and Permissions](https://support.workfront.com/hc/https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004087428-User-profiles-and-permissions) and [Understand Folder Permissions in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/folder-permissions.md) before you add a freelancer as a user to your account.

For information about adding a freelancer to your team, see [Create Users using [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/users/create-users.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any freelancers added to your account as users will have visibility into your account and may also be able to see client details (depending on their user profile). This may not be what you want, so perhaps setting up a Satellite account for your freelancers would be a more suitable option; see [Set Up a Satellite Account for Your Freelancers](https://support.workfront.com/knowledge/articles/115004259868/en-us?brand_id=662728&return_to=%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F115004259868#Option-B---set-up-a-satellite-account-for-your-freelancers) below.

## Set Up a Satellite Account for Your Freelancers

If you don't want clients and freelancers to see each other in [!DNL Workfront Proof], you can set up satellite accounts for your freelancers.

This means that they will have their own dashboard to view all the items they are working on in one place. Further, they will be able to send files to you via [!DNL Workfront Proof], which you can convert to proofs ([!UICONTROL Enterprise] and [!UICONTROL Unlimited] plans only). For more information, see [Manage Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-files.md).

It also means that if the freelancer needs to create new versions of the proof during the review process, you can add them explicitly to the proof as an [!UICONTROL Author], which will allow them to participate in the review process and create new versions as and when required. For more information, see and [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).

1. The freelancer logs into their satellite account.
1. The freelancer uploads the file and shares it with you. See [Upload Files and Web Content to [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/upload-files-web-content.md) and [Share Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-files.md).

1. You receive an email telling you that a file has been shared with you.
1. You log in to your account and find the file that has been shared with you.
1. You use the [!UICONTROL convert to proof] button to convert the file to a proof. For more information, see [Manage Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-files.md).
1. You then manage the proof workflow with your clients in the normal way. If you want to add your Freelancer explicitly to the proof, you can do so using the share function. For more information, see [Share a Proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md).
1. If you don't want to add your Freelancer explicitly to the proof, but you do want to notify them when it's been approved; you can notify your freelancer at the end of the proof process by sharing a link to the proof with them.

   This means that they are not part of the review team and your clients don't see their name listed on the proof.

For information about setting up a satellite account for your freelancers, see  [Configure a satellite account in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/satellite-accounts/configure-sat-acct-in-wp.md).

## Use the [!UICONTROL Dropzone]

This option is useful if you don't want clients and freelancers to see each other in [!DNL Workfront Proof]. You can give your freelancers access to your [!UICONTROL Dropzone] (available on [!UICONTROL Enterprise] and [!UICONTROL Unlimited] plans only). For more information, see [The [!UICONTROL Dropzone]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/dropzone.md).

![freelancers_-_option_C_-_dropzone.png](assets/freelancers---option-c---dropzone-)

1. The freelancer goes to your public [!UICONTROL Dropzone] page.
1. They use the [!UICONTROL Dropzone] to create a new proof in your account.
1. You receive an email telling you that a new proof is in your [!UICONTROL Dropzone].
1. You login to your account and find the proof in your [!UICONTROL Dropzone].
1. You unlock the proof, add reviewers, set the proof settings and manage the proof workflow with your clients in the normal way. Your freelancer will be shown as the Creator of the proof (and will not be able to be removed).

* You can manage your freelancer's access to the proof with your [!UICONTROL Dropzone] settings. For more information, see [Configure the dropzone in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-dropzone-in-wp.md).
* You can also manage the role they are given on the proof, such as [!UICONTROL Read Only], as well as email communications with them in respect of the proof. For more information, see [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).
* If you do not want your freelancer to take part in the review process but you do want them to be notified of the final decision, you can set the default proof role within your [!UICONTROL Dropzone] settings and an email alert for all [!UICONTROL Dropzone] submitters to be [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md) and [Configure email notification settings in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md) respectively. For more information, see [Email Alerts,](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000911867-Email-alerts) [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md) and [Configure email notification settings in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).
* If you do want your freelancer to actively take part in the review process, you can adjust their proof role and email alert setting as required, by inline editing these details on the Proof details page. For more information about that page, see [Manage Proof Details in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md)
