# Internal Then External Review in [!DNL Workfront] Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

If your organization completes internal reviews before sharing proofs with clients, we suggest two ways you can use [!DNL Workfront Proof] to enhance your workflow:

## Clients See Internal Comments

This option illustrates a workflow where clients can see all internal comments.

The designer shares the proof with the Project Manager (and any other colleagues) first. Colleagues review the proof and, if they approve it, you can use the share function to share the proof with your clients. For more information, see [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md).

1. **[!UICONTROL Create a new proof]** -&nbsp;the designer creates a new proof in [!DNL Workfront] Proof and shares it will internal reviewers. The designer makes the project manager the owner&nbsp;of the proof.
1. **[!UICONTROL Internal review]** - the Project Manager and other colleagues review the proof.
1. **[!UICONTROL Share proof]** - the Project Manager shares the proof with the client.
1. **[!UICONTROL New proof email]** - the client receives the New proof email with the Go to proof link. For more information, see [New proof email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md).

1. **[!UICONTROL Review proof]** - the client reviews the proof, adds comments&nbsp;and makes a decision.
1. **[!UICONTROL Email alert]** - the Project Manager receives an email alert (depending on his settings on the proof). For more information, see [Configure email notification settings in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).

1. **[!UICONTROL Change request]** - the Project Manager lets the designer know about the change requests. This can be done using the print comments function. For more information, see [Print and Export Comments in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/print-and-export-comments.md).

1. **[!UICONTROL New Version]** (if required) - the designer amends the file and uploads it to [!DNL Workfront] Proof as a new version. For more information, see .

You can repeat this process until the proof is approved.

## Client Sees Only Their Own Version

This option illustrates a workflow where the proofing process is managed by the Project Manager who creates any new versions (as required) and shares the proof with the client. The designer does not need to be involved in the review process.)

![internal_external_-_option_B.png](assets/internal-external---option-b-350x86.png)

1. **Create a new proof** - The designer creates a new proof in [!DNL Workfront] Proof and shares it with internal reviewers. The designer makes the Project Manager the Owner&nbsp;of the proof, or alternatively gives him the role of Author&nbsp;on the proof (see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md)).

1. **Internal review** - the Project Manager and other colleagues review the proof. For more information, see [Reviewing Proofs in the Web Proofing Viewer](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000275214-Reviewing-Proofs-in-the-Web-Proofing-Viewer) and [Reviewing Proofs in the Desktop Proofing Viewer.](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000686434-Reviewing-Proofs-in-the-Desktop-Proofing-Viewer)

1. **New version** - the Project Manager creates a new version (or a copy) of the proof and shares it with the client. See [Copying Proofs in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/copy-proofs.md) and [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md).

1. **New proof email** - the client receives the New proof email with a Go to proof link.&nbsp;For more information, see [New proof email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md).

1. **[!UICONTROL Review proof]** - the client reviews the proof, adds comments and makes a decision.
1. The client can see only the version of the proof that has been explicitly shared with them; they will not be able to see the internal version.
1. **[!UICONTROL Email alert]** - the Project Manager receives an email with a summary of the client's review (depending on their settings on the proof).
1. **Change request** - the Project Manager lets the designer know about the change requests. This can be done using the print comments function.&nbsp;For more information, see [Print and Export Comments in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/print-and-export-comments.md).

1. **New version** (if required) - the designer amends the file and uploads it to [!DNL Workfront] Proof as a new version. For more information, see .

You can repeat this process until the proof is approved.
