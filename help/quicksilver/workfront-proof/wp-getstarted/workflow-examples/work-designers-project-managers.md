# Working with Designers and Project Managers in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]

>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can enhance the proofing workflow for the project manager (the person managing the reviewing process) and the designer who work together on a project in the two ways described below.

These workflows work well in any situation, but they are especially helpful if your designer creates files that might be too large to email to the project manager. 

## When the Designer Needs to See Comments and Decisions

When the designer needs to see comments and decisions made on a proof, he or she can begin the proofing process and receive the proof again when the process is complete. The designer can then begin the process again.

1. The designer creates a new proof and assigns the project manager as the owner of the project (for more information, see [Generate Proofs in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md)). As the creator of the proof, the designer can:

   * Comment on the proof and use the [!UICONTROL Actions] tab to keep track of comment threads.
   * Create a new version of the proof for the project manager.

1. The project manager reviews the proof and then shares it with the client. For more information, see [Share a Proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md).
1. The client receives an email containing a link to the proof. For more information, see [New proof email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md).
1. The client reviews the proof, adds comments, and makes a decision on the proof.
1. The project manager receives an email summarizing the client's review and the designer receives an email about the required changes. For more information, see [Configure email notification settings in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).
1. The designer or project manager amends the file; if the designer then uploads it as a new version, [!DNL Workfront Proof] reassigns the ownership of the proof to the project manager.

## When the Designer Doesn't Need to See Proof Comments and Decisions

When it is not necessary for the designer to be involved in the [!DNL Workfront Proof] review process, the project manager can create the proof and add the reviewers.

1. The designer uploads the file and shares it with the project manager. For more information, see [Upload Files and Web Content to [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/upload-files-web-content.md) and [Share Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-files.md).

1. The project manager receives the file and can create a proof from the file with just one click. For more information, see [Generate Proofs in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md) see also  [Manage Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-files.md) for information about converting files to proofs.

1. The client receives an email containing a link to the proof. For more information, see [New proof email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md).
1. The client reviews the proof, adds comments and makes a decision.
1. The project manager receives an email with a summary of the client's review and their decision. For more information, see [Configure email notification settings in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).
1. The project manager lets the designer know about the change requests using [!UICONTROL Print comments]. For more information, see [Print and Export Comments in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/print-and-export-comments.md).
1. If necessary, the designer amends the file and uploads it to [!DNL Workfront Proof], where the project manager can create a new version for another round of proofing.
