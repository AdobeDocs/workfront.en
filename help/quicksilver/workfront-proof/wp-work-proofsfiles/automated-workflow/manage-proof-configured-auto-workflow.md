The diagram of your Automated Workflow is displayed at the top of the Workflow section.

To hide the diagram

The stages on the diagram are marked as follows:

![dot.png](assets/dot.png)- an active stage

![grey_dot.png](assets/grey-dot.png)- an inactive stage  
![sbw-key-icon.png](assets/sbw-key-icon.png)&nbsp; - a private stage

![sbw-padlock-icon.png](assets/sbw-padlock-icon.png)&nbsp; - a locked stage

The lines between the stages depict the dependencies between the stages. The lines leading to inactive stages are dotted until the stage is activated.

Hovering over a stage in the diagram will show you the progress of the stage. If the stage is not active and you have edit rights on the stage, you will be able to start the stage from the pop up using the Start stage button. Similarly, the option to Lock an active stage will be displayed.
