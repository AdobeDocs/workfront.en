# Embed a Mini proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

The Miniproof is a widget that lets you embed a proof in a web page, blog, or wiki. The Miniproof shows the proof and all existing comments and mark-ups. You can use it to work on the proof as if you were in [!DNL Workfront Proof].

Here is an example of a Miniproof embedded in a Basecamp project:

* Name of the proof (1)
* Fullscreen (2) - it will open the proof in the Proof Viewer (outside of the environment the Miniproof was embedded in)
* Help links (3)
* Actions menu (4)
* View comments in sidebar (5)
