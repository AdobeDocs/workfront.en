# Share a Proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

If you have editing rights on a proof, you can easily share the proof with other reviewers. Anyone can be added to a proof, because you don't need to have a [!DNL Workfront Proof] account to review proofs.

For information about editing rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).

If you share a proof by adding reviewers:

* The people you share a proof with will appear in the [!UICONTROL Workflow] section of the Proof details page in their accounts. For more information about this page, seec[Manage Proof Details in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md).
* You will be able to set their role on the proof. For more information, see [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).
* You will be able to set their email alert. For more information, see [Configure email notification settings in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* When you add someone to a proof, you decide if you would like them to be notified of the proof or not. See [New proof email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md) for more information.
>* You can add anybody to a proof (as long as they have a valid email address). They do not need to have a [!DNL Workfront Proof] account!
>* Reviewers do not count towards your user limit. You can add as many people to a proof as you want for free.
