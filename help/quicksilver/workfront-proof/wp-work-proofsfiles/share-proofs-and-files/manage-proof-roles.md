# Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Proof roles enable you to grant permissions to users who are limited by the permission profile that is configured on their user profile. (For more information about permission profiles, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).)

Proof roles are different from account profiles. Your account profile relates to the overall permission level you have in your account and will affect the rights you have over all proofs in your account, even those which have not explicitly been shared with you.

For more information, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).

## About Proof Roles

The following proof roles are granted to users for an individual proof at the time the user is invited to review the proof:

* [Read Only](#read-only) 
* [Reviewer](#reviewer) 
* [Approver](#approver) 
* [Reviewer & Approver](#reviewer&approver) 
* [Author](#author) 
* [Moderator](#moderator)

The proof role defines what actions a reviewer can take in relation to that specific proof.

For example, if you are a Reviewer, you are being asked to review the proof by adding markups and comments. If you are a Reviewer & Approver, you are being asked to review and also make a decision on the proof.

Certain proof roles give a reviewer edit rights on the proof (even if their account profile doesn't) and lets them use some additional features like adding actions on comments, creating new versions, and adding more reviewers to the proof.

For more information, see the following articles:

* [Use actions on proof comments](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/use-actions-on-comments-in-viewer.md) 
* &nbsp;
* [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md)

This role allows the person to manage and moderate the proof comments, giving them the opportunity to keep only relevant comments on the proof and remove non-relevant comments.

>[!NOTE]

>&nbsp;This role can only be assigned to users of Workfront Proof.

## Assigning Proof Roles

You can assign proof roles when creating new proofs, creating new versions of existing proofs, or on existing proofs.

* [New Proofs](#new-proofs) 
* [New Versions](#new-versions) 
* [Existing Proofs](#existing-proofs)

### New Proofs

Proof roles can be assigned to reviewers on the New proof page during the proof creation process (1).

![Proof_roles_-_New_Proof_page.png](assets/proof-roles---new-proof-page-350x184.png)

### New Versions

When creating a New version of a proof, the reviewers from the previous version will automatically be shown (with the same role as the previous version).

You can edit the proof roles applied to reviewers when creating the new version (1).

![Proof_roles_-_New_Version_page.png](assets/proof-roles---new-version-page-350x164.png)

### Existing Proofs

If you want to change a person's role on an existing proof, you can do so on the Proof details page by inline editing their role in the workflow section (1):

![Proof_Roles_-_Proof_Details_page_2.png](assets/proof-roles---proof-details-page-2-350x131.png)

## Checking roles in the Proof Viewer

You can check the role of a reviewer directly from the Proof Viewer (1) and edit it (2) if necessary.

![Proof_roles_-_Proof_Viewer.png](assets/proof-roles---proof-viewer-350x300.png)

##  Default Proof Roles

You can set your default proof role on the Proofing Defaults page in your Personal settings. This means that when you are added to a proof, your default proof role will be populated automatically. Please note that this role can be changed at the proof level by a user with edit rights on a proof.

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;Only users with Administrator or Billing Administrator profiles can change the proofing defaults for other users in their account.

For more information, see [Personal settings in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-getstarted/personal-settings/personal-settings.md).

## Creators and Owners

Creators and Owners have full edit rights on the proof.

* [Creators](#creators) 
* [Owners](#owners)

### Creators

The proof creator is the person who uploads the proof in the first instance. The proof creator will be shown automatically in the people list for the proof (in their default role).

On the New proof page&nbsp;you can assign a different proof role to the proof creator (other than their default role).

The proof creator cannot be changed or removed from a proof.

### Owners

By default, the Creator is also the Owner of the proof; however, the Creator can make someone else the proof Owner when initially creating the proof (on the New proof page).

To change the Owner on the New proof page:

1. Click on the change link displayed next to the Creator's name.
1. Select the new Owner from the drop-down menu. (2)

![Proof_roles_-_new_proof_page_change_owner_2.png](assets/proof-roles---new-proof-page-change-owner-2-350x185.png)

Once the proof has been created, it's still possible to change the owner. Anyone with edit rights on the proof will be able to change the proof ownership to another user via the Proof details page (see below).

The ability to change the Owner of a proof is particularly useful from a workflow management point of view. It allows the person responsible for the project to take over the ownership of proofs, giving them edit rights on the proofs and the ability to view them in the My proofs view.

To change the Owner of the proof via the Proof details page:

* Click on the Actions menu next to the name of the person you would like to make the Owner&nbsp;
* Select Make owner from the drop-down menu.&nbsp;
* Alternatively, you can click into the Owner field next to the proof image and choose the new Owner from the drop-down displayed.

Once this is done, the word "Owner" will be displayed next to that person's name.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only a user from the same account or a partner account can be made the owner&nbsp;of a proof. A user in a partner account can be made the owner of a proof only when:
>
>* There is an existing partner relationship set up between the accounts. For more information, see [Partner accounts in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/partner-accounts/partner-accounts.md).
>* There are no custom fields on the new proof page.
>* The proof has not been assigned to a folder.
>* No tags have been applied to the proof.
>

To temporarily delegate proof ownership within Workfront Proof, see [Designating Temporary Proof Owners in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-getstarted/personal-settings/designate-temp-proof-owners.md).
