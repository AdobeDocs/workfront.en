# Access a proof shared with you

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

When you receive an email about a proof, it contains a personal URL to access the proof. For more information, see [New proof email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md).&nbsp;

``` ```**Warning: **`````` The URL from the email is personal to you and will open the proof with you already identified as the reviewer. It is important that you do not forward the URL to anyone else; if you do, any comments or decisions that they make will be in your name. If you would like someone else to view the proof and you have the proof permission to do so, use the proof sharing functionality explained in [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md). For information about proof permissions, see&nbsp; [Share a document in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/document-permissions.md), or, if you are using Workfront Proof, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).

Alternatively, if proof sharing is enabled on the proof, you can let someone else view the proof by sharing the Proof URL from the proofing viewer or from&nbsp;the Share this proof with someone else link in your New proof email).
Consider the following about shared proofs:

* Anyone with a valid email address can be added to a proof. They do not need to be a Workfront Proof user with login credentials.
* Any proof that has been shared with you will appear in the Views page of your account. For more information, see [Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-items-on-views-page.md)
* When someone shares a proof URL with you, you can access the proof as described in [Share the Public URL in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-public-url.md)
* You can search for any proof that has been shared with you based on the following criteria:

  * Proof name
  * Description (message associated with a proof)
  * Tag name (see [Create and Manage Tags in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/create-and-manage-tags.md))

To open a proof from an email you have received:

1. Click&nbsp;**Go to proof**&nbsp;in the email.

   The proof opens in the proofing viewer, ready for review. For information about reviewing the proof, see [Review a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/review-a-proof.md).
