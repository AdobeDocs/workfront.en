# Create a Mini proof in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

The Miniproof is a widget that lets you embed a proof in a web page, blog, or wiki.

The Miniproof shows the proof and all existing comments&nbsp;and mark-ups. You can work on the proof as if you were in Workfront Proof.

Here is an example of a Miniproof embedded in a Basecamp project:&nbsp;

* Name of the proof (1)
* Fullscreen (2): Opens the proof in the Proof Viewer (outside of the environment where the Miniproof was embedded)
* Help links (3)
* Actions menu (4)
* View comments in sidebar (5)
