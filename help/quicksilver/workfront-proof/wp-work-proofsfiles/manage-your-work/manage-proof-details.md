The [!UICONTROL Proof details] page lets you manage an existing proof. For example, you can add new reviewers, amend the deadline, change the settings you originally set for the proof, and check what activity has occurred on that proof.

The [!UICONTROL Proof details] page is particularly useful for people in charge of projects, who need to keep track of all changes on a proof. On this page, they can find everything they need to know about a proof in just a few clicks.

To find out how to manage Automated Workflow proofs, see [Manage a proof configured with an Automated Workflow in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/automated-workflow/manage-proof-configured-auto-workflow.md).
