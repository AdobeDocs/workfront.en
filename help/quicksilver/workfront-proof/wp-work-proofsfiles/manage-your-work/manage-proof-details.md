>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

The Proof details page lets you manage an existing proof. For example, you can add new reviewers, amend the deadline, change the settings you originally set for the proof, and check what activity has occurred on that proof.

The Proof details page is particularly useful for people in charge of projects, who need to keep track of all changes on a proof. On this page, they can find everything they need to know about a proof in just a few clicks.

To find out how to manage Automated Workflow proofs, see [Manage a proof configured with an Automated Workflow in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/automated-workflow/manage-proof-configured-auto-workflow.md).

## Opening the Proof Details Page from a Views List

1. Click the **More**&nbsp;(three dot) menu to the right of the proof, then click **View proof details**.

## Opening the Proof Details Page from the proofing viewer

1. if the left toolbar is not showing, click the&nbsp;**Menu**&nbsp;icon, located in the upper-left corner.
