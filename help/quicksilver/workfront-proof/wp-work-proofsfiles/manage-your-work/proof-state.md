# Understand Proof State in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

In Workfront Proof, proofs exist in different states. These states determine what actions you can take on the proof, such as commenting or making decisions.

## Understanding Proof State

The four states are as follows:

* [Active](#active) 
* [Locked](#locked) 
* [Draft (Dropzone only)](#draft-dropzone-only) 
* [Submitted (Dropzone only)](#submitted-dropzone-only)

### Active {#active}

Proofs that are uploaded to Workfront Proof through the New Proof page&nbsp;or the Dropzone appear as&nbsp;Active****after they are processed. When a proof is active users can review, make comments, and make decisions on the proof.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Proofs that are uploaded through the Dropzone appear as&nbsp;Active only&nbsp;if the&nbsp;Activate proof on submission****option is enabled. If the option is not enabled, you must manually activate the proof.

For more information about Dropzone settings, see [Configure the dropzone in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-dropzone-in-wp.md).

### Locked {#locked}

You can lock a proof when you finish reviewing it. Locking a proof means no more comments or decisions can be made on the proof, but the proof can still be opened.&nbsp;

Any users with Edit rights on the proof can unlock it.&nbsp;

For more information about rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Email notifications no longer send when a proof is locked. For example, if a proof is locked before its deadline, a notification email is not sent when the deadline is reached.

### Draft (Dropzone only) {#draft-dropzone-only}

When you submit a proof through the Dropzone, it goes into the&nbsp;Draft****state before the admin activates it. When it is in the draft zone, you cannot take any actions on the proof.&nbsp;

### Submitted (Dropzone only) {#submitted-dropzone-only}

After a draft is activated by the admin, your proof shows as&nbsp;Submitted****in the Dropzone. After it is submitted, you can take actions on the proof.

## Viewing and Changing Proof State

For information about viewing a list of all proofs in a specific state, such as&nbsp;viewing all&nbsp;Active****or&nbsp;Locked proofs, see [Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-items-on-views-page.md) in the article [Manage Items on the Views Page in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-items-on-views-page.md).
