# Delete a Proof in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Users who have edit rights on a proof can delete it.

For more information on edit rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md) and [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md)

When you delete a proof (or any other item, such as a file or folder) in your account, [!DNL Workfront Proof] moves it to the Trash. Items in the Trash can be restored easily.

For information about the Trash, see [Restore and Empty the Trash in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/restore-and-empty-trash.md).

>[!NOTE]

>Items stored in the Trash count towards your storage limit. To free up storage space, please empty the Trash.
