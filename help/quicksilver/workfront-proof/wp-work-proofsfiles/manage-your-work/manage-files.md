# Manage Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can manage, share, and view information about the files (not proofs) uploaded to Workfront Proof (see [Upload Files and Web Content to [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/upload-files-web-content.md)).

1. Click the down arrow to the right of **[!UICONTROL Views]** in the left navigation panel, then click **[!UICONTROL Files]** in the drop-down menu.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** button for the file, then click **[!UICONTROL View file details]** in the menu that appears.\

   You can view and edit details about the file in the window that appears. For example, you can change the filename at the top of the window, the [!DNL Workfront Proof] **Folder** that stores file, and the **Owner** of the file.\

* **[!UICONTROL Trash]**. You can delete the file by moving it to the Trash. Please note that the file will count towards your storage limit until the Trash is emptied (see [Restore and Empty the Trash in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/restore-and-empty-trash.md)).\

* **[!UICONTROL More]**. In this dropdown list, you can click **[!UICONTROL Convert to proof]** to create a proof for a file (see [Generate Proofs in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md)). The file must meet our file types requirements for proofs (see [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md)). If the name of the file matches the name of an existing proof, [!DNL Workfront Proof] will display a message with a link allowing you to convert the file to a **[!UICONTROL New version]** of that proof (see ).\

   >For files which were shared from another [!DNL Workfront Proof] account (and not uploaded to your own account), converting is available only on Enterprise Plans.
