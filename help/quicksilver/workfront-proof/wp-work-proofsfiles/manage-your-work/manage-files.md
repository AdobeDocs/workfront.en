# Manage Files in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can manage, share, and view information about the files (not proofs) uploaded to Workfront Proof (see [Upload Files and Web Content to Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/upload-files-web-content.md)).

1. Click the down arrow to the right of&nbsp;**Views**in the left navigation panel, then&nbsp;click **Files**in the drop-down menu.

1. Click the **More**&nbsp;button for the file, then click **View file details** in the menu that appears.

   You can view and edit details about the file in the window that appears. For example, you can change the filename at the top of the window, the Workfront Proof **Folder** that stores file, and the **Owner** of the file.

1. (Optional) If you have edit rights for the file, use the action buttons in the upper-right corner to manage and share the file:

* **Tags**. Manage****tags&nbsp;applied to the file.  
  ![](assets/tags-button.png)  
  Beneath the action buttons, you can view any tags applied to the file. You can remove an unwanted tag by clicking the x next to it.

* **Move to**. Organize your files into folders. You can move a file between existing folders or place them in a new folder.

* **Share**. Share&nbsp;files with other people. Workfront Proof sends an email notification including a custom message and download links to the recipients.

* **Trash**. You can delete the file by moving it to the Trash. Please note that the file will count towards your storage limit until the Trash is emptied (see [Restore and Empty the Trash in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/restore-and-empty-trash.md)).  
  ![](assets/trash-button.png)

* **More**. In this dropdown list, you can click&nbsp;**Convert to proof** to create a proof for a file (see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md)).&nbsp;The file must meet our file types requirements for proofs (see [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md)). If the name of the file matches the name of an existing proof, Workfront Proof will display a message with a link allowing you to convert the file to a **New version**of that proof (see ).

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >For files which were shared from another Workfront Proof account (and not uploaded to your own account), converting is available only on Enterprise Plans.

  You can click also click&nbsp;**Download** to download the original file to your computer.

1. (Optional) Open the **Shared with** section to list the users the file has been shared with.  
   
   You can **Message** or **Remove** a user using the **More** icon on the right.  
   
   ![](assets/message-and-remove.png)  
   
   If you choose to Message one of these users, the **Message all** page appears, where you can send multiple messages at once.

1. Open the **Activity** section to list all activity on the file, including the time, date and person who performed the action. Activity includes:

   *   File uploaded
   *   New people added
   *   People removed
   *   File downloaded

1. Open the **Messages** section to trace messages users have sent in association with the file. You can view the content of a message by clicking the "i" icon to the right.
