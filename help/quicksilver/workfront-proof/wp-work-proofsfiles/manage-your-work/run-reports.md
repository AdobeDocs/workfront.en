Workfront Proof enables you to view reports so you can track the work progress and efficiencies of your teams.

You can easily view the number of proofs that were created in your [!DNL Workfront Proof] account, how many versions are associated with each proof, the turnaround time, and more.

## Prerequisites

Whether reports are available depends on your type of [!DNL Workfront Proof] account and user permission levels.

* [Account Prerequisites](#account-prerequisites)
* [User Prerequisites](#user-prerequisites)

### Account Prerequisites {#account-prerequisites}

Reporting information is available only with Premium plans.

### User Prerequisites {#user-prerequisites}

Reporting information is available only to users with full access to all proofs on your account (i.e. users with at least [Proof Permissions Profiles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md)).

In this panel you can

* Control the time span of the displayed data
* Analyze changes in metrics over time
* Check the details of a selected point in time by hovering over it
* Check the total number of proofs created in your selected time span
* Check the average number of versions included in the completed sets of proofs
