# Share Folders in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can share a folder with users and whole companies that have [!DNL Workfront Proof] accounts (not with guests).

If you share a whole folder:

* You cannot set roles for the people you are sharing the folder with (roles and email alerts will only apply to recipients when sharing individual proofs).
* The recipients will have read-only access to all the items in the folder (existing and subsequently added items).
* The recipients will get one email containing a personal URL to the folder.
* The recipients will not get email notifications when new items are added to the folder.
* The recipients will be able to download the original files for items in the folder (please note that each proof must have the [!UICONTROL Download original file] option enabled in order for recipient to be able to download the original file).
* Owners and creators of folders are always able to view the folder and cannot be removed from the folder.
* If you share a private folder with a Manager user in your account, you can decide if you would like them to have edit rights on the folder.

You can also share items within a folder (rather than the folder itself). For more information, see [Share a Proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md) and [Share Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-files.md).

## Accessing a Folder That's Been Shared With You

When someone shares a folder with you, it appears in the sidebar of their [!DNL Workfront Proof] account under the name of the owner of the folder. You receive an email containing folder details and a personal link to the folder.

1. Click the link in the notification email you receive.
1. Log in to [!DNL Workfront Proof].\
  [!DNL  Workfront Proof] displays the Folder details page. For more information, see [Manage Folders and their Contents in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/manage-folders-and-contents.md).

## About Sharing Sub Folders

If a parent folder which contains subfolders is shared and subsequently a subfolder is moved out from under the parent folder (for example, to top level), the original share will not be maintained on the subfolder. This is because the subfolder itself was not explicitly shared, the parent folder was. Therefore, in this case, if you would like the subfolder to be shared with the original recipients you should share the subfolder again with those recipients.

If a private parent folder is shared with a Manager and edit rights on the folder are given to this user, this setting is inherited by all subfolders in the private folder.

## About Sub Folders That Are Shared with You

When a sub-folder has been shared with someone, it appears in the sidebar of your [!DNL Workfront Proof] account under the name of the owner of the folder.

If the parent folder, or items from it, have already been shared with the same person, the sub-folder will automatically appear under the parent folder in the sidebar and within the parent folder's details page.

## About Sharing a Folder with a Company

To share a folder with a partner organization, there must be an existing partner relationship set up between your account and theirs.

Sharing a folder with a partner means:

* All users in that organization will have Read Only access to the folder (and folder items).
* Any new users added to the organization will automatically have Read Only access to the folder (and all items in the folder).

See [Share items with a partner in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/partner-accounts/share-items-partner-in-wp.md) for more information.
