# Manage Folders and their Contents in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

One of the benefits of organizing your projects and proofs into folders is the ability to manage them on the [!UICONTROL Folder details] page. This page is a control center for your project, from here you can conveniently manage individual proofs and files as well as perform bulk actions.

## Grouping Items So Reviewers Can Work On Them Together

You can use folders to group proofs that you want reviewers to work on together. When a reviewer opens one of the proofs in the folder to launch the proofing viewer, all the other proofs in the folder are available—the reviewer can work on any proof in the folder without leaving the proofing viewer. For more information, see [Work with multiple proofs in the proofing viewer](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/work-with-multiple-proofs.md).

## Adding New Items to a Folder

When you are creating a proof or uploading a file, you can select the folder where you want to store it in the [!UICONTROL Organize] section on the [!UICONTROL New proof] page or the [!UICONTROL New file] page.

For more information, see [Generate Proofs in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md) or [Upload Files and Web Content to [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/upload-files-web-content.md).

>[!NOTE]
