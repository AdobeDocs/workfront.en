>The information in this article refers to functionality that is currently deprecated and will be removed from Adobe Workfront in 2018.

## Using Zoom

You can zoom by clicking on the proof image and also by clicking and dragging to highlight a certain area of the proof to zoom in to. If you choose the latter method, the smaller the area highlighted the more it will zoom in.

When you open a proof

* The proof will open at 100% if this fits in the proof viewer
* Otherwise the proof will zoom until it fits the proof viewer but no further than 50%

When viewing comments

* The image will not zoom in automatically
* If the markup fits in the current zoom level, it won't zoom out
* If the markup fits in the current zoom level but is not in view, the proof image will pan to show the markup

## Using the Sidebar

In the sidebar inside you'll find many useful options and settings, including the proof details, grouped into a few sections:

* Dashboard (1) - The Dashboard icon takes you directly to the Dashboard on your account. This icon is visible for Workfront Proof users only.
* Folder browser (2 )The folder icon&nbsp;is visible to all reviewers one the proof, but only if the proof is placed in a&nbsp;folder.
* If you don't have permissions to access the latest version of a particular proof from this folder, you won't see this proof listed in this view even though one of the previous versions has been shared with you.

* Create new items (3)&nbsp;
* Workflow (4)
* Details (5)
* Share (6)
* Email notifications (7)
* More (8)
* Settings (9)
* Help (10)

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;Some buttons&nbsp;in the sidebar are only visible to Workfront Proof users, as per their permissions on the proof.
