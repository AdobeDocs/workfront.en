# Review a proof simultaneously with multiple reviewers

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Multiple reviewers can review a proof at the same time. When you are reviewing a proof, you can see who else is currently reviewing the same proof.

You can see presence indicators when other reviewers have the same proof open, whether or not they add comments to the proof. If they do add comments, the comments appear while you are reviewing the proof; you don't have to refresh the proofing viewer to see them.

1. View the presence indicators in the upper-right corner of the proofing viewer.

   If you are using [!DNL Workfront Proof] (not the proofing functionality integrated with [!DNL Workfront]), presence indicators contain the user's [!DNL Workfront Proof] profile picture or, if there is no profile picture, the first and last initial if the user.

   Profile pictures in [!DNL Workfront] do not appear in the proofing viewer.

1. (Optional) Mouse over a presence indicator to view the name of the user.
