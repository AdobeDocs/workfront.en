# Copying Proofs in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Reviewers with edit rights on a proof can create a copy of the proof, either as a new version of the existing proof or as a new proof. (For more information, see . For information about edit rights, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).)

The reviewers that were on the original proof automatically appear in the [!UICONTROL Share] section of the [!UICONTROL Copy proof] page, but they can be removed. If a reviewer is deleted, their comments will remain.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A copy of a proof counts towards your monthly proof limit. However, if the copy is created as a new version, it is included in the version set count. For more information, see [Managing Proof Versions in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-versions.md).

1. Go to any of the **[!UICONTROL Views]** pages, as described in [Manage Items on the Views Page in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-items-on-views-page.md).
