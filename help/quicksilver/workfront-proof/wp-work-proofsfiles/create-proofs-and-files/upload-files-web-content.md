# Upload Files and Web Content to [!DNL Workfront] Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can upload files to [!DNL Workfront] Proof without creating a proof. You can also add URLs for websites and other web content to [!DNL Workfront] Proof.

## About Uploading a File Without Creating a Proof

In some cases, you may want to add a file to [!DNL Workfront] Proof and create a proof for it simultaneously (see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md)).

In other cases, you may want to add a file to [!DNL Workfront] Proof without creating a proof.

This is useful, for example, if you do not have proofing rights but you need to provide a file for review to users who do have proofing rights; one of those users can create the proof after you have uploaded it.

Also, you can use [!DNL Workfront] Proof as cloud storage for files without creating proofs for them. Some organizations use [!DNL Workfront Proof] to keep all digital materials for a project together, even when some of them, such as internal documents about the project, do not need to be proofed.

## Uploading Files and Adding URLs

To upload a file to [!DNL Workfront] Proof:

1. In the upper-left corner of [!DNL Workfront Proof], click the down arrow on the **New proof** button, then click **[!UICONTROL Upload file]** in the menu that appears.\

1. The **[!DNL New File]** page appears.
1. Do one of the following to upload or add the content you need to proof:

   * Drag and drop the file or files into the **[!UICONTROL Drop files here]** box. Or&nbsp;click **[!UICONTROL Select files]**, then find and&nbsp;select them.

   * You can repeat this step to add as many files as you want. The files you upload will appear as individual files in your account, rather than one merged file.

   * If you are creating a file from a URL, type the URL in the box containing&nbsp;**www.yoursite.com**. When you are finished,&nbsp;press **Enter** or click the green arrow button at the end of the box.\

      You can create multiple files all at once by typing multiple URLs separated by spaces.

1. Type the email address of the reviewers who need to proof the files in the box below **Share**.\
   When you complete these steps, these recipients will receive an email containing the download links for the files.\
   You can share the files with contacts, groups, and partners (see [Contacts,](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000920808-Contacts)&nbsp; [Groups,](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000920828-Groups)&nbsp;and [Partner Accounts](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000912107-Partner-accounts)).&nbsp;

1. (Optional) You can select **[!UICONTROL Notify people by email]** if you want to add a custom subject and message to the email received by the recipients of the files.&nbsp;See [Share Files in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-files.md)&nbsp;for more information.

1. (Optional) Under **[!UICONTROL Organize]**, you can select or create a folder to organize the files you are uploading.&nbsp;You can also add tags to easily identify and find the files.
1. Tags are simply words&nbsp;or combinations of words that you can use to describe the content of a file. They make it easier to search for what you need.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >&nbsp;Folders you add in [!DNL Workfront] Proof are part of the proofing system only; they are not part of the file folder system you access on your computer or on your company's servers.&nbsp;

1. Click **Save**.&nbsp;
