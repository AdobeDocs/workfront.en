When you are creating a new proof or a new version of a proof, adding new people to a proof, or adding a workflow to a proof, you can decide if you want to email the reviewers, as explained in these articles:

* [Create an advanced proof with an Automated workflow](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-automated-proof-workflow.md) 
* [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md)

The email your recipients receive is called the New Proof email. Only the proof creator and users authorized to add reviewers to a proof can control this email. Recipients cannot disable it.

The New proof email contains:

* Your personal message (if you choose to include one)  
* If you always send the same custom message to your reviewers, it might be a good idea to save it in your Personal settings under the Proofing defaults tab. For more information, see .
* Personal link to the proof
* **View details** link that takes you to the associated Workfront object (such as a project, task, or issue)
* Thumbnail of the proof image
* The following proof details:

   * Proof name
   * Version number

     For more information, see .
   
   * List of the reviewers and their progress on the proof
   * A link to share the proof with someone else

     This allows you to share the proof URL and/or the download link for the original file. This does not allow you to explicitly add reviewers to the proof, you will only be sharing the public proof URL, and the recipient will receive read only access to the proof.

     See [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md) for more information.

     If you don't want this link to appear on your recipient's email, you can disable the Public Sharing settings on the proof

     (Download original file and Public URL). See [Manage Proof Details in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md) for more information.

## The Activity Log

Sending a New Proof email to a reviewer is logged in the Activity section of Proof details page. See&nbsp; [Manage Proof Details in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md)&nbsp;for more information. You can check if the New Proof email was enabled at the time of creating a proof.

>* If the Creator or Owner of the proof has Proof Made emails disabled by default (in their personal settings), they won't receive any Proof made or New proof emails even if the Notify people by email box is checked on the New proof page. For more information, see .
>* If the email notifications are disabled as a default in the Account settings&nbsp;the Creator / Owner of the proof won't receive any Proof made or New proof emails even if this is enabled in their personal settings and the Notify people by email box is checked on the New proof page.&nbsp;For more information, [The Proof Made email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/proof-made-email.md) and see .

## Enable the New Proof email and include a custom message

You can specify whether you want to send an email alert to the reviewers on a proof when you create it or when you add someone to it.

* [When you create a proof](#when-you-create-a-proof) 
* [When you add a reviewer to a proof](#when-you-add-a-reviewer-to-a-proof)

### When you create a proof {#when-you-create-a-proof}

When you are creating a new proof in the New proof page, under the **Share** section, you can select whether to send email alerts:

* Here you can decide if you want to Notify people by email (1). If you deselect this option, none of your reviewers receive an email to let them know that the proof is ready for their review.
* You can also include a Custom message in the email notification (2).
* If you decide to add your own custom message you will be able to put in a customized subject line (3) and a message in the body of the email (4).
* To discard the custom message simply click on the link (5).

### When you add a reviewer to a proof {#when-you-add-a-reviewer-to-a-proof}

You can select if a new reviewer added to an existing proof will be notified of the proof (similar to above).

* First, add new reviewers by clicking the **Share this Version** button on the **Proof details** page (1).

![Proof_Details_page_1.png](assets/proof-details-page-1-350x118.png)

* A box appears in which you can add new reviewers. You can then decide if you want them to be notified by email (2) and choose to add a custom message to the email (3).

![Proof_Details_page_2.png](assets/proof-details-page-2-350x174.png)

* If you choose to add a custom message, the box expands and you will be able to put in a custom subject line (4) and custom text in the body of the email (5). You can also discard the custom message by clicking on the link (6).
