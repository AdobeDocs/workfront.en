New version emails are sent when you create a New version of a proof. You can customize and disable them the same way as the New proof emails.

>[!NOTE]

>If the email notifications are disabled as a default in the Account settings, reviewers won't receive any New version emails unless the Notify people by email box is checked on the New version page.
