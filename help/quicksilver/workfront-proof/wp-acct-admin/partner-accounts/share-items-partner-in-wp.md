# Share items with a partner in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

If you have a [!DNL Workfront Proof] partner relationship with another organization (such as a client or another department in your company), you can share proofs, files, folders, and contact details with the partner. For more information about partner relationships, see [Manage a partner relationship between Workfront Proof accounts](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/partner-accounts/manage-partner-relationship-between-wp-accts.md).

## About Sharing Items with a Partner

Consider the following when sharing items with a partner:

* You can choose a user in a partner account to be the owner of a proof only if it is new proof you are creating. You cannot do so for existing proof or a new version of a proof.
* When you share at item with a partner, you pass the editing rights for the proof to the Supervisors and Administrators in the partner account. Supervisors and Administrators in the account in which the proof was created no longer have edit rights on the proof (this includes the proof creator). For more information about permissions in [!DNL Workfront] Proof, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).
* The proof is stored in the account where the proof is owned (not the account where it was created).
* The proof branding is taken from the account where the proof is owned (not the account where the proof was created).

## Sharing Items with a Partner

After you have an accepted relationship with a partner, you can easily share items, such as folders, files, and proofs with them.

1. Begin sharing a proof or file.\
   For more information about sharing, see [Share a Proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md)  [Share Files in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-files.md) and [Share Folders in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/share-folders.md).

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Share]** section of the [!UICONTROL New Proof] or [!UICONTROL New File] page, the name of your partner appears as you begin typing the name in the auto-complete field, just as if you are sharing with another user in the system.\
