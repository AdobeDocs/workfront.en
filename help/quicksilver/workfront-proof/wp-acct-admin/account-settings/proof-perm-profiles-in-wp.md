# Proof Permissions Profiles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

As a [!DNL Workfront] administrator or [!DNL Workfront Proof] administrator, you can assign a Proof Permissions Profile to a user to specify the proofing capabilities that user will have for all proofs in the system. For information about configuring a user's Proof Permission Profile, see [Configure a user's Proof Permission Profile in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/config-user-pref-in-wp.md).

>[!NOTE]

>You can also do the following:
>
>* Grant users specific roles on individual proofs. For more information about proof roles, see [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).
>* Create custom profiles for users in your organization. For more information, see [Configure custom profiles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-custom-profiles.md).

The following table displays the permissions available with each Proof Permissions Profile.

| **Own Items** |||||**Other Users' Items** |||**Admin** |**Billing** |

Consider the following about roles and permissions:

* Assigned profile permissions relate only to the users and items in your own account. The exception is in the case of Satellite accounts, where the Administrator and Billing Administrator for the main (hub) accounts can access and manage the account settings and billing of those accounts from the hub account level.
* Billing Administrators and Administrators can delete users. This can only be done in Account settings.
* When Billing Administrators and Administrators view proofs that are owned by other users in their account, they view them with the role of a Reviewer.
* Using the Read Only role, Billing Administrators and Administrators can access proofs in folders shared with them or in folders created by them.

The following sections describe each profile and the permissions associated with the profile in a standard [!DNL Workfront Proof] setup:

* [Billing Administrator](#billing-administrator) 
* [Administrator](#administrator) 
* [Supervisor](#supervisor) 
* [Manager](#manager) 
* [Observer](#observer) 
* [Visitor](#visitor) 
* [Guest](#guest)
