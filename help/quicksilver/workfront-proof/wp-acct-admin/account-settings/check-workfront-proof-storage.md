# Check your Workfront Proof storage

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Your account plan comes with a fixed amount of storage. Plan storage does not renew with each subscription because&nbsp;proofs and files from previous subscriptions are still saved on your account.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Your organization's Workfront Proof storage is separate from your Workfront storage.

## Checking Your Storage Amount

1. Click **Settings** > **Account settings**.

1. Open the **History** tab.
1. View your current storage mount under **Usage stats**.  
   The Billing Administrators of your account will receive a warning email if the storage usage on your account&nbsp;reaches 75%.

## Getting More Storage

You can free up some storage by deleting old proofs and files from your account. Please note that items in the&nbsp;Trash&nbsp;folder (and archived proofs) count towards your Storage.&nbsp;

If you want to upgrade your account to increase your storage limit, please contact our Sales team.
