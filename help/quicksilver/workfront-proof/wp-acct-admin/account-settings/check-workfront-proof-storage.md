# Check your [!DNL Workfront Proof] storage

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Your account plan comes with a fixed amount of storage. Plan storage does not renew with each subscription because proofs and files from previous subscriptions are still saved on your account.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Your organization's [!DNL Workfront Proof] storage is separate from your [!DNL Workfront] storage.

## Checking Your Storage Amount

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Account settings]**.

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL History]** tab.
1. View your current storage mount under **[!UICONTROL Usage stats]**.
   The Billing Administrators of your account will receive a warning email if the storage usage on your account reaches 75%.

## Getting More Storage

You can free up some storage by deleting old proofs and files from your account. Please note that items in the [!UICONTROL Trash] folder (and archived proofs) count towards your Storage. 

If you want to upgrade your account to increase your storage limit, please contact our Sales team.
