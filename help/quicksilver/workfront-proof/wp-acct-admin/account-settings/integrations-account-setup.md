>[!IMPORTANT]

>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

As a Workfront Proof administrator, you can configure Workfront Proof to integrate with Basecamp, Basecamp Classic, [!DNL NetSuite], and Workfront.

After you establish the&nbsp;general connections for integration, each user can set up&nbsp;their own personal connections via the [!UICONTROL Integrations] tab available on the Personal Settings page.

See the&nbsp; [Integrations articles](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000588707-Integrations) for details and instructions.
