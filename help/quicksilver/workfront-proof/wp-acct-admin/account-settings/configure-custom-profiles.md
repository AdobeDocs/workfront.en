# Configure custom profiles in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

As a Workfront Proof Billing Administrator or Workfront Proof Administrator, you can configure custom profiles for other users.

Custom profiles allow you to assign granular permissions to users in your account and define the level of access and rights they have over the items in your account. For more information about custom profiles, see [Create and Manage Custom Profiles using Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/users/create-and-manage-custom-profiles.md).

You can adjust the layout of the page to view only the information relevant to you:

* You can adjust the number of items displayed (1)
* You can filter the list of profiles to locate the ones you want to work with (2)
* You can easily check the number of profiles you have in the account (3)
