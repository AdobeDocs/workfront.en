# Satellite accounts in [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Satellite accounts are paid accounts that you set up and manage from within your own [!DNL Workfront Proof] account.

Your account becomes a "[!UICONTROL Hub]," which is used to manage the Satellite account(s) linked to it.

There is no limit to the number of Satellite accounts you can set up, so you could create a separate account for each of your clients if you wanted.

You can add multiple users from an organization to the Satellite account and create a personalized, branded account for them to work in. 

## Why should I set up a Satellite account?

At [!DNL Workfront], we often get asked these questions:

* Can I create a login for each of my clients?
* How can clients login without seeing private data?
* Should I add a freelancer to my [!DNL Workfront Proof] account?

[!UICONTROL Workfront Proof] allows you to easily share proofs with anyone who has a valid email address - they don't even need their own login to [!UICONTROL Workfront Proof].

However, there may be times when you do want the participants in your workflow to have their own login so that they have their own dashboard and can see all the proofs that you have shared with them all within one place.

You may also want to increase security on your proofs by using the [!UICONTROL Login Required] setting, in which case your reviewers will need to have their own login. For more information, see [Proof security in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/managing-security/proof-security-in-workfront-proof.md).

We strongly advise you against adding external people as users in your [!DNL Workfront Proof] account, as this could give them access to information that you do not want them to see.

So, how do you set up logins for people in other organizations?

By creating Satellite accounts for your clients.
