## Linking existing separate accounts to your hub account

If you previously created other separate accounts for your clients, these can be converted to Satellite accounts.

We will take care of this for you by linking them to your Workfront Proof account (making it a hub account).

All you need to do is provide us with the following details:

* The name of your Workfront Proof account and the email address you used to set it up
* The names of the separate accounts you want linked to your account and the email addresses used to set up the separate accounts.
