>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Download the [!DNL Workfront Proof] app from the Apple App Store or Google Store to be productive wherever you are. The [!DNL Workfront Proof] app has the following features on the iPhone and iPod Touch:

You do not need to be a user of [!DNL Workfront Proof] (i.e., have your own login credentials) to review and approve a proof via the iOS app. As long as you download the app to your iOS device and access your personal URL via your iOS email app, then you can review and approve on the go.

>It is not possible to review SWF files or Audio files, such as MP3 on iOS devices, due to the software limitations of mobile devices. If you would like to review a proof created from a SWF file or an Audio file on a mobile device, please convert it to a supported format before uploading to [!DNL Workfront Proof].

## Getting started with the app

You do not have to be a [!DNL Workfront Proof] user to start using the app. Simply install the app on your device and click a **[!UICONTROL Go To Proof]** link in your email notification. The app automatically starts and loads the proof.
