# Unable to Log In to the [!DNL Workfront Proof] Mobile App

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

## Problem

When trying to log in to the [!DNL Workfront Proof] Mobile App it returns:

"Your Username or password is incorrect. Please try again."

This problem occurs when you launch the [!DNL Workfront Proof] Mobile App by itself because it attempts to log in to a stand-alone [!DNL Workfront Proof] system, not the one integrated with Workfront.

## Solution

When using both [!DNL Workfront] & [!DNL Workfront Proof],

1. Ensure that both the [!DNL Workfront] Mobile App and the [!DNL Workfront Proof] Mobile App are installed on your device.
1. Log in to the [!DNL Workfront] Mobile App and Go to the document you want to Proof.
1. Click the three-dot icon in the upper-right of the screen, then click **[!UICONTROL Proofing]**.
   The [!DNL Workfront Proof] Mobile App automatically launches logs you in.
   You can now work with proofing in the document.
