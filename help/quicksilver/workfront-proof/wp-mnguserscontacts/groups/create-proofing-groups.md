# Create Proofing Groups using [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [[!DNL Workfront] Plans](https://business.adobe.com/products/workfront/pricing.html).

You can create groups of users that you can add as reviewers on multiple proofs. This is useful if you send content to the same users regularly.

1. On the Dashboard, click the down arrow next to **[!UICONTROL New]**, then click **[!UICONTROL New group]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL New group]** box that appears, enter details for the Group (Group names can be up to 128 characters).

   Selecting **[!UICONTROL Private]** makes the Group visible only to you and the other members of the Group.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL People]** section, add or remove people from your Group, specifying their role and email alert options as necessary.

   If you need information about specifying roles, see [Manage Proof Roles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).

   If you need information about email alert options, see [Configure email notification settings in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
