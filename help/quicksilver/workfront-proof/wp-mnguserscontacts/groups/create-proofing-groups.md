>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [Workfront Plans.](https://www.workfront.com/plans)

You can create groups of users that you can add as reviewers on multiple proofs. This is useful if you send content to the same users regularly.

1. On the Dashboard, click the down arrow next to **New,** then click **New group**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL New group]** box that appears, enter details for the Group (Group names can be up to 128 characters).

   Selecting **[!UICONTROL Private]** makes the Group visible only to you and the other members of the Group.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL People]** section, add or remove people from your Group, specifying their role and email alert options as necessary.

   If you need information about specifying roles, see [[!UICONTROL Manage Proof Roles] in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).

   If you need information about email alert options, see [[!UICONTROL Configure email notification settings] in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).

1. Click **Save**.
