# Understand Users, Members, and Guests in [!DNL Workfront] Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront] Proof. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Users, Members, and Guests are the three types of contacts you can work with on the Contacts page.

See&nbsp; [Manage Your Contacts in [!DNL Workfront] Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/contacts/manage-contacts.md) for more information about the Contacts page.

* **Users**

   Users have a [!DNL Workfront] Proof login in your organization's account. If you are a [!DNL Workfront] Proof administrator, you can add a new user. See [Create Users using Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/users/create-users.md) for more information.

* **Members**

   Members have their own [!DNL Workfront] Proof login in another organization's account (not your own). You cannot convert members to users in your account.

* **Guests**

   Guests do not have their own Workfront Proof login in your organization's account, but you have added their details to your account (for example, guest reviewers on proofs). You can convert guests to users. For more information, see [Create Users using Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/users/create-users.md).
