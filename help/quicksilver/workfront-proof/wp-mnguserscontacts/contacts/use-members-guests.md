# Understand Users, Members, and Guests in Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Users, Members, and Guests are the three types of contacts you can work with on the Contacts page.

See&nbsp; [Manage Your Contacts in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/contacts/manage-contacts.md) for more information about the Contacts page.

* **Users**

  Users have a Workfront Proof login in your organization's account. If you are a Workfront Proof administrator, you can add a new user. See [Create Users using Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/users/create-users.md) for more information.

* **Members**

  Members have their own Workfront Proof login in another organization's account (not your own). You cannot convert members to users in your account.

* **Guests**

  Guests do not have their own Workfront Proof login in your organization's account, but you have added their details to your account (for example, guest reviewers on proofs). You can convert guests to users. For more information, see [Create Users using Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/users/create-users.md).
