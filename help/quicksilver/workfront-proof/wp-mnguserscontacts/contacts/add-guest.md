# Add a Guest to Workfront Proof

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Contacts are shared in an organization by default. So if you add a Guest, your Colleagues will see that person in their contacts list as well. For information about Guests and Collegues, see [Understand Users, Members, and Guests in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/contacts/use-members-guests.md).

Anyone you add to a proof will automatically be added to your contacts list. For information about adding reviewers to a proof, see [Share a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/share-proof.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Guests don't count towards your user limit - they appear only as entries on your Contacts page, for easier proofs sharing. Guests don't have Workfront Proof credentials, so you won't be able to share Login required proofs with them

To add a new Guest:

1. On the Dashboard, click the down arrow next to&nbsp;**New proof**, then click&nbsp;**New guest**.

1. If you have an Observer profile, you will not have the option to add new contacts. For more information, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).
1. Type the guest's information, then click **Create.**You can choose the default proof role and permissions&nbsp;for the new Guest. When this person is then added to a proof they will be given this role and alert by default, however these can be changed on the New proof page when adding them to the proof.   
   For more information, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md) and [Configure email notification settings in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/email-alerts/config-email-notification-settings-wp.md).
