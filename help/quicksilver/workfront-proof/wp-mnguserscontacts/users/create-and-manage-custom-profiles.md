# Create and Manage Custom Profiles using [!DNL Workfront Proof]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product [!DNL Workfront Proof]. For information on proofing inside [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

Billing Administrators and Administrators can create and manage custom profiles to specify what users can do in your organization's account and in Account settings.

This feature is available only on Premium accounts.

## Module Permissions {#module-permissions}

Module permissions let you decide what access you want your users to have over their own items and over items owned by other users in the account.

Basic access section determines if users can Read, Create, Edit, and Delete their own items in the account.

The [!UICONTROL Data administration] section determines rights users have over items owned by other users in the account.

Both sections allow you to grant rights over the following items in the account:

* Proofs
