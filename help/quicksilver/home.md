## Tips for finding content in Experience League

Searching documentation can be more efficient with a few strategic approaches. Here are some tips to help you find what you need effectively:

### Use the Table of Contents and Search bar 

* **Table of Contents**: Start with the table of contents to get an overview of available topics and narrow down to specific topics by expanding sections.
* **Search bar**: Use the search bar to find documentation. Enter specific terms related to your issue or topic. Instead of general terms like "project management," use "project timeline setup" or "task dependencies."

### Explore Learning and Training Sections

* **Training Materials**: Navigate to the [Workfront tutorials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-learn/tutorials-workfront/home) page for a library of training videos and articles designed to help you better understand Workfront features and settings. 
* **Courses**: Check for structured learning paths that guide you through using various Workfront features in a logical sequence.

### Find answers in Community Forums

* **Ask Questions**: If the documentation doesn't answer your question, try posting in the [Workfront Community forums](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/workfront/ct-p/workfront?profile.language=en) where other users and experts can offer assistance.
