# Overview of metadata in [!DNL Workfront Library]

Metadata is information that describes the attributes and content of an asset and enhances its searchability. Even though your organization might have thousands of assets in [!DNL Workfront Library], you can quickly locate the content you want using accurate and detailed metadata.

A [!DNL Workfront Library] administrator sets up the metadata to gather the types of information most useful for your organization. [!DNL Workfront Library] supports 2 types of metadata:

* **Taxonomy**: Information that describes or categorizes the attributes of an asset. For example, taxonomy might specify when an asset was created or the location of a photograph. For more information on taxonomy, see [Overview of taxonomy metadata in [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/taxonomy-metadata-overview.md).

* **Keywords**: Terms that describe an asset. For example, keywords for the following image might include: running, woman, athlete, running shoe, desert, Titan Running, outdoors, turquoise, and race.

   For more information on keywords, see [Overview of keyword metadata in [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/keyword-metadata-overview.md)

When you upload an asset to [!DNL Workfront Library], you specify the applicable metadata in the [!UICONTROL Metadata] panel.

The metadata is then saved with the asset. When users search or filter for content, [!DNL Workfront Library] combs through metadata to identify assets with applicable metadata.

Additionally, documents sent to [!DNL Workfront Library] from [!DNL Workfront], might include [!DNL Workfront] metadata, such as the project name, [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date], and assigned team. For information on sending documents from [!DNL Workfront], see [Configure document integrations](../../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-document-integrations.md).

When you open an item in [!DNL Workfront Library], you can view its metadata in the [!UICONTROL Details] panel on the right.
