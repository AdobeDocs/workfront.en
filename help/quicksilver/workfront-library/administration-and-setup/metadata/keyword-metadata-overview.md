# Overview of keyword metadata in Workfront Library

Keywords are a type of metadata that uses specific terms to&nbsp;describe the content of an asset. Applying consistent keyword metadata to content allows users to quickly find and filter the assets they need for their work. For information about metadata and how it is used in Workfront Library, see [Overview of metadata in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/metadata-overview.md).

Users apply keywords when they upload new assets to Workfront Library. Users can also add or edit keyword metadata on shared assets to which they have Manage permissions.

When a user opens an asset, the applied metadata displays in the Details panel.

Workfront Library supports a hierarchical keyword structure, which allows you to refine the categorization of an asset and increase its searchability. As a Workfront Library administrator, you configure and maintain your organization's keyword metadata through the keyword picklist. In the picklist hierarchy, you enter the main keyword, which acts as a category. You can then add unlimited levels of child/grandchild keywords to the main keyword. When a user applies a child/grandchild keyword to an asset's metadata, Workfront Library automatically applies all the hierarchically-related keywords to the asset.

In the example above, the user entered 

```
sunglasses
```

in the Keywords box. Workfront added the main keyword (Womens) and all the associated hierarchically-related keywords (Accessories, Glasses) to the asset's keyword metatdata.

Because users can apply only keywords from the picklist to an asset, it is important that the picklist be as detailed and comprehensive as possible.

Consider the following when configuring your organization's keyword picklist:

* We recommend that you first&nbsp;determine the types of information your users would likely search for. You can then add descriptive and relevant terms to your keyword picklist to support your users' search habits.&nbsp;
* Keywords are not case-sensitive. This allows your users to receive relevant search results regardless of whether they enter upper or lower cased search terms.
* To bolster your keyword picklist, include both the singular and the plural versions of each keyword.

For more information on ways to manage keywords, see the following articles:

* [Add keywords to metadata in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/add-keywords-to-metadata.md) 
* [Delete a keyword from the picklist in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/delete-keyword-from-metadata.md)
