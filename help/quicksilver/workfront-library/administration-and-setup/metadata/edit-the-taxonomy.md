# Edit a taxonomy metadata field in [!DNL Workfront] Library

As your organization's digital content collection grows in [!DNL Workfront] Library, you might find that your taxonomy needs to be updated. Only a [!DNL Workfront] Library administrator can edit taxonomy. For more information about taxonomy, see [Overview of taxonomy metadata in [!DNL Workfront] Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/taxonomy-metadata-overview.md).

You can make the following modifications to a taxonomy field:

* Change the field name
* Add or delete values in a single- or multi-select field

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You cannot change a single-select field to be a multi-select field, or a multi-select field to be a single-select field.

* Enable or disable the Required Field toggle

Any changes you make to the taxonomy are applied to the metadata of all new assets uploaded. The changes do not apply to assets already in [!DNL Workfront] Library. However, when a user opens an asset that was in [!DNL Workfront] library prior to the changes you made to the taxonomy, the modified taxonomy is applied to the asset's Detail panel.
