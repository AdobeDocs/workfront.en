# Give users access to [!DNL Workfront Library]

Before users can open [!DNL Workfront Library], they must be given access. As a [!DNL Workfront Library] administrator, you can give your users the following types of access:

* **Individual**: Access that you grant to individual users
* **User grouping**: Access that users receive through their membership in a job role, team, group, or company that you've added to [!DNL Workfront Library]

When you add individual users and user groupings to [!DNL Workfront Library], you assign them an access level. This access level determines what actions users can take with the content that is shared with them. For information on [!DNL Workfront Library] access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md) and [Permissions in [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/permissions-in-workfront-library.md).

Each access level grants specific permissions that affect what a user can do with the assets shared with them.
