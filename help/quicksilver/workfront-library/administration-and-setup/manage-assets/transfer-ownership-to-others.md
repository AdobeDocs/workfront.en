# Transfer ownership assets to another user

As a Workfront Library administrator, you can transfer all of the asset in a user's My Content area to a different user.

## Transfer all assets

To transfer all of a user's content:

1. In Workfront, click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png), then select **Library** to open Workfront Library in a new browser tab.
1. In the upper-left corner of Workfront Library, click the **Menu** icon.
1. In the left panel, click **Setup** > **Users**.

   On the Users screen, you can see a list of Workfront Library users.

1. (Optional) To locate a user that no longer has access to Workfront Library, click the **Filter** icon in the top-right corner and select **Deactivated users** from the drop-down list that appears.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Only deactivated users that still own assets appear in this area. After you transfer assets from a deactivated user, they are removed from this list.

1. Hover over a user's row, click the More menu next to the user's name, and select **Transfer asset ownership** from the drop-down list that appears.
