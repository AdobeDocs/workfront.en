# Access older versions of content in Workfront Library

As a user with Manage permission to content, you can use Workfront Library to view and download all iterations of content through the versioning feature.&nbsp;For more on managing versioning content, see [Overview of content versioning in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/content-versioning/content-versioning-overview.md).

In Workfront Library, the active (or current) version of content is packaged together with its older versions. In order to access an older version of content, you must first open the active version.

You cannot search for an older version of content. Instead, you must search for the name of the active version. Once you have the active version open, you access the older versions.

Users with View permission to content can view only the active version.

1. In Workfront, click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png), then select **Library** to open Workfront Library in a new browser tab.
