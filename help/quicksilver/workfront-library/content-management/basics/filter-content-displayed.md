# Filter content displayed in [!DNL Workfront Library]

Each filter on the [!UICONTROL Filter] panel contains facets, which are filters that allow you to specify the exact content you want to view. A facet filters content based on the metadata attached to content files.

If your organization allows you to add keywords to uploaded content, you can enhance your filtering by selecting the keywords you want to filter for.
