# Download items from Workfront Library

You can download any item to which you have permissions. For information on access and permissions, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md)

## Understand downloading items

You can download the following items from Workfront or from a portal:

* Content
* Folders
* Collections

Depending on how your Workfront Library administrator set up Workfront Library, users with Viewer access to Workfront Library might not be able to download expired content. For more information on the expiration feature, see [Set up content expiration in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/workfront-library-setup/set-up-content-expiration-in-library.md).

Content that you download is saved to the area you designate in your browser. For downloading large files and groups of items, such as folders and collections, Workfront Library places the items in a .zip file and emails the file to you.

Only the XMP and EXIF metadata downloads with content files.

You can change the file format of an item you download. Only the format of the downloaded file is changed. The format of the file in Workfront Library remains unchanged.

If you change the file format of the item and then upload it back to Workfront Library, the item is treated as a new version. If the item is an image file, XMP and EXIF metadata of the orginal file is not applied to the new version. For more information see, [Upload a new version of content in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/content-versioning/upload-new-version-of-content.md).
