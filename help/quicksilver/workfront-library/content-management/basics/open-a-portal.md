# Open a Workfront Library portal

When a Workfront Library administrator adds you to a portal, Workfront sends you an email invitation with a link that opens the portal.

Before you can open a portal, you must be given access to it by your Workfront Library administrator or a user with Manager access to the portal. For information on inviting users to a portal, see [Give users access to a Workfront Library portal](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/give-users-access-portal.md).

## Open a portal for the first time

When you are first given access to a portal, Workfront sends you an email invitation with a link to the portal.

1. In the portal invitation email sent from Workfront, click **See Shared Content**.

   The portal opens. Your access level to assets within the portal determines the activities you can do while in the portal.

## Open a portal from within Workfront Library

1. ```<li> <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">In Workfront, click the <strong>Main Menu</strong> icon <img src="assets/main-menu-icon.png">, then select <strong>Library</strong> to open Workfront Library in a new browser tab.</p> </li>``` If the Workfront Library icon does not display on your Global Navigation Bar, then you don't have access to Workfront Library. Talk with your Workfront Library administrator for access.
