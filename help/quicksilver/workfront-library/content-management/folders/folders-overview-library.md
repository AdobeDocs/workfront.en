# Overview of folders in [!DNL Workfront] Library

Folders enable you to logically organize items that you own or that you have Manage permissions to.&nbsp;You can create as many levels of folders and subfolders as you need based on how your organization manages digital content. For example, you could create a folder structure arranged by client, job, campaign, department, and so on.

In order to create and maintain content folders, you must have [!DNL Manager] or higher access to [!DNL Workfront] Library. Additionally, to add content and subfolders to a folder, you must have [!DNL Manage] permissions to the folder. For information on access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to [!DNL Workfront] Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md)

Users with Viewer access to [!DNL Workfront] Library cannot create folders, but they can view and download the contents of a folder that is shared with them. For information on sharing folders, see [Share a Workfront Library item with other users](../../../workfront-library/content-management/share-an-asset-with-users.md).

You can add folders to a collection you create. If you have Manage permissions to a folder, you can add that folder to a collection that has been shared with you. For information on addition folders to collections, see [Add items to a collection in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/collections/add-items-to-a-collection.md).

When you create a folder, you are the owner of the folder. There can be only one owner of a folder; however, a folder owner can share the folder and give Manage permissions to multiple users.&nbsp;For information about creating a folder, see [Create a folder in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/folders/create-a-folder-library.md).

By giving permissions to other users, you give them access to all the contents of the folder, including the contents of any subfolder within the folder. A user's permissions level to a parent folder applies to all subfolders under the parent folder.

You can search for a folder by its name. For information on using the Search feature, see [Search for items in [!DNL Workfront] Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/basics/search-for-items-in-workfront-library.md)
