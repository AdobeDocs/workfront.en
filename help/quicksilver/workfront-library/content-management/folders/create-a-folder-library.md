# Create a folder in [!DNL Workfront Library]

If you have [!UICONTROL Manager] or higher access to [!DNL Workfront Library] you can create folders to organize content. By nesting folders, you can create a folder structure that makes finding content quick and easy.

When you create a folder, you have the option to select the image you want as the folder cover image. If you don't select a cover image, the folder thumbnail is gray as long as the folder remains empty. When you upload content to the folder, [!DNL Workfront Library] randomly selects a cover image from the files uploaded to the folder. If a folder contains only subfolders, the cover remains gray.

For information on changing the cover image, see [Change the cover image on an item in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/change-cover-image-of-folder.md).

Users with [!UICONTROL Manager] or high access can create an unlimited number of folders. Users with Viewer access cannot create folders.

&nbsp;For more information about folders, see [Overview of folders in [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../../workfront-library/content-management/folders/folders-overview-library.md).

1. In [!DNL Workfront], click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png), then select **[!DNL Library]** to open [!DNL Workfront Library] in a new browser tab.
1. In the upper-left corner of [!DNL Workfront Library], click the **Menu** icon ![](assets/library-menu-icon.png).
1. Navigate to where you want to add a folder.

   You can add a folder to your [!UICONTROL Library] or [!UICONTROL My Content] areas and to any collection that you have access to. You can also create sub-folders within an existing folder.

1. (Conditional) If you are in the list view, click the **[!UICONTROL Show grid view]** icon ![](assets/grid-view-icon.png) to switch to the grid view.

1. Type a name for the folder, then press **[!UICONTROL Enter]**.

   When you navigate to another area of [!DNL Workfront Library], the newly-created folder is placed in alphabetical order with the other folders in the area.

1. (Optional) Select a cover image for the folder:

   1. Hover over the folder you just created, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** icon in the upper-right corner of the folder, then click **[!UICONTROL Select cover image]** in the drop-down menu.
   1. Navigate to the image you want displayed on the folder cover.

      You can choose from content in your [!UICONTROL Library] or [!UICONTROL My Content] areas. You cannot use an expired or hidden item as a cover image.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The image you select remains as the cover image, even if the asset is updated with a new version or is deleted from [!DNL Workfront Library].

   1. Select the image, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

      The image displays on the folder cover. You might need to refresh your browser tab to see the folder cover.

You can now add content and folders to the folder you just created. For more information, see [Add items to a folder in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/folders/add-items-to-a-folder-library.md).
