   >[!TIP]
   >
   >When you use the Remove from Collection option, the item is removed from the collection, but remains in Workfront Library. Only a Workfront Library administrator can delete content from Workfront Library. For information on deleting assets, see [Delete items from Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/delete-items.md)

1. Click **Remove** to confirm you want to remove the item.

   The item is removed from the collection.

   If the item you removed was used for the cover image on the collection, it remains as the cover image even though the item is no longer in the collection.
