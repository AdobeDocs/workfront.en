   >[!TIP]
   >
   >When you use the [!UICONTROL Remove from Collection] option, the item is removed from the collection, but remains in [!DNL Workfront] Library. Only a [!DNL Workfront] Library administrator can delete content from [!DNL Workfront] Library. For information on deleting assets, see [Delete items from Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/delete-items.md)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Remove]** to confirm you want to remove the item.

   The item is removed from the collection.

   If the item you removed was used for the cover image on the collection, it remains as the cover image even though the item is no longer in the collection.
