# Create a collection in [!DNL Workfront Library]

You can organize content by adding it to collections that you have created or that have been shared with you. For information on sharing collections, see [Share a Workfront Library item with other users](../../../workfront-library/content-management/share-an-asset-with-users.md).

When you create a collection, you have the option to select the image you want as the collection cover image. If you don't select a cover image, the collection thumbnail is gray as long as the collection remains empty. When you add content to the collection, [!DNL Workfront Library] randomly selects a cover image from the added content. If a collection contains only folders, the cover remains gray.
