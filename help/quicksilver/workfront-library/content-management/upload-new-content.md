# Upload content to [!DNL Workfront Library]

If you have [!UICONTROL Manager] or higher access to [!DNL Workfront Library], you can upload new content.

## Understand uploading content to [!DNL Workfront Library]

When you upload new content, [!DNL Workfront Library] designates you as the owner of that content and uploads it to your [!UICONTROL My Content] area. Initially, only you and users with Admin access to [!DNL Workfront Library] can access the content. You can give others access to the content by sharing it with them. For information on sharing items, see [&#128279;](../../workfront-library/content-management/share-an-asset-with-users.md) [Share a [!DNL Workfront Library] item with other users](../../workfront-library/content-management/share-an-asset-with-users.md).

You can upload a single file or a batch of files.&nbsp;While there is no limit&nbsp;on the number of files you can batch upload, performance is significantly affected when you upload 10 or more files.

Before being uploaded, each file is processed to extract any Exif and XMP metadata embedded on the file. For information about metadata, see [Overview of metadata in [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/metadata-overview.md).

You can enter additional metadata for each file individually or for multiple files. Before a file can be uploaded to [!DNL Workfront Library], all the required metadata fields must be filled in.

You can also add documents that are uploaded to projects, tasks, or issues in [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Workfront Library]. For information on adding documents from [!DNL Workfront], see [Send documents from [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../workfront-library/content-management/send-documents-from-wf-to-library.md).

There is no restriction on the file size or types of files that can be uploaded to [!DNL Workfront Library].

You cannot upload a file using third-party applications such as [!DNL Google Drive] and [!DNL SharePoint].

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Workfront Library] does not prevent duplicate filenames. If you upload a file that has the same filename of a file already in [!DNL Workfront Library], you will have two files with the same filename.
