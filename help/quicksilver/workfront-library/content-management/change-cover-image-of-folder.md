# Change the cover image on an item in Workfront Library

When you change the cover image, it is changed for all users who have access to the folder or collection.

   You can choose any asset thumbnails in your Library, My Content, or Collections areas. You cannot use an expired or hidden item as a cover image.

   The new image displays on the cover of the folder.

   The cover image you select remains as the cover image, even if the asset is updated with a new version or is deleted from Workfront Library.
