# Send documents from [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Workfront Library]

With [!UICONTROL Manager] or higher access to [!DNL Workfront Library], you can send a copy of a document that is uploaded to a project, task, or issue in [!DNL Workfront] to folders that you own or folders that you have access to Manage.

The [!DNL Workfront] copy of the document is not linked to the copy in [!DNL Workfront Library], and changes made to one copy of the document are not updated in the other copy. Additionally, if you send a new version of a document that is already in [!DNL Workfront Library], the new version is uploaded as a separate file with the same name as the original version.

To learn how to send a document from [!DNL Workfront Library] to [!DNL Workfront], see [Add a Workfront Library asset to Workfront](../../workfront-library/content-management/add-a-wf-library-asset.md).

1. In [!DNL Workfront], navigate to the document you want to send to [!DNL Workfront Library].

1. In the [!UICONTROL Send to Workfront Library] dialog box, select either **[!UICONTROL My Content]** or **[!UICONTROL Library]**. The folder structure of the selected area displays.

1. (Optional) To place the document in a folder, open the desired folder.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next].**

   The [!UICONTROL Metadata] panel for the document displays. Depending on how your metadata taxonomy is set up, some of the metadata fields might be prepopulated with metadata from [!DNL Workfront], for example, the project name.

   A copy of the document is sent to [!DNL Workfront Library].
