# Bulk edit metadata in [!DNL Workfront Library]

Metadata consists of information that describes the attributes and content of an asset. Users can edit the metadata of multiple assets at once. For more information about metadata, see [Overview of Metadata in [!DNL Workfront Library]](../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/metadata-overview.md).

To bulk edit metadata:

1. In [!DNL Workfront], click the **[!DNL Workfront Library]** icon on the Global Navigation Bar to open [!UICONTROL Workfront Library] in a new browser tab.

   In [!DNL Workfront], click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png), then select **[!DNL Library]** to open [!DNL Workfront Library] in a new browser tab.

1. In the upper-left corner of [!DNL Workfront Library], click the **[!UICONTROL Menu]** icon.
1. Select the area where the asset is located:

   * **[!UICONTROL Library]**
   * **[!UICONTROL My Content]**
   * **[!UICONTROL Collections]**

1. On your keyboard, hold the **CTRL** key—or **COMMAND** key for Mac users—and click on each thumbnail of the asset you would like to edit metadata for.
1. After selecting all assets, click the **[!UICONTROL Details Slideout]** icon ![](assets/details-icon.png)in the upper-right corner to display the metadata details for the selected assets.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Details] slideout, click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

   Any changes you make during these edits are applied to all selected assets. If the selections for a field vary between assets, the text "[!UICONTROL Mixed]" appears in the field.

1. (Optional) Enter a new **[!UICONTROL Expiration Date]** or click the **[!UICONTROL No Date]** checkbox. When the assets reach the expiration date, users with [!UICONTROL View] access can no longer see the content.
1. Make changes to the remainder of the metadata fields to update all selected assets.

   >   * **Single-select**: To add a new option, click the field, then select the desired option.
   >   * **Text Field**: To add a new option, enter text in the field.


1. In the **[!UICONTROL Keywords]** area, the keywords for all selected assets display. Click the drop-down to select or deselect keywords for all selected assets.

   If a keyword is applied to all assets, a check mark appears in the checkbox. If a keyword is applied to only some of the selected assets, a dash appears in the checkbox.
