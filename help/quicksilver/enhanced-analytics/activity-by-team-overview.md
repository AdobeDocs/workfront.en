# View the Activity by team visualization in Enhanced analytics

The Activity by team visualization shows activities that happen during a specific time frame for a home team, allowing you to understand how different home teams spent their time in Adobe Workfront. Depending on how your home team is set up in Workfront, this visualization can give you different insights and answer different questions.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Project activity visualization is similar to this visualization, but it displays activity based on people assigned to projects rather than people assigned to a home team.  
>For information on the Project activity visualization, see [View the Project activity visualization in Enhanced analytics](../enhanced-analytics/project-activity-overview.md).

The different activities display in different colors to summarize specific events over the filtered time period:

* **Users logged in**: Purple boxes show that people on the home team logged in on that day. A darker shade indicates a higher number of people logging in.

  ![](assets/project-activity-users-logged-in.png)

* **Task status change**: Pink boxes show that people on the home team changed the status of a task on that day. A darker shade indicates a higher number of task statuses changing.

  ![](assets/project-activity-task-status-changes.png)

* **Tasks completed**: Blue boxes show that people on the home team completed a task on that day. A darker shade indicates a higher number of tasks being completed.

  ![](assets/project-activity-tasks-completed.png)

Hovering over a box shows the exact number of times the action was completed in a given day. You can select a team to see a breakdown of these activities by each person on the home team.

Seeing this information helps you determine:

* What activities are occurring within a home team and at what rate.
* What home teams are being overworked or are using the system more.
* If the distribution of work is appropriate for the home team.
