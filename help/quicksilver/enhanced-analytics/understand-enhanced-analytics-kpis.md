description: At the top of the screen in the Enhanced analytics area, 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) display. These metrics allow you to quickly understand how long projects are taking, how big the projects are, and how many projects are being completed within a specific time frame. These numbers are not limited to the 50-project maximum that displays for the visualizations on this page. Instead, this data is based on all projects that apply to any set filters, and these numbers adjust if you change the selected date range or any of the filters.

At the top of the screen in the Enhanced analytics area, 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) display. These metrics allow you to quickly understand how long projects are taking, how big the projects are, and how many projects are being completed within a specific time frame. These numbers are not limited to the 50-project maximum that displays for the visualizations on this page. Instead, this data is based on all projects that apply to any set filters, and these numbers adjust if you change the selected date range or any of the filters.

To learn how to add filters, see [Apply filters in Enhanced analytics](../enhanced-analytics/use-enhanced-analytics-filters.md).

## Projects completed

The Projects completed KPI shows how many projects within the filtered time period have been completed, as well as how the percentage increased or decreased since the previous time period. Below these numbers, you can see the number of projects completed in the previous time period, as well as the number of days in the previous time period.

## Avg. project duration

The Avg. project duration KPI shows the average amount of completion time—in days, weeks, or years—for projects with actual end dates within the filtered time period, as well as how the percentage increased or decreased since the previous time period. Below these numbers, you can see the average amount of completion time for projects with actual end dates in the previous time period, as well as the number of days in the previous time period.
