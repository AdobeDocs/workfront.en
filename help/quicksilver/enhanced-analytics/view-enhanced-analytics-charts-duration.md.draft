# View Enhanced analytics visualizations by duration

If your teams do not use planned hours, you can select a duration view of the project data for the following visualizations:

* Burndown  
  To learn more about the Burndown visualization, see [View the Burndown visualization in Enhanced analytics](../enhanced-analytics/burndown-overview.md).

* Project treemap  
  To learn more about the Project treemap visualization, see [View the Project treemap visualization in Enhanced analytics](../enhanced-analytics/project-treemap-overview.md).

In Enhanced analytics, the duration of a project is calculated by the following formulas:

* Planned Timeframe: 

  ```
  Planned Completion Date of the project - Start Date of the project
  ```

* Days Worked: 

  ```
  Planned Duration for tasks completed in the selected date range / Typical hours per work day
  ```

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >8 hours is the default number for **Typical hours per work day**. An Adobe Workfront administrator can update the **Typical hours per work day** setting under **Setup** > **Project Preferences** > **Projects** > **Timelines**.  
  >To learn more, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

For information on Planned Duration, see [Overview of project Duration](../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-duration.md).
