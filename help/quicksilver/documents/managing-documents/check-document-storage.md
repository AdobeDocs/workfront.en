# Check document storage limits

While there are no restrictions on the types and sizes of individual files that users can upload to your Workfront instance, there is a limit on your Workfront Plan on the total amount of storage used by your Workfront instance. As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you monitor your instance's document storage from the Setup area.
