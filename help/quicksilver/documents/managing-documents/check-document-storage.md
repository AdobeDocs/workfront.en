As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you monitor your instance's document storage from the Setup area.

## Check document storage

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. In the left panel, click **System** > **Customer Info**.
1. In the **Basic Info** section, find **Storage Quota**. Here, you can view how much storage you're currently using as well as the total amount storage your Workfront Plan includes. 

The storage quota is refreshed daily to show the most up-to-date count.

   >This limit does not apply to documents you link to Workfront from any other third-party service provider (SharePoint, Google Drive, Webdam, Box, Dropbox, any other Document Asset Management provider).
