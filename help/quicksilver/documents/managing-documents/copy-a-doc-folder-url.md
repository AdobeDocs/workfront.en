# Copy and share a link to a document folder

You can copy a direct link for any document folder contained in any of the following [!DNL Workfront] objects: [!UICONTROL Program], [!UICONTROL Portfolio], [!UICONTROL Project], [!UICONTROL Task], or [!UICONTROL Issue]. You can't copy a link for any folders contained in the [!UICONTROL Documents] area from the Main Menu, as those folders are linked directly to your user profile and can't be shared with others.

To copy a link to a document folder:

1. Navigate to the [!DNL Workfront] object that contains the document folder. 
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu, then select **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]**. You can share this link to provide quick access to the folder. Users must have at least View access to the object to view the folder.
