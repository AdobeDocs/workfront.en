# Document approvals and proofing

You can ask users to approve a document you upload to Workfront. For information, see [Request document approvals](../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/request-document-approvals.md).

You can also ask users to review a document as a proof in Adobe Workfront using the proofing viewer. The proofing viewer contains tools for marking content and making comments. For information, see [Create proofs](../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-proofs--in-wf.md).
