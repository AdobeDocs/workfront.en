# Upload a new version of a document

You can add a new version of a document you have previously uploaded to Adobe Workfront.

If the file name of the new version is different from the file name of the previous version, Workfront displays the document with the newer file name.

If the document contains a proof and you want to create a new version of the proofed document, see the section [Upload a document and create a new version of a proof](../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof-for-a-document.md#uploading-a-document-and-creating-a-new-version-of-a-proof) in the article [Create a proof for a document](../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof-for-a-document.md).

For information about adding a new version of a document linked to Workfront from an external application, see [Add a new version of a linked document](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md#add) in [Link documents from external applications](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

## Access requirements
