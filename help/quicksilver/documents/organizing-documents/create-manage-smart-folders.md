# Create and Manage Smart Folders

Smart folders are used to manage documents outside of a project, task, or issue, and&nbsp;are found in the main Documents&nbsp;area in the Main Menu . You can set up a smart folder to filter assets and display only those important to you, rather than searching through all of your assets.

Two smart folders are available to you by default the first time you access the Documents&nbsp;area: All Documents, and Recent. You can edit, rename, or copy default smart folders, but you cannot delete them. You can&nbsp;create additional smart folders to meet other asset management needs.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Review or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
