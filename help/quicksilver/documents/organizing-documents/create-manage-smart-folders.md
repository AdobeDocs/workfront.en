# Create and Manage Smart Folders

Smart folders are used to manage documents outside of a project, task, or issue, and&nbsp;are found in the main Documents&nbsp;area in the Main Menu . You can set up a smart folder to filter assets and display only those important to you, rather than searching through all of your assets.

Two smart folders are available to you by default the first time you access the Documents&nbsp;area: All Documents, and Recent. You can edit, rename, or copy default smart folders, but you cannot delete them. You can&nbsp;create additional smart folders to meet other asset management needs.
