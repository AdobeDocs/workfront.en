# Send a Document to Experience Manager Assets or Assets Essentials

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.</span>

You can send documents from Workfront to Experience Manager Assets or Assets Essentials. Documents uploaded and sent from Workfront to Assets Essentials still count against your overall document storage. Assets linked from Assets Essentials don't count towards overall storage.

Metadata fields are first mapped when you send an asset from Workfront to Experience Manager Assets or Assets Essentials. <span class="preview">Any metadata configured to map for parent objects is sent as well. For more information on configuring metadata mapping, see [Configure the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md) or [Configure the Experience Manager Assets Essentials integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/setup-asset-essentials.md).</span>

>[!INFO]

><span class="preview">**Example** When you first send an asset attached to a task, the task metadata maps to Experience Manager Assets or Assets Essentials as well as any mapped metadata from parent objects such as a project, portfolio, and program.</span>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, 

* Your Workfront Administrator must configure an Experience Manager integration. For more information, see [Configure the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md) or [Configure the Experience Manager Assets Essentials integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/setup-asset-essentials.md).


## Send a Document from Workfront

When a user sends a document from Workfront to Experience Manager Assets or Assets Essentials, mapped metadata transfers along the document. After the document is sent, changes made to the document's metadata in Workfront are not reflected in Assets or Assets Essentials. If a mapped field in Workfront is changed, you must send a new version of the document with the updated metadata to Assets or Assets Essentials. To set up or edit metadata, see [Configure the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md) or [Configure the Experience Manager Assets Essentials integration](../../documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/setup-asset-essentials.md).

To send a document:

1. Go to the **Documents** area in Workfront, and select the document you want to send.
1. Click **Send to**, then choose the Experience Manager integration your administrator set up.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The Workfront administrator can choose any name for this integration, so it may not specifically mention Assets or Assets Essentials.

   ![](assets/copy-of-send-to-in-toolbar-350x149.png)

1. Choose where you want the asset to go, then click **Select Folder**.
1. When you find your desired destination, click **Save**.

## Send a new version

You can add a new version to a document you have previously uploaded to Workfront. For more information, see [Upload a new version of a document](../../documents/managing-documents/upload-new-document-version.md). After the latest version is uploaded, you can send it to Assets Essentials. If a mapped field in Workfront has changed, the new version updates the metadata in Assets Essentials when it sends.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Before you upload a new version to Workfront, we recommend renaming the file. If you upload a new version with the exact same file name as a previous version, only the most recent version can be downloaded from Workfront. All versions can be downloaded from Experience Manager Assets or Assets Essentials regardless of the file name.

To send the most recent version:

1. Go to the **Documents** area in Workfront, and locate the document.
1. Select **Send to**, then choose the Experience Manager integration your administrator set up.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The Workfront administrator can choose any name for this integration, so it might not specifically mention Assets or Assets Essentials.

   ![](assets/copy-of-send-to-in-toolbar-350x149.png)

1. Click **Save**. The new version saves in the same location as the previous version.
