# Use workflows in the Experience Manager Assets integration

A workflow is a set of actions that connect Workfront to Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. A Workfront administrator can configure workflows in Workfront, then assign them to Project Templates. When a Project is created using a Project Template to which a workflow is assigned, the actions defined in the workflow are triggered. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Workflows are available only in an Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service integration. They are not available in integrations with Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials.
