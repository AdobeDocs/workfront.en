# Use workflows in the Experience Manager Assets integration

A workflow is a set of actions that connect Workfront to Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. A Workfront administrator can configure workflows in Workfront, then assign them to Project Templates. 

When a Project is created using a Project Template to which a workflow is assigned, the actions defined in the workflow are triggered. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Workflows are available only in an Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service integration. They are not available in integrations with Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin,

* Your Workfront administrator must configure workflows in an Adobe Experience Manager integration. For more information, see [Configure the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service integration](../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md#set-up-workflows-optional).

## Add a workflow to a template 

You can add a workflow to a project template. The workflow will be applied to any projects created from the template.

1. Open a template by clicking **Templates** in the Main Menu, then selecting the template from the list.
1. Click **Experience Manager Assets** in the left navigation panel.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the Experience Manager Assets section is not visible in the left navigation, your Workfront administrator has not enabled workflows for your organization. <!--Is this right?-->

1. In the **Select an integration for automated workflows field**, select the integration with the workflows you want to use for projects created from this template.
1. (Optional) Edit any workflow values that you want to apply to projects created from this template. 

   For instructions on specific workflows, see [Edit workflow values in a project](#edit-workflow-values-in-a-project) in this article.

   Only workflows that have been activated in the Experience Manager area of Setup are available in templates or projects.

1. Your changes save automatically. <!-- do they though??-->

## Add a workflow to a project

You can add a workflow when creating a project, or add a workflow to an existing project. In both cases, you will use a project template to add the workflow.

### Add a workflow when creating a project

1. Begin creating a project.

   For instructions, see [Create a project using a template](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project-from-template.md).

1. When selecting a template for the project, select the template that contains the workflows you want to use for this project.
1. (Optional) Edit any workflow values for the project, as described in [Edit workflow values in a project](#edit-workflow-values-in-a-project).

   Only workflows that have been activated in the Experience Manager area of Setup are available in templates or projects.


### Add a workflow to an existing project

>[!NOTE]
>
>Workflows that run when a project is created (such as linked folder creation) do not run when the template is attached to an existing project. They only run when a project is created from a template.

1. Begin adding a template to the project.

   For instructions, see [Attach a template to a project](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/attach-template-to-project.md).

1. When selecting a template for the project, select the template that contains the workflows you want to use for this project.
1. (Optional) Edit any workflow values for the project, as described in [Edit workflow values in a project](#edit-workflow-values-in-a-project).

   Only workflows that have been activated in the Experience Manager area of Setup are available in templates or projects.



### Edit workflow values in a project

You can edit workflow values on the project level. Project-level workflow values override values set on the project template, which override the default values set in the Adobe Experience Manager Assets integration.

All workflow values can be found in:

* The Workflows or Linked folders section of the Create project or Edit project window.
* The Adobe Experience Manager section of the left navigation.


   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If these areas are not visible, your Workfront administrator has not enabled Workflows for your organization.



#### Linked folders

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because linked folders are created when the project is created, editing the linked folder workflow on an existing project is ineffective. Editing these values when creating a project functions as expected.

To edit the workflow for linked folders:

1. Toggle the **[!UICONTROL Create Linked folder]** on or off as desired. If you toggle it on, you can then edit the linked folder configuration.

   For details on the linked folder configuration, see [Create Adobe Experience Manager linked folders](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md#create-adobe-experience-manager-linked-folders) in the article [Configure the [!UICONTROL Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service] integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md).

1. (Optional) If you want the folder tree to be built only if certain values are present on a custom form attached to the project, click the **Apply filter** for that folder tree, then select the custom form that contains the field, the field, and the field value. If the field on the custom form attached to the new project contains the chosen value, the folder tree will be created.
1. (Optional) When configuring folder names, you can select from the following options:

   * **Name**: Type in a name for the folder. 

   * **Object data**: Select the source for the folder name, such as Project name. 

   * **Custom form data**: Select the custom form data to use as the folder name. 

      Using custom form data for folder names is available only at the template level, and cannot be configured at the integration level.

      If a folder name is set to custom data that does not exist on the custom for attached to the project, a random ID will be assigned as the folder name.

1. To view the folder tree, click the **Preview** ![Preview icon](assets/preview-icon.png) icon
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

#### Publishing assets

To edit the workflow for publishing assets:

1. Toggle **Publish assets automatically** on or off as desired.
1. (Conditional) If you are enabling publishing, select whether you want to publish  to the publish service, the brand portal, or both.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
