## Prerequisites

Before you begin: 

* Your Workfront Administrator must configure an Experience Manager integration. For more information, see [Configure the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md) or [Configure the Experience Manager Assets Essentials integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/setup-asset-essentials.md).

## Create a Proof

You can create static, video, or interactive proofs.

To create a proof:

1. Go to the project, task, or issue where you want the proof, then click the **Documents** section.
1. Hover over the document, then click the **Create Proof** link that appears below the document name.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you have **Automatically generate proofs when uploading documents** enabled in your user profile, the system automatically creates a simple proof.

1. Choose one of the following from the drop-down:  

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Simple Proof</strong></td> 
      <td>This option creates a proof with no workflow attached and applies the default proof settings. You can update the default proof settings or add a workflow after you've created the proof. For more information on proof settings, see <a href="../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/edit-proof-settings.md" class="MCXref xref">Edit proof settings</a>.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Advanced Proof</strong></td> 
      <td> <p>This option allows you to configure a Basic or Advanced workflow and modify proof settings for the proof you create. For more information, see: </p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> <p><a href="../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/configure-basic-proof-workflow.md" class="MCXref xref">Create an advanced proof with a Basic workflow</a> </p> </li> 
        <li> <p><a href="../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-automated-proof-workflow.md" class="MCXref xref">Create an advanced proof with an Automated workflow</a> </p> </li> 
       </ul> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

## Manage an existing proof

Once you've created a proof, you can do the following:

* View current stage activity
* Update reviewers and deadlines
* Edit the workflow

For more information about how to manage an existing proof, see [Manage proofs within Adobe Workfront: article index](../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/manage-proofs-in-wf.md).

## Review a proof

Assigned reviewers can do the following:

* View the asset and make comments
* Add actions to comments
* Compare versions
* Approve or reject the proof

For more information about what you can do with the proofing tool, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront: article index](../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).
