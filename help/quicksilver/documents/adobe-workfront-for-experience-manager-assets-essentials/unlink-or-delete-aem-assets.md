# Unlink or delete assets and folders from Experience Manager Assets or Assets Essentials

You can unlink or delete items linked to Workfront from Adobe Experience Manager Assets. 

## Delete a linked document or folder in Workfront

When you delete a linked document or folder in Workfront, it is unlinked from Experience Manager Assets and is deleted in Workfront only. The document or asset is not affected in Experience Manager Assets.

1. Select the linked document or folder, then click **Delete**.
1. In the confirmation box that appears, click **Yes, Unlink it**.

   The document is unlinked from the Workfront site. It is not affected in the external application.

## Delete a linked document or folder in Adobe Experience Manager

When you delete a linked document or folder from the external application, the document or folder remains in the Workfront system until you also delete it from Workfront.
