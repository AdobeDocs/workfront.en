# Remove links between Adobe Workfront and external document storage providers

When uploading a document from any service for the first time, Adobe Workfront requests permission from the user to access their document service. When the user provides their document service credentials to log in, the document service links itself to Workfront.

For information about linking external document services to Workfront, see [Linking Documents from External Applications](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

Since the document service is the one allowing permission to link to Workfront, it is not possible for Workfront&nbsp;to remove the permission granted by the document service. You must remove the permission from within the document service application or you must call our Support Team to remove this link from our servers.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p> Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront licenses*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
