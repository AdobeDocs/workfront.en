# Remove links between Adobe Workfront and external document storage providers

When uploading a document from any service for the first time, Adobe Workfront requests permission from the user to access their document service. When the user provides their document service credentials to log in, the document service links itself to Workfront.

For information about linking external document services to Workfront, see [Linking Documents from External Applications](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

Since the document service is the one allowing permission to link to Workfront, it is not possible for Workfront&nbsp;to remove the permission granted by the document service. You must remove the permission from within the document service application or you must call our Support Team to remove this link from our servers.
