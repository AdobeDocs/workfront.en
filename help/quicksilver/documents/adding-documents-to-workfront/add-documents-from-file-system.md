# Add documents to Adobe Workfront from your file system

You can add documents to projects, tasks, or issues in the following areas in Adobe Workfront:

* The global Documents area 
* The Documents area for a Workfront object

You can also upload new versions of documents and add links to documents from third-party cloud vendors, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive. For information about adding new versions of documents, see [Upload a new version of a document](../../documents/managing-documents/upload-new-document-version.md). For information about adding documents from third-party cloud vendors, see [Link documents from external applications](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

There are no restrictions on the types and sizes of files that you can upload to Workfront. However, in order to be successful, the upload must be completed within five minutes and you must have adequate storage space available.

If you need information about uploading new versions of a document to Workfront, see [Upload a new version of a document](../../documents/managing-documents/upload-new-document-version.md).

## Document security

The Workfront site prevents viruses and other malicious content from entering the site via documents&nbsp;in the following ways:

* [How Workfront detects corrupted files](#how-workfront-detects-corrupted-files) 
* [File name restrictions](#file-name-restrictions)

### How Workfront detects corrupted files {#how-workfront-detects-corrupted-files}

Workfront scans for viruses when a document is uploaded. If you attempt to upload a corrupted document, Workfront discontinues the upload process and a message appears&nbsp;indicating the file is corrupt. You also receive an email notification when Workfront detects potentially malicious content and the file is slated for removal.  
All corrupted files are removed within 24 hours of detection unless you remove it manually. If you delete a corrupted file, Workfront tracks this action as an update. If you allow Workfront to remove it, then no updates are recorded.

### File name restrictions {#file-name-restrictions}

Files that are uploaded to Workfront cannot contain certain characters in file names. If a file contains any of the following characters in the file name, the characters are removed from the file name when the file is uploaded: `< > { }`.
