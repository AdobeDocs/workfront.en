To send a document:

1. Go to the **Documents** area in Workfront, and select the document you want to send.
1. Click **Send to**, then choose the Experience Manager Assets integration your administrator set up.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Any name may be chosen for this integration, so it may not specifically mention Experience Manager Assets.
