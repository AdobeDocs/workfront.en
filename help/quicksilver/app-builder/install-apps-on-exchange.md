# Installing apps from Adobe Exchange

You can now install partner-built apps for Workfront directly from Adobe Exchange. This capability connects customers to a growing ecosystem of Adobe partners who deliver purpose-built tools that improve productivity, streamline operations, and extend Workfront functionality. Through Adobe Exchange, customers can discover and install apps that integrate seamlessly into Workfront using UI Extensions. 

Adobe Exchange is the central marketplace for third-party applications, extensions, and integrations across Adobe Experience Cloud—including Adobe Workfront. For Workfront customers, it's the go-to destination to discover and install apps that enhance functionality, streamline workflows, and integrate with external systems. 


## Adobe partner apps

At the heart of this innovation is the Workfront Partner Network, a growing ecosystem of technology partners—independent software vendors (ISVs) who build scalable, secure, and extensible apps using Adobe App Builder and Workfront UI Extensions. 

These partners use UI Extensions to embed their apps directly into the Workfront interface. Once installed from Adobe Exchange, Workfront administrators can add these apps to layout templates, making them visible and actionable within the Workfront experience. This seamless integration allows users to interact with partner-built tools—such as reporting utilities, automation widgets, or data connectors—without leaving Workfront. 

## Prerequisites and permissions

**App Builder Provisioning**
* Customers must have App Builder provisioned in their Adobe Admin Console. This is a prerequisite for installing apps from Exchange.


**Enterprise Org Admins or Developers**

* Can search for apps, click "Get," and proceed with installation. 

* If the app is already acquired by someone in the org, they may see "Begin Installation" or "Manage" instead  

**Non-Admin Users**

* May initiate acquisition but will be prompted to log in and may encounter restrictions if the app requires admin consent or licensing
