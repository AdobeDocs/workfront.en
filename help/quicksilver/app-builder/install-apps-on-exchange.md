# Installing apps from Adobe Exchange

You can now install partner-built apps for Workfront directly from Adobe Exchange. This capability connects customers to a growing ecosystem of Adobe partners who deliver purpose-built tools that improve productivity, streamline operations, and extend Workfront functionality. Through Adobe Exchange, customers can discover and install apps that integrate seamlessly into Workfront using UI Extensions. 

Adobe Exchange is the central marketplace for third-party applications, extensions, and integrations across Adobe Experience Cloud—including Adobe Workfront. For Workfront customers, it's the go-to destination to discover and install apps that enhance functionality, streamline workflows, and integrate with external systems. 


## Adobe partner apps

At the heart of this innovation is the Workfront Partner Network, a growing ecosystem of technology partners—independent software vendors (ISVs) who build scalable, secure, and extensible apps using Adobe App Builder and Workfront UI Extensions. 

These partners use UI Extensions to embed their apps directly into the Workfront interface. Once installed from Adobe Exchange, Workfront administrators can add these apps to layout templates, making them visible and actionable within the Workfront experience. This seamless integration allows users to interact with partner-built tools—such as reporting utilities, automation widgets, or data connectors—without leaving Workfront. 

## Prerequisites and permissions

**App Builder Provisioning**

* Customers must have App Builder provisioned in their Adobe Admin Console. This is a prerequisite for installing apps from Exchange.

**Enterprise Org Admins or Developers**

* Can search for apps, click "Get," and proceed with installation. 

* If the app is already acquired by someone in the org, they may see "Begin Installation" or "Manage" instead  

**Non-Admin Users**

* May initiate acquisition but will be prompted to log in and may encounter restrictions if the app requires admin consent or licensing 

## Aquire and install apps from Adobe Exchange

Adobe customers can browse, search, and install apps directly from the Adobe Exchange Marketplace to use with Workfront.  

Apps built with Adobe App Builder are listed as "App Builder Applications" on Adobe Exchange. Listings include documentation, screenshots, and usage instructions to help customers understand the app's value. 

To view apps for Workfront, navigate to Adobe Exchange and search for Workfront-compatible apps. Or, to filter listings for Workfront App Builder apps, click on Experience Cloud in the left-hand panel, Under Product, select Workfront, and under App Type, choose App Builder. 

### Acquire apps

At the top right of each app, there is a button for acquiring an app. Apps may require purchase from Adobe Exchange or allow installation but require licensing from the app developer. 

## Install apps

Once an app is acquired, it can be installed directly into Workfront. Administrators can manage installed apps through the Workfront interface, ensuring they are properly configured and accessible to users.
