# Subtabs replaced by new main areas or filters in the new Adobe Workfront experience

In the current version of Adobe Workfront, the multiple-level tabs make it sometimes difficult to find information and require time-consuming clicks.

Some of the former tabs have been removed and some of them have been moved to a simpler, less-intrusive left navigation panel for several areas and objects. The tabs and subtabs that we have removed have been replaced by either main areas in the Main Menu or by filters.

For information about tabs that moved to the new left navigation panel, see [Simplified left navigation in the new Adobe Workfront experience](../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/simplified-left-navigation.md).

## Benefits of removing tabs and subtabs

Consider the following benefits of removing subtabs:

* You can reach the information you need with fewer clicks.
* You can add new objects faster by accessing objects from the Main Menu and adding items in the respective lists.

  This is improved in the case of Programs, where you do not have to open a Portfolio before you can access or add Programs. Instead, you can access a list of Programs from the Main Menu.

* You can have a streamlined experience when viewing selective amounts of information throughout the new Adobe Workfront experience by using filters in all areas.

The tabs and subtabs that we have removed have been replaced by either main areas in the Main Menu or by filters.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Tabs moved to the Main Menu {#tabs-moved-to-the-main-menu}

The areas that you can access from the Main Menu in the new Adobe Workfront experience are dependent on:

* **Layout template configurations**: To learn how a Workfront administrator can modify the main menu from a layout template, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

* **License type**: To learn the default configurations for different license types, see [Understand the navigation for a Review-license user](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/reviewer-global-navigation-bar.md) or [Understand the navigation for a Work-license user](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/worker-global-navigation-bar.md).

* **User customization**: To learn how to change your own main menu configuration, see [Customize the Adobe Workfront navigation](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/customize-global-navigation-bar.md).

To learn more about an option in the Main Menu, see [Top navigation bar overview in the new Adobe Workfront experience](../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/global-navigation-overview.md).

To access the new areas in the new Adobe Workfront experience:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront.
1. Click an area to access a list of objects.

## Tabs and subtabs replaced by filters {#tabs-and-subtabs-replaced-by-filters}

Workfront currently displays lists of objects filtered by predefined criteria in subtabs under their parent object or under a specific area.

Because the subtab structure has been replaced in the new Adobe Workfront experience, you can display the same lists of objects under the same parent objects or areas by using predefined filters.

The information in the following subtabs is now available through filters:

* [Project lists under a Portfolio](#project-lists-under-a-portfolio) 
* [Portfolio lists under the Portfolio area](#portfolio-lists-under-the-portfolio-area) 
* [Issue lists under a project or task](#issue-lists-under-a-project-or-task)

### Project lists under a Portfolio {#project-lists-under-a-portfolio}

When accessing the Projects area, you can use the filter to display only projects that you own or projects you are part of.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Projects**.

   A list of projects displays.

1. From the **Filter** drop-down menu, select from the following built-in filters to display certain types of projects:

   <table> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">All</td> 
      <td>Displays all projects you have access to view.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Projects I'm On</td> 
      <td> <p>Displays projects for which you are part of the Project Team.</p> <p>For information about the Project Team, see the <a href="../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-team-overview.md" class="MCXref xref">Project Team overview</a> article.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Projects I Own</td> 
      <td>Displays projects for which you are designated as the Project Owner.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>
