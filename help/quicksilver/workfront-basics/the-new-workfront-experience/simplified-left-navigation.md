# Simplified left navigation in the new Adobe Workfront experience

In the current version of Adobe Workfront the multi-level tabs make it sometimes difficult to navigate and require time-consuming clicks.

We made several changes in the way information displays in the new Adobe Workfront experience. Some of the former tabs have been removed and some of them have been moved to a simpler, less-intrusive left navigation panel for several areas and objects.

For information about tabs that have been removed, see the article [Subtabs replaced by new main areas or filters in the new Adobe Workfront experience](../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/subtabs-removed.md).

## Benefits of the new left navigation

Consider the following benefits of the new left panel navigation:

* It is less intrusive and a better management of screen space.
* Your Workfront administrator can hide any section in the left panel except for the object's Details using Layout Templates.

  For information about using Layout Templates, see the article [Create and manage layout templates](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

* You can easily change the order of the sections in the left navigation without opening additional screens by dragging and dropping them in the order that you desire.

  For more information, see the following section in this article: [Use the new left navigation panel](#use-the-new-left-navigation-panel).

## Left navigation panel replaced most tabs

Currently, the information about an object displays in tabs under the object name in Workfront.

In the new Adobe Workfront experience, this information displays under sections listed in a navigation panel to the left of the object.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Default sections in the left navigation panel {#default-sections-in-the-left-navigation-panel}

You can access more information about objects or areas from the left panel for various objects or areas in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

The left panel is available for the following objects:

* Project
* Task
* Issue
* Portfolio
* Program
* Template
* User
* Team

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If the left panel displays only one section by default—such as **All Projects** in the **Projects** area—a Workfront administrator must add at least one custom section to this area when building a Layout Template and assign you to that template before the left panel displays in that area.  
>For information about how a Workfront administrator customizes the left panel in a Layout Template, see [Customize the left panel using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-left-panel.md).

Depending on the object or the area you've navigated to, the sections that appear in the left panel are different.
