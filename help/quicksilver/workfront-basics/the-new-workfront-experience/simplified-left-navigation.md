# Left navigation in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]

Most areas and objects in WF use a simple navigation panel on the left side of the screen. The following are benefits of left panel navigation:

* It allows better management of screen space.
* Your [!DNL Workfront] administrator can hide any section in the left panel except for the object's details using layout templates.

   For information about using layout templates, see the article [Create and manage layout templates](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

* You can easily change the order of the sections in the left navigation without opening additional screens by dragging and dropping them in the order that you desire.

   For more information, see the following section in this article: [Use the left navigation panel](#use-the-left-navigation-panel).

* You can customize the left panel by adding a dashboard.

## Access requirements
