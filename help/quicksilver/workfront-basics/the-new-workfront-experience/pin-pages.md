# Pin pages to customize your workspace

<!-- Audited: 4/2025 -->

You can pin your most important work in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for increased visibility, better organization, and quicker access. Pinned pages are always accessible from the top of any page in Workfront.

You might be assigned to a layout template that has pages already pinned (as described in [Customize pinned pages using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-pinned-pages.md)). These predefined pins cannot be renamed or removed. Any pages you pin display to the right of the predefined pins.
