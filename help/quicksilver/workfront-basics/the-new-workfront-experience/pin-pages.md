# Pin pages to customize your workspace

You can pin your most important work in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for increased visibility, better organization, and quicker access. Pinned pages are always accessible from the top of any page in Workfront.

You might be assigned to a layout template that has pages already pinned (as described in [Customize pinned pages using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-pinned-pages.md)). These predefined pins cannot be renamed or removed. Any pages you pin display to the right of the predefined pins.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Request] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Pin a page

1. Go to the page you want to pin.

   This can be any work item, such as a project, task, request queue, etc.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Pin current page]** at the top of the page.

   The pinned page is now accessible from the top of any page in [!DNL Workfront].

## Access a pinned page

1. At the top of any page, click the pinned page you want to view.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Hover over a pinned page to view the type of object (such as Project or Dashboard), the full name, and the description.

   Or

   If you have many pages pinned, you might need to click the **[!UICONTROL More] menu** ![](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png) to view additional pinned pages.

   The pinned page displays.

## Rename pinned pages

You can change the name of a pinned page to be more meaningful to you.

>[!NOTE]

>You can't rename pinned pages that are in the **[!UICONTROL More menu]** ![More menu](assets/more-icon-spectrum.png).

1. Hover over the pinned page in the top navigation.
1. Click the arrow next to the pin name and select **[!UICONTROL Rename pin]**.

   A small pop-up window appears for several seconds after you click the check mark or press Enter, allowing you to undo the pin name change before it is saved.

## Reorder pinned pages

You can rearrange the order that pinned pages appear.

1. Hover over the pinned page in the top navigation. When you see the hand cursor, then click and drag the pin to the desired order.

   >[!NOTE]
