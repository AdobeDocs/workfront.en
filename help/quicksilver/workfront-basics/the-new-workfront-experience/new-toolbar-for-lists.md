# Toolbar for lists in the new Adobe Workfront experience

The toolbar that displays above select lists in the new Adobe Workfront experience is designed with a modern look and feel that makes list management easier. The functionality is largely the same as what is available in Adobe Workfront Classic.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;filters, views, groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher permissions with access to share</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Benefits of the toolbar in the new Adobe Workfront experience

* Most drop-down menus, links, or toggles have been replaced by icons to make efficient use of the toolbar space and to provide a more consistent experience.
* A new icon for opening the Summary has been added to the toolbar. This gives you more control over when you want to display more information on tasks and issues or collaborate on them.
* Managing filters, views, and groupings has been standardized for all three elements to match one another. You can now remove or share a filter, view, or a grouping without first having to display it.

## Lists where the updated toolbar is available in the new Adobe Workfront experience

The updated toolbar is available in the following lists:

* Projects
* Tasks and subtasks
* Issues
* Portfolios
* Programs
* Groups (in the Setup area)
* Users
* Dashboards
* Templates

>[!TIP]

>The new toolbar is not available in all reports.

## Examples of a toolbar in Adobe Workfront Classic vs. the new Adobe Workfront experience

The icons you can find in an updated toolbar depend on the type of list that you view. The following are examples of the Adobe Workfront Classic and the new Adobe Workfront experience toolbars in a task list:

* [Task list toolbar in Adobe Workfront Classic](#task2) 
* [Task list toolbar in the new Adobe Workfront experience](#task3)

### Task list toolbar in Adobe Workfront Classic

In Adobe Workfront Classic, a combination of menus, icons, and links existed in the toolbar of a task list:

![](assets/qs-classic-toolbar-on-task-lists-350x25.png)

### Task list toolbar in the new Adobe Workfront experience

In the new Adobe Workfront experience, most menus and links have been replaced with icons, for a more streamlined and modern look:

## Manage Filters, Views, and Groupings from the new toolbar

Managing (creating, editing, or removing) a filter, view, or grouping has been updated in the new toolbar to give you a cohesive experience between these sets of list elements. Sharing or removing a filter, view, or grouping does not require applying it first anymore.

This experience is identical between managing a filter, a view, or a grouping.

For example, to manage a filter:

1. Go to a list of projects, tasks, issues, portfolios, or programs.
1. Find the `Filters` drop-down menu or the Filter icon ![](assets/qs-filter-in-new-toolbar-with-blue-dot---small.png) at the top of the list.

   If it has a blue dot in the upper-right corner, it indicates that a filter other than "All" is selected for the list.

   When viewing a list on a smaller screen, mouse over the Filter icon ![](assets/qs-filter-in-new-toolbar-with-blue-dot---small.png) to view the name of the filter currently applied to the list in the tooltip.

   ![](assets/qs-filter-in-new-toolbar-with-mouse-over-tooltip.png)

1. Click the name of the filter or click the Filter icon ![](assets/qs-filter-in-new-toolbar-with-blue-dot---small.png).

   The `Filters` box displays.

   ![](assets/qs-manage-filters-in-the-new-toolbar-350x306.png)

   A check mark appears to the left of a filter that is currently applied to the list.

1. In the filter box, do one of the following:

  * Click `New Filter` to add a new filter.

    The New Filter builder opens. For information about creating filters, see [Filters overview in Adobe Workfront](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/filters-overview.md).
  
  * Mouse over any of the filters listed and click the `Edit icon` ![](assets/edit-icon.png).

    The `Customize Filter` builder opens. Customizing filters is identical to creating them.
  
  * Mouse over any of the filters listed and click the `More menu` ![](assets/more-icon.png), then click  `Remove`.

    The filter is removed from the list.

    or

    Click `Share` and specify the names of the entities that you want to share the filter with, then click `Save`.

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >You cannot share or remove native Adobe Workfront filters or filters that you did not create yourself.
