# Prioritize important work items

You can use the My Focus column to prioritize your work. The My Focus column is a personal value and does not impact the priority set on the task or issue.

## Prioritize your work with the My Focus column

{{step1-to-priorities}}

1. Locate the work item that you want to focus on. 
1. In the **My Focus** column, choose one of the following focus levels:

    | Focus     | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | **Urgent**      |   Urgent is for work that requires immediate attention.  |
    | **Primary**  |   Primary is for work that you plan to focus on this week.         |
    | **Secondary**  |   Secondary is for work that you plan to move on to once your primary focus tasks are complete.         |
    | **Normal**    |  Normal is for work that does not need to be focused on yet.  Normal is the default for all tasks and issues.        |
