### Find your work with filters

Find your most important work with filters. You can use a natural language to find work with the Smart filter, or
You can use the Standard filter to find tasks and issues assigned to you:

<table>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
   <th>Filter</th>
   <th>Description</th>
   </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Working on</td>
      <td>Displays items that you are currently working on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ready to start</td>
      <td>Displays items with 
      <ul>
      <li>No incomplete predecessors or task constraints</li>
      <p>and</p>
      <li>The Planned Start Date is in the past or up to two weeks in the future</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Not ready</td>
      <td>Displays items that have
       <ul>
      <li>Incomplete predecessors or task constraints that prevent the item from being worked on</li>
      <p>or</p>
      <li>The Planned Start Date more than two weeks in the future</li>
      </ul>
       </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Requested</td>
      <td>Displays issues that you have not started work on</td>
    </tr>
      <td>Done</td>
      <td>Displays work completed within the last two weeks. This filter option does not include approvals.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Project</td>
    <td>Displays projects that contain tasks or issues you've been assigned to</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Due date</td>
    <td>Displays work by Planned Completion Date</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Status</td>
    <td>Displays tasks or issues in new, in progress, and complete statuses</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>My Focus</td>
    <td>Displays tasks or issues in that have assigned focus levels. Focus levels are assigned and managed by the individual user.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Organize your work with Groups

After you have filtered your work, you can group items based on

* My Focus
* Week due
* Status
* Project

For more information, see [Filter and group your work in Priorities](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/priorities/filter-group-work-priorities.md).

### Prioritize important work items with My Focus

My Focus is a column in the worklist that helps you to prioritize your work. The My Focus value is personal and does not impact project, task, or issue data. You can use the following focus levels:
 
* Urgent 
* High  
* Normal (default)
* Low

Once you have assigned focus levels to your work items, you can sort the column to surface urgent items at the top of your worklist.

For more information, see [Prioritize important work items](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/priorities/prioritize-work-items.md).

### Use the Calendar view

The Calendar view will provide a visual representation of your tasks and issues. You will be able to choose between a day, week, or month view. You will also be able to filter items in a similar way to the worklist.

## Work on tasks and issues

In Priorities, you can update work items to keep your work item details current, log time to track your work hours accurately, upload assets without having to navigate to a project, and add quick links for easy access to frequently used resources.

## Considerations

* Workfront Administrators cannot customize priorities through the Layout Template at this time.
* Accessing tasks in Priorities is across tabs. We plan to add additional tabs, like Documents, Subtasks, Approvals, etc, in the future. Let us know you need these items by submitting feedback using the **Give Feedback** button.
