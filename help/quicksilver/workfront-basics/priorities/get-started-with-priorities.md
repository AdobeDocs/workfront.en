# Get started with Priorities

Priorities can help you find and organize your work. 

## Find and organize your work

Tasks and issues assigned to you display in Priorities. 

### Find your work with filters

You can zero in on the work most important to you using filters. You can filter tasks and issues assigned to you in the following ways:

| Filter         | Description       |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Working on it  | Tasks and issues you are currently working on                  |
| Ready to start | Tasks that are ready for you to start                  |
| Not ready      | Tasks that are not ready for you to start                  |
| Done           | Tasks and issues marked Done                  |
| Project        | Projects that have been shared with you/you are assigned to?                  |
| Due date       | Task and issue planned completion date?                  |
| Status         | The status of the task or issue |
