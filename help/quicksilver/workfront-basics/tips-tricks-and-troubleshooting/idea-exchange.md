# The Innovation Lab

The [!UICONTROL Innovation Lab] enables authenticated users to submit, vote on, and discuss ideas with fellow customers.

As an authenticated user, you can:

* Submit product ideas
* Vote on as many ideas as you want. You can vote for or against each idea, but you can vote only once per idea. Be judicious and vote for the ideas you want to see gain traction!
* Prioritize ideas twice a year using the Leaderboard. You will be given 10 additional points to distribute across a curated list of top ideas put forth by the [!DNL Workfront] Product team.

To vote on an idea:

1. Log in to the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] Community on the [!DNL Adobe Experience League] site at the following URL:  [[!DNL Adobe Workfront] Community](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/workfront/ct-p/workfront).

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Ideas]** tab.

1. Search for the idea you would like to vote on.
1. Click on the idea.
1. Next to the idea's title are an up arrow and a down arrow. Clicking the up arrow allows you to vote on and distribute 10 points to the idea.

When an idea achieves a critical mass, the [!DNL Workfront] Product Management team actively reviews the suggested idea and communicates a decision about that idea within 3 to 4 weeks. The voting threshold that prompts [!DNL Workfront] to take action is 450 points. Over the coming years, [!DNL Workfront] will continue to periodically review and revise the threshold as the number of participants grows.

After an idea has been submitted, the idea defaults to the following status:

* **[!UICONTROL Seeking Votes]:** The idea has been submitted and is seeking votes. The more points the idea gets, the more likely it is to receive attention and/ or make the curated list.

After the critical threshold of 450 points is reached, the idea will have one of the following statuses:

* **[!UICONTROL Not Planned]:** The Product team has determined they will not create a solution.
* **On Roadmap:** [!DNL Workfront] plans to do this at some point in the future.
* **[!UICONTROL Prioritized]:** An idea that was added to the curated list and deemed a winning or top idea by the community. These ideas receive top priority and attention from the Product team.
* **[!UICONTROL Partial Delivery]:** Part of a solution has been created and delivered. Further updates will be provided.
* **[!UICONTROL Delivered]:** A solution has been created and delivered. No further updates will be provided and comments will be disabled.
* **[!UICONTROL Archived]**: Ideas that reach the 18-month-mark (from submission date) and have less than 300 points will be archived.
