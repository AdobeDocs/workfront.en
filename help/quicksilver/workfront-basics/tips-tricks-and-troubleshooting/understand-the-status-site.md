## Understand named vulnerabilities

### What is a named vulnerability? {#what-is-a-named-vulnerability}

In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce the stability, the security, or the integrity of a system.

Vulnerability researchers and exploit creators name their projects internally to make it easy to reference them (for example, [!DNL ShellShock], [!DNL Heartbleed], [!DNL POODLE], and [!DNL WannaCry]/[!DNL Petya]). When a vulnerability has wide-spread impact these names become public when the vulnerabilities are disclosed.
