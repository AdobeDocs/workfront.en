### What is a named vulnerability? {#what-is-a-named-vulnerability}

In&nbsp;computer&nbsp;security, a&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce the stability, the security, or the integrity of a system.

Vulnerability researchers and exploit creators name their projects internally to make it easy to reference them (for example, ShellShock, Heartbleed, POODLE, and WannaCry/Petya). When a vulnerability has wide-spread impact these names become public when the vulnerabilities are disclosed.

### How do I view named vulnerabilities identified by [!DNL Workfront?] {#how-do-i-view-named-vulnerabilities-identified-by-workfront}

1. Go to&nbsp; [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/), then click **Security**.

## Why is this important? {#why-is-this-important}

Any security-aware network administrators should be familiar with the Status site and the named vulnerabilities identified by Workfront.&nbsp;

When large impact vulnerabilities are disclosed it is imperative to ensure your vendors are aware and keep your data protected.

The Status site offers a current log of such vulnerabilities that you can reach at any time, where you can avoid the wait from logging a ticket or reaching out to your account manager to obtain this information.&nbsp; &nbsp;
