# View inherited permissions on objects

Your Adobe Workfront administrator can grant you access to view or edit objects when assigning your access level. For more information, see [Grant access to projects](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-projects.md).

Along with the access level that users are granted, you can also grant them permissions to specific objects that you have access to share. For more information about access levels and permissions, see [How access levels and permissions work together](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/how-access-levels-permissions-work-together.md).

Objects inherit permissions from parent objects in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront.

For information about the hierarchy of objects in Workfront, see [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md).

## View inherited permissions for an object

Viewing inherited permissions is identical for all objects.

To view inherited permissions for a project:

1. Go to a project whose sharing permissions you want to view. 
1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-icon.png), then click **Sharing**. 

1. Expand the **Inherited Permissions** list.

   This list displays the names of users that have access to either the portfolio or the program that the project belongs to and also have permissions to the project.

   ![](assets/remove-inherited-permissions-on-project-nwe-350x475.png)

1. (Optional) To remove inherited permissions from an object, see [Remove permissions from objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/remove-permissions-from-objects.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You must have Manage permissions on an object to remove the inherited permissions.
