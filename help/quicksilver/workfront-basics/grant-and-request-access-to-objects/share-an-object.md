# Share an object

<!--Audited: 01/2024-->

Your Adobe Workfront administrator grants users access to view or edit objects when they assign access levels. For more information about granting access to objects, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

Along with the access level that users are granted, you can also grant them permissions to view or edit specific objects that you created or have access to share. For more information about access levels and permissions, see [How access levels and permissions work together](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/how-access-levels-permissions-work-together.md).

Permissions are specific to one item in Workfront and define what actions one can take on that item.

For information about sharing permissions on objects, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>A Workfront administrator can add or remove permissions to any items in the system, for all users, without being the owner of those items.

* Projects, tasks, issues
* Portfolios, programs

   >If you have multiple entities named similarly, they are all listed under their type. The names of the entities appear in alphabetical order. However, the order in which the entity types appear is random.
   >
