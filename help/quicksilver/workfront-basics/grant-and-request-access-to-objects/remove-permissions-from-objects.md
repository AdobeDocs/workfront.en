# Remove permissions from objects

<!--Audited: 01/2024-->

You can remove other users' permissions on objects that you have access to Share. Removing permissions from objects is identical for all objects that can be shared.

Similar considerations as for sharing objects apply for removing permissions from objects. For more information, see the section [Considerations about sharing objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md#consider) in the article [Overview of sharing permissions on objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md)

## Access requirements

You must have the following to share objects:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>New  license: Contributor or higher</p>
   Or  
   <p>Current license: Request or higher</p>
   <p><b>NOTE</b></p>

   <p>Some objects require a higher access than Request. </p>
   
   <p>For example, for the new license, a Contributor can share issues, but only Standard-license users can share a project.</p>
   
   <p>For the current license, a Requestor can share issues, but only Workers or Planners can share a project.</p> 
   </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher to the objects you want to share</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions or higher to the objects you want to share</p> <p>Manage permissions to remove inherited permissions on objects</p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator. For more information, see [Access requirements for Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md). 

## Remove entities from the sharing list of an object {#remove-entities-from-the-sharing-list-of-an-object}

You can remove entities (users, job roles, teams, groups, companies) from the sharing list of an object. This removes their permissions to the object.

1. Go to the object you want to remove permissions from.

   For information about which objects can be shared, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

1. (Conditional) For programs, portfolios, and documents, do the following:
   
   1. Click the **More** icon ![more icon](assets/more-icon.png)next to the object name, then click **Sharing** or **Share.**

      ![share](assets/share-a-document-350x160.png)

   1. Click the **x** next to the name of a user, team, group, company, job role to remove them in the object access box.

      ![remove permission](assets/remove-permissions-on-portfolio.png)

   1. In the **< User Name >'s Workfront access will be removed from this** drop-down menu, select whether you want their access to be removed just from the object you have selected, or from all children objects associated with it. 

1. (Conditional) For projects, tasks, and issues, do the following:

   1. Click **Share** to the right of the object's name. 

      ![share](assets/new-share-button.png)
   1. Find the user, role, team, group, or company you want to remove from the object.
   1. Click **Remove**. 
   In the **Remove < User Name > from** drop-down menu, select whether you want their access to be removed just from the object you have selected, or from all children objects associated with it. 

      ![remove](assets/remove-permissions-on-project-nwe-350x479.png)

   The following scenarios exist:

      * If you remove the entity only from the object, that entity loses their permissions on the object, and their inherited permissions to the children objects. If they were previously granted permissions to the children items individually, they retain the same permissions on all children objects associated with it when you select this option.
      * If you remove the entity from the object and all the children objects, that entity loses their permissions to the object as well as all children objects, even when they were previously given individual permission on each child object.

1. Click **Save**.

## Remove permissions from several objects in bulk

You can remove entities (users, job roles, teams, groups, companies) from several objects at a time when you bulk select them in a list.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot view what access entities have for all the objects selected when you select them in bulk. You must know which entity you want to remove from the sharing of the objects selected before removing their permissions.

1. Go to the list of objects that you want to share.

   For information about which objects can be shared, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

1. Select several objects in the list, then click the **Share** icon ![share icon](assets/share-icon.png)at the top of the list. 
1. Type the name of the user, role, team, group, or company for which you want to remove the access in the **Edit `<Object Name>` access to** field. 
1. From the access drop-down menu, select **No Access**.

   ![remove in bulk](assets/no-access-option-removing-permissions-bulk-tasks-nwe-350x166.png)

1. In the `<User Name>`'s Workfront access will be removed from this drop-down menu, select whether you want their access to be removed just from the objects that you have selected, or from all other children objects associated with it.  
   The following scenarios exist:

   * If you remove the entity only from the object, that entity loses their permissions on the object, and their inherited permissions to the children objects. If they were previously granted permissions to the children items individually, they retain the same permissions on all children objects associated with it when you select this option.&nbsp;
   * If you remove the entity from the object and all the children objects, that entity loses their permissions to the object as well as all children objects, even when they were previously given individual permission on each child object.

   **Example:** Select whether to remove permissions to just the tasks you selected in a list, or to the issues and documents attached to the tasks as well.

   ![access](assets/remove-permissions-bulk-drop-down-for-attached-objects-nwe-350x96.png)

1. (Optional) To change permissions in bulk for several objects, select another level of sharing for the selected entity.

   For example, if they have Manage permissions, select Contribute or View instead. 

1. Click **Save**.

## Remove inherited permissions

Inherited permissions can be removed from objects allowing for owners to specifically&nbsp;identify who will get access to children objects regardless of the access of a user to a parent object.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Only users with Manage permission are able to remove inherited permissions.

To remove inherited permissions:

1. Go to an object to which you have Manage permissions. For example, go to a task.   
1. Go to the object access box as described in the [Remove entities from the sharing list of an object](#remove-entities-from-the-sharing-list-of-an-object) section in this article.
1. Select the **x**&nbsp;next to **Inherited Permission**&nbsp;on the sharing box to remove&nbsp;anyone listed there.

   ![inherited permissions](assets/remove-inherited-permissions-on-project-nwe-350x475.png)

   This ensures that no one who is granted permissions to the parent object (for example, the project) has permissions to this task by default. You must list&nbsp; individual entities in the sharing list of the task to grant permissions on the task.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You cannot remove individual entities from the Inherited Permissions list. You can only disable the Inherited Permissions for all entities listed.

1. Click **Save**.&nbsp;

## Make an object private

If you have shared an object system-wide, or you have shared it with external uses by making it public, you can make it private again by removing the system-wide or public permissions.&nbsp;

For more information about making an object available system-wide, or publicly, see [Share an object](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-an-object.md).

To make an object private:

1. Go to the object you want to make private.  
   For example, navigate to a report.
1. Click **Report Actions**, then **Sharing**.

   ![make private](assets/report-permissions-make-private-nwe-350x477.png)

1. Click **Remove public access** to remove the access of external users to viewing the report.
1. Click **Remove system-wide access** to stop sharing it with all Workfront users.&nbsp;
1. Click **Save**.
