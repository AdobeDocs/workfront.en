# Grant access to objects in the Home area

Users can request access to objects within Adobe Workfront. For more information about requesting access, see&nbsp; [Request access to objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md).

If you are the owner of an object, you can grant or deny access to items from your Home area.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Your Workfront administrator might make the following changes to the Home icon in your environment:
   >
   >* Replace it with an image customized to illustrate your organization. In this case, the icon will look different that shown in this article. 
   >* Replace the page linked to it with a different page. In this case, click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of the page, then click **Home**.
