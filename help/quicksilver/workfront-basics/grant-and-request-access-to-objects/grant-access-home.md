# Grant access to objects in the Home area

<!--Audited: 10/2024-->

Users can request access to objects within Adobe Workfront. 

For more information about requesting access, see  [Request access to objects](../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md).

If you are the owner of an object, you can grant or deny access to items from your Home area.
