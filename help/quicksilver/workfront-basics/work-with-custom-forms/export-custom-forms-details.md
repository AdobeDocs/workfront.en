   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The following scenarios may exist:
   >
   >   
   >   
   >   * When your group or Workfront administrator deselects all fields in the Overview area and the object has custom forms attached, the Overview section does not display.
   >   * When your group or Workfront administrator deselects all fields in the Overview area and the object has no custom forms attached, the Export drop-down menu is not visible.
   >   * When the object has no custom forms attached, you can export only the Overview area.
   >   * Custom fields that are behind logic and are not visible on the form do not export. For information about adding logic to a custom form, see [Add display logic and skip logic to a custom form](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/display-or-skip-logic-custom-form.md).

   * The name of the object the form is attached to
   * The name of the user who exported the PDF
   * The date and time when the PDF was produced
   * The name of the forms you exported
