# Adobe Workfront browser requirements

<!--Audited: 01/2024-->

Both Adobe Workfront and Workfront Proof require the use of an internet browser.

## Browsers Workfront supports

* **Web browser:** Workfront officially supports the current browser version and one previous version (and any previous version that constitutes at least five percent of total Workfront traffic) for the following browsers:

  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari
  * Microsoft Edge (Not Microsoft Edge Legacy)

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Workfront supports only the 100% zooming option for all supported browsers. This also includes the zoom settings in your computer's operating system.

## Browsers Workfront does not support

* **Internet Explorer 11** is no longer supported as of the 21.2 release (May 2021). 

* **Internat Explorer versions 7, 8, 9, and 10**: Microsoft discontinued all support (including severe security vulnerabilities) for IE 7 and IE 8 on January 12, 2016. In addition, IE 9 and IE 10 have also been discontinued in most circumstances. Microsoft's rationale behind this decision was based on the substantial security concerns with the architecture of these browsers that could severely impact users.

* **Browsers on a mobile device:** Workfront does not support any browsers on a mobile device. Instead, use the Workfront mobile apps, available for both iOS and Android.
