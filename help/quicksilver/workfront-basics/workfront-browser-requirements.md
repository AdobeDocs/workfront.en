# Adobe Workfront browser requirements

Both Adobe Workfront and Workfront Proof require the use of an internet browser.

## Browsers Workfront supports

* **Web browser:** Workfront officially supports the current browser version and one previous version (and any previous version that constitutes at least five percent of total Workfront traffic) for the following browsers:

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Workfront supports only the 100% zooming option for all supported browsers. This also includes the zoom settings in your computer's operating system.

  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari
  * Microsoft Edge (Not Microsoft Edge Legacy)


## Browsers Workfront does not support

* Firefox ESR
* Internet Explorer 11 is no longer supported as of the 21.2 release. Microsoft discontinued all support (including severe security vulnerabilities) for IE 7 and&nbsp;IE 8 on January 12, 2016. In addition, IE 9 and IE 10 have also been discontinued in most circumstances.&nbsp;Microsoft's rationale behind this decision was&nbsp;based on the substantial security concerns with the architecture of these browsers that could severely impact users.  
    >For more information, see the [Internet Explorer Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer)&nbsp;on the Microsoft Support site.
  
* **Browsers on a mobile device:** Workfront does not support any browsers on a mobile device. Instead, use the Workfront mobile apps, available for both iOS and Android.
