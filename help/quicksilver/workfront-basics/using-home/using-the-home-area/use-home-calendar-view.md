# Use the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This functionality was removed with the Legacy Home deprecation on 10/17/2014.

<!--

You can use the Calendar view in the [!UICONTROL Home] area to manage your work day and work assignments. Only you can view and manage your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar].

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Calendar] view in the [!UICONTROL Home] area is different from a [!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Calendar] report, which is a dynamic report that provides a visual representation of your work. For information about the [!DNL Workfront] [!UICONTROL Calendar] report, see [Calendar reports overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/calendar-reports-overview.md).

This problem will be fixed in the near future. (NOTE: From Alina: Spoke with Lisa and Court and they agreed to draft or delete this. Court could not remember what this was referring to and Lisa did not add this note. Lisa might update this if she hears from the team that this is still accurate.)</li>>

## Schedule work items in your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar]

You can use the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] to schedule work items for your week.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Placing a work item on your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] does not change the existing dates associated with the work item.

To add a [!DNL Workfront] work item to your calendar:

1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view, as explained in [View the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar]](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/view-home-calendar.md).

   All the work items assigned to you or your groups, teams, or job roles display in the left panel. You can sort the list and filter it to display only certain items.

   For more information, see [Filter and sort work items](#filter-and-sort-work-items) later in this article.

1. From the left panel, drag the work item to the day and time when you want to work on it.

   If you schedule yourself to work on an item after its planned completion date or for more time than the number of hours it's planned for, the work item displays in red and a warning appears.

   To learn about work item due dates and how they affect allocated time in the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar], see  [[!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/home-calendar-view.md).

1. Do any of the following:

   * **To schedule a work item for multiple days:** Repeat step 2 to add the item to each day and time when you want to work on it.
   * **To modify the duration of a calendar item:** Hover over the bottom edge of the item until the cursor becomes a double arrow, then drag the bottom edge to the ending time you want.
   * **To delete a calendar item:** Hover over the item, then click the [!UICONTROL trashcan] icon that is displayed.

## Update a work item on your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar]

You can make updates to work items that display in [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view. Your updates also appear on the [!UICONTROL Updates] tab of the actual work item.

1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view, as explained in [View the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar]](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/view-home-calendar.md).

1. Open the [!UICONTROL Details] panel for the work item you want to update:

   * From the left panel: Select the work item, then click **[!UICONTROL Details]**.
   * From the calendar: Click the scheduled calendar event.

   Details for the work item display in a panel that appears on the right of the window.

   ![](assets/click-cal-item-to-see-details-350x217.png)

1. Do any of the following to update the work item:

   * In the **[!UICONTROL Start a new update]** box, type your update, specify any of the following information, then click **[!UICONTROL Update]**.

      <table style="table-layout:auto">
      <col>
      <col>
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!UICONTROL Notify]</strong></td>
        <td><p> Tag users you want to notify about your update. For more information, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md" class="MCXref xref">Tag others on updates</a>.</p><p> </p></td>
       </tr>
       <tr data-mc-conditions="">
        <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!UICONTROL Commit Date]</strong></td>
        <td>In the drop-down calendar, select the date when you are committing to complete the work item. For information about setting the [!UICONTROL Commit Date], see <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/overview-of-commit-dates.md" class="MCXref xref">[!UICONTROL Commit Date] overview</a>.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr data-mc-conditions="">
        <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!UICONTROL How's this going?]</strong></td>
        <td>Select a new condition for the task or issue. For information about task and issue conditions, see <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/update-condition-for-tasks-and-issues.md" class="MCXref xref">Update Condition for tasks and issues</a>.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!UICONTROL Private to] my company</strong></td>
        <td>Disable to prevent users outside your company from being able to view this update.</td>
       </tr>
      </tbody>
     </table>

   * Click the current **[!UICONTROL Status]** for the item, then click a new status in the list that appears. For more information, see [Approval process overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approval-process-in-workfront.md).

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If you mark a work item assigned to you as [!UICONTROL Complete - Pending Approval], you may notice that it no longer appears on your calendar. This is because no further action is expected of you until the user who is set to approve the item marks it as [!UICONTROL Approved]. When this occurs, you will be able to see the item on your calendar as an [!UICONTROL Approved] item.

   * (Optional) To reply to an existing comment or update, click **[!UICONTROL Reply]**, specify any recipients in the **[!UICONTROL Notify]** box, type your reply, then click **[!UICONTROL Reply]**.\

      If you need information about specifying recipients, see [Tag others on updates](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md).

1. (Optional) To close the **[!UICONTROL Details]** panel, click anywhere outside it.
