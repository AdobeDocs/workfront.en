# Home area for Reviewers

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE:&nbsp;from&nbsp;Alina:&nbsp;not sure if we should still keep this one or not. In the past, Reviewers had a limited "Home" area which was their default page.&nbsp;Since now they created a "My Updates" area which is their new default, not sure if this makes much sense to still keep. The "My Updates" article is linked from this one, right at the top.)</p>
-->

Reviewers are assigned the My&nbsp;Updates area by default. They can access a modified version of the Home area only when an&nbsp;Adobe Workfront administrator adds the Home area to their layout template.

This article describes activities that you can perform in the Home area if you have a Review license.

For more information about the default navigation of Review-license users, see [Understand the navigation for a Review-license user](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/reviewer-global-navigation-bar.md). For more information about the My Updates area, see [Use the My Updates area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/my-updates-area.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>* General updates between users outside of an object are not enabled.
>* Although users with a Review license can be assigned tasks, they do not receive email or other notifications regarding assignments, and they cannot mark them as "Done."
