# [!UICONTROL Home] area for Reviewers

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This functionality was removed with the Legacy Home deprecation on 10/17/2014.

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: from Alina: not sure if we should still keep this one or not. In the past, Reviewers had a limited "Home" area which was their default page. Since now they created a "My Updates" area which is their new default, not sure if this makes much sense to still keep. The "My Updates" article is linked from this one, right at the top.)</p>


Reviewers are assigned the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area by default. They can access a modified version of the [!UICONTROL Home] area only when an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator adds the [!UICONTROL Home] area to their layout template.

This article describes activities that you can perform in the [!UICONTROL Home] area if you have a [!UICONTROL Review] license.

For more information about the default navigation of [!UICONTROL Review]-license users, see [Understand the navigation for a [!UICONTROL Review]-license user](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/reviewer-global-navigation-bar.md). For more information about the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area, see [Use the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/my-updates-area.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>* General updates between users outside of an object are not enabled.
>* Although users with a [!UICONTROL Review] license can be assigned tasks, they do not receive email or other notifications regarding assignments, and they cannot mark them as "[!UICONTROL Done]."
