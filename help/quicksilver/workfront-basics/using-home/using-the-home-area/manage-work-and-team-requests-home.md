# Manage work and team requests in the Home area

When work tasks and issues are assigned to you, they are listed on the [!UICONTROL Work List] in the [!UICONTROL Home] area. You can view, reassign, reply to, work on, or remove a request. Work requests in the [!UICONTROL Home] area are not limited to issues associated with request queues.

## View a work request

Work requests that are assigned to you are displayed in the left panel in [!UICONTROL Home]. You can configure which requests are displayed in Home using the filter at the top of the [!UICONTROL Work] List.

You can select filters that display items that are ready for you to work on, or items that you are currently working on already.

This article describes how to use the filters in the [!UICONTROL Home] area to view items that you are currently working on or might consider starting to work on. For information about all filters in the Home area, see [Display items in the Work List in the Home area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).

1. Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click **Home**.

   **[!UICONTROL Ready to Start]:** Displays only tasks and issues that are ready to start. Both of the following statements must be true:

   * The tasks and their parents have no predecessors or task constraints preventing them from being worked on.
   * The Planned Start Date of the tasks or issues is in the past or up to two weeks in the future.

   **Not Ready**: Displays only tasks and issues that are not yet ready to start. Either one of the following statements must be true:

   * The tasks and their parents might have predecessors or task constraints that prevent them from being worked on.
   * The tasks or issues have a Planned Start Date that is more than two weeks in the future.

## Work on a request

When you click the [!UICONTROL Work On It] button, you are indicating to the user who submitted the request and to any other user who might be assigned to the request that you are going to start working on the request. For more information about working on requests, see&nbsp; [Manage work and team requests](../../../people-teams-and-groups/work-with-team-requests/manage-work-and-team-requests.md).

1. Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click **Home**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Work List]** area, select the request you want to work on, then click **[!UICONTROL Work] On It**.\
   Information about the issue is displayed in the right panel.

## Remove a request

If you decide that you should not be working on the request, you can either convert the task or issue back to a request or remove it from your list.

1. Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click **Home**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Work List]**, point to the item waiting to be worked on.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Assignments]** widget and remove yourself. This removes the work item from your Work List. If the request is not assigned to anyone else or to another team or job role, the request is left unassigned.

   Or

   Click the **More** menu icon ![](assets/more-icon.png) to the right of the task or issue name in the Home Work List.

   ![](assets/more-menu-in-home-work-list-convert-to-request-remove-add-to-priority-options-nwe-350x160.png)

1. Select from the following options:

   * **Convert to work request:** Select this option to convert the work item back to a work request.\

      The work item is transitioned back to a request, and you remain assigned to the request.\
      You can accept the request at a later time by clicking **[!UICONTROL Work] on It** again.

   * **Remove:** Select this option to remove a request from your Work List.\

      You are unassigned from the request and the request is no longer associated with your name in Adobe Workfront.\
      If the request is not assigned to anyone else or to another team or job role, the request is left unassigned.
