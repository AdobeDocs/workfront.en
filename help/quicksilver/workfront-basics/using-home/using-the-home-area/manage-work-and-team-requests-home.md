# Manage work and team requests in the Home area

When work tasks and issues&nbsp;are assigned to you, they are listed on the Work List in the Home area. You can view, reassign, reply to, work on, or remove a request. Work requests in the Home area are not limited to issues associated with request queues.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col>

 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td>

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td>

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## View a work request

Work requests that are assigned to you are displayed in the left panel in Home. You can configure which requests are displayed in Home using the filter at the top of the Work List.

You can select filters that display items that are ready for you to work on, or items that you are currently working on already.

This article describes how to use the filters in the Home area to view items that you are currently working on or might consider starting to work on.&nbsp;For information about all filters in the Home area, see [Display items in the Work List in the Home area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).

1. Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click&nbsp;**Home**.
