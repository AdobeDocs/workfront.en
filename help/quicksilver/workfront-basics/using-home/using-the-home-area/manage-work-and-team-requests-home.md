## View a work request

Work requests that are assigned to you are displayed in the left panel in [!UICONTROL Home]. You can configure which requests are displayed in [!UICONTROL Home] using the filter at the top of the [!UICONTROL Work List].

You can select filters that display items that are ready for you to work on, or items that you are currently working on already.

This article describes how to use the filters in the [!UICONTROL Home] area to view items that you are currently working on or might consider starting to work on. For information about all filters in the [!UICONTROL Home] area, see [Display items in the Work List in the [!UICONTROL Home] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).
