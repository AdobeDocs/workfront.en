   >[!TIP]
   >
   >* Filter options are based on objects (Tasks, Issues, Approvals, Personal tasks).
   >* Tasks and issues are further filtered by their state in relationship with our readiness to work on them ([!UICONTROL Working On], [!UICONTROL Ready to Start], [!UICONTROL Not Ready] for tasks, and [!UICONTROL Working On] and [!UICONTROL Requested] for issues). You can select to display tasks or issues in a specific state or click Tasks or Issues to select and display all states.
   >* There is a separate filter for completed items and it includes both tasks and issues. This does not include approvals. The [!UICONTROL Completed] filter includes Personal tasks.
   >* You can select to display only one state at a time. For example, you can display only [!UICONTROL Working On] tasks and only [!UICONTROL Requested] issues. You can also select multiple states at a time.
   >* You cannot apply filters for items assigned to one of your teams, and team assignments are not included in the items that are assigned directly to you.

You can group and sort the [!UICONTROL Work List] by [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date], [!UICONTROL Commit Date], [!UICONTROL Project], or [!UICONTROL My Priority]. The option you choose determines how items are grouped in the [!UICONTROL Work List].

## Search the [!UICONTROL Work List]

When you search the [!UICONTROL Work List], any items assigned to you are returned in the search (even items that are not currently loaded on the screen). If the [!UICONTROL Show complete] option is selected, any items you marked complete within the past two weeks are also returned.

In addition, only the names of the work items are searched (information within the work item are not searched, nor are the names of the projects where the work item resides).

1. (Optional) If you are searching for a work item that is already complete, you must configure the [!UICONTROL Work List] to display completed items before searching.

1. Click the Search icon ![Search](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/assets/search-icon.png). 
1. Begin typing the name of the item name you are searching for.\
   The [!UICONTROL Work List] is automatically filtered as to include items with a matching name.

## Change the size of the Work List

You can change the size of the [!UICONTROL Work List] so that it consumes anywhere between about a quarter of the Home area to about half of the [!UICONTROL Home] area.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Home]**.

You can collapse and expand groupings within the [!UICONTROL Work List] to better control what information is visible.\
By default, the [!UICONTROL This Week] grouping is expanded and all other groupings are collapsed. Any changes you make are remembered the next time you access the Home area.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Home]**.
