## Add a widget to Home

Widgets are the foundation of Home. By adding widgets to your Home page, you can choose the type of information that displays to best meet your work needs. Some widgets are only available to specific license types, as the objects they track are only available to those licenses. For more information, see the [Widgets available for specific license types](#widgets-available-for-specific-license-types) section above. 

To add a widget:

1. Navigate to your Home page, either by clicking on the Adobe Workfront icon ![Adobe Workfront Icon](assets/home-icon-30x29.png) at the top of your screen if Home is set as your landing page, or by clicking on the main menu icon ![Main Menu Icon](assets/main-menu-icon.png) then clicking on **Home**.

1. Click **Customize** at the upper-right corner of the screen.

    * **My Work**\
        A great place to start for managing a variety of work, this widget displays all of your assigned tasks, issues, and requests in one place. You can click the Work On It button to start working on an item, or the Done button to mark them complete. You can also update information (Status, Condition, Percent Complete) about tasks and issues, log time, and add updates from the My Work widget. 

    * **Boards**\
        Displays any boards you have created or have been invited to use. You can also create a new board based on the following templates: Basic board, Kanban board, Retrospective board, Dynamic board

    * **My projects**\
        Displays projects you own or projects you are on in a list. You can use  existing filters, views, or groupings to customize the list, or you can create a project directly from the widget.

    * **My tasks**\
        Displays tasks that are assigned to you in a list. You can use  existing filters, views, or groupings to customize the list, or you can create a task directly from the widget. You can also delegate your tasks while you are away from the office. 

    * **My issues**\
        Displays issues that are assigned to you in a list. You can use existing filters, views, or groupings to customize the list, or you can create an issue directly from the widget.

    * **My requests**\
        Displays all requests you have submitted, a filter to only display open requests, and a button that opens the summary panel for a request.

    * **Team requests**\

    * **Mentions**\
        Displays recent comment threads from across Workfront, similar to the My Updates page. You can use the reply button to compose a reply within the widget. This widget also shows comments made on tasks and issues that you are assigned to, that you assigned to another user, that you own, that you are primary contact on, or that you createdâ€”as long as the task or issue has been updated in the last 30 days.

    * **To-dos**\
        This unique widget allows you to add items to a personal checklist that you can freely edit. To-dos are tracked as tasks in your personal project, and remain for up to two weeks after completion.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >You must have permission to create tasks in order to create to-dos in the To-dos widget, and only personal tasks that are entered by the current user will appear in the widget.
