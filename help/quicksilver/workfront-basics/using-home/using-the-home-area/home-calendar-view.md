You can use it to schedule when you want to do your work. And you can integrate it with outside calendars such as a [!UICONTROL Microsoft Outlook] calendar.

Depending on the item, the following information might display on the left of the calendar, for the item that you select in the work list:

* **[!UICONTROL Planned]**: Displays the hours a resource manager has allocated for work to be completed on the item. To learn more about planned hours, see [Planned Hours overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/planned-hours.md).

## Allocation bar

When you set up your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar], you specify the number of hours you typically work in a week (see [Configure your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view settings](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/configure-home-calendar-view.md)). [!DNL Adobe Workfront] uses this number to determine your total allocable work hours. 

The [!UICONTROL Allocation] bar is a visual representation of the number of hours in your work week and how you are using them.

![](assets/allocation-bar-qs-350x181.png)

The colors in the [!UICONTROL Allocation] bar indicate the following information:

* **Grey**: Number of hours scheduled for events from integrated calendars. For more information about integrating calendars, see the section [Configure your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view settings](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/configure-home-calendar-view.md#configuring-your-home-calendar-view) in [Configure your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view settings](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/configure-home-calendar-view.md).

* **Blue**: Number of hours you have scheduled for [!DNL Workfront] work items assigned to you. You can schedule work by dragging items from the [!UICONTROL Work List] and dropping them into your calendar. For more information about scheduling work, see the [Schedule work items in your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar]](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-home-calendar-view.md#scheduling-work-items-in-home-calendar) section in [Use the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-home-calendar-view.md).

* **Light Blue**: The number of free hours available for allocation.
* **Red**(not shown above): Scheduled events and work items that have exceeded the number of hours you have available for the week.

## [!UICONTROL Due] bar

The [!UICONTROL Due] bar on your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] displays the items that are due for the week currently displayed, according to their [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date].
