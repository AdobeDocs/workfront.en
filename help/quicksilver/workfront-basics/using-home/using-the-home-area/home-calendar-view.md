The [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view in the [!UICONTROL Home] area allows you to view and manage your work week and work assignments on a personal work calendar visible only to you. You can use it to schedule when you want to do your work. And you can integrate it with outside calendars such as a [!UICONTROL Microsoft Outlook] calendar.

You can drag your work items from the [!UICONTROL work list] to your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] to schedule when you want to work on them.

Depending on the item, the following information might display on the left of the calendar, for the item that you select in the work list:

* **[!UICONTROL Planned]**: Displays the hours a resource manager has allocated for work to be completed on the item. To learn more about planned hours, see [Planned Hours overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/planned-hours.md).

## Allocation bar

When you set up your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar], you specify the number of hours you typically work in a week (see [Configure your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view settings](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/configure-home-calendar-view.md)). [!DNL Adobe Workfront] uses this number to determine your total allocable work hours. 

The [!UICONTROL Allocation] bar is a visual representation of the number of hours in your work week and how you are using them.

![](assets/allocation-bar-qs-350x181.png)

The colors in the [!UICONTROL Allocation] bar indicate the following information:

* **Grey**: Number of hours scheduled for events from integrated calendars. For more information about integrating calendars, see the section [Configure your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view settings](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/configure-home-calendar-view.md#configuring-your-home-calendar-view) in [Configure your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view settings](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/configure-home-calendar-view.md).

* **Blue**: Number of hours you have scheduled for [!DNL Workfront] work items assigned to you. You can schedule work by dragging items from the [!UICONTROL Work List] and dropping them into your calendar. For more information about scheduling work, see the [Schedule work items in your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar]](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-home-calendar-view.md#scheduling-work-items-in-home-calendar) section in [Use the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-home-calendar-view.md).

* **Light Blue**: The number of free hours available for allocation.
* **Red**(not shown above): Scheduled events and work items that have exceeded the number of hours you have available for the week.

## [!UICONTROL Due] bar

The [!UICONTROL Due] bar on your [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] displays the items that are due for the week currently displayed, according to their [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date].
