# Create and manage personal to-do item

You can create a personal to-do item in the To-dos widget in the [!UICONTROL Home] area. The to-do items are personal tasks that you create for yourself. 

You and other users can view your personal tasks in a personal task report. From there, they can add them to projects, if needed. 

>[!TIP]
>
>Work items that you send to other users or to yourself from the user profile page also display in the To-dos widget in the Home area of the user. For information, see [Create personal tasks](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/create-personal-tasks.md).
