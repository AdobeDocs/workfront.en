# Use the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area


You can use the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area to quickly review the approvals waiting for your decision or the conversations you have been included in.

As a user with a [!UICONTROL Review] license, you can find the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area in the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] by default and the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area is the default landing page for you.

For information about [!DNL Adobe Workfront] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront] licenses overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md).

If you have a license type different than Review, the [!DNL Workfront] or Group administrator must add the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area to your layout template to display it in the Main Menu. For information, see [Customize the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).
