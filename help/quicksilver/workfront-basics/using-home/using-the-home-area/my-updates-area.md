# Use the My Updates area

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: there is a similar article like this in the "My&nbsp;Work" folder that is conditioned for Classic only)</p>
-->

You can use the My Updates area to quickly review the approvals waiting for your decision or the conversations you have been included in.

As a user with a Review license, you can find the My Updates area in the Main Menu by default and the My Updates area is the default landing page for you.

For information about Adobe Workfront licenses, see [Adobe Workfront licenses overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md).

If you have a license type different than Review, the Workfront or Group administrator must add the My Updates area to your layout template to display it in the Main Menu. For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher to any objects for which you are tagged in a conversation or need to resolve an approval (Projects,&nbsp;Tasks, Issues,&nbsp;Documents)</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions or higher to projects, tasks, issues, documents where you are tagged in a conversation or need to resolve an approval</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you begin:

* If you have a Workfront license other than Review, your Workfront or Group administrator must add the My&nbsp;Updates area to the Main&nbsp;Menu using a layout template and assign you to that template.

  Review-license users can view the My Updates area in their Main Menu by default.

## Access the My Updates area

1. Click **My Updates** in the **Main Menu**.
