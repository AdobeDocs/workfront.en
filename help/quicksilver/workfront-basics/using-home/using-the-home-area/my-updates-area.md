# Use the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: there is a similar article like this in the "My Work" folder that is conditioned for Classic only)</p>
-->

You can use the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area to quickly review the approvals waiting for your decision or the conversations you have been included in.

As a user with a [!UICONTROL Review] license, you can find the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area in the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] by default and the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area is the default landing page for you.

For information about [!DNL Adobe Workfront] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront] licenses overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md).

If you have a license type different than Review, the [!DNL Workfront] or Group administrator must add the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area to your layout template to display it in the Main Menu. For information, see [Customize the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront plan]</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>New: Contributor or higher</p>
   Or   
   <p>Current: [!UICONTROL Request] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configuration</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher to any objects for which you are tagged in a conversation or need to resolve an approval (Projects, Tasks, Issues, Documents)</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Object permissions</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL View] permissions or higher to projects, tasks, issues, documents where you are tagged in a conversation or need to resolve an approval</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you begin:

* If you have a [!DNL Workfront] license other than [!UICONTROL Review], your [!DNL Workfront] or Group administrator must add the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area to the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] using a layout template and assign you to that template.

* Review-license users can view the [!UICONTROL My Updates] area in their [!UICONTROL Main Menu] by default.
