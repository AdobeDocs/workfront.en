>[!IMPORTANT]

>Content in this article was replaced with content from the Get started with new Home article. New Home will now be referred to as Home. 

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment for all customers. After the monthly releases to Production, the same features are also available in the Production environment for customers who enabled fast releases. </span> 

The new Home experience in Adobe Workfront aims to improve the current Home experience while providing a more flexible way for you to focus on the right work.

The new Home is a powerful new feature for managing your work. You can customize this flexible space to highlight the work that is most important to you and streamline your task, issue, request, and approval management.

## Customize the new Home

The new Home is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to select the widgets that track your most important work, filter the scope of that work based on when it's due, and even add a splash of color.

### Widgets

Widgets are the foundation of the new Home. By adding widgets to your Home page, you can choose the type of information that displays to best meet your work needs. Some widgets are only available to specific license types, as the objects they track are only available to those licenses. 

For information on adding, moving, resizing, or deleting widgets, see [Add, edit, or remove widgets in New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/add-edit-remove-widgets-in-new-home.md).

Below are the 11 widgets currently available to choose from, as well as a summary of the information they display:

* **My Work**\
    A great place to start for managing a variety of work, this widget displays all of your assigned tasks, issues, and requests in one place. You can click the Work On It button to start working on an item, or the Done button to mark them complete. You can also update information (Status, Condition, Percent Complete) about tasks and issues, log time, and add updates from the My Work widget. 

* **Boards**\
    Displays any boards you have created or have been invited to use. You can also create a new board based on the following templates: Basic board, Kanban board, Retrospective board, Dynamic board

* **My projects**\
    Displays projects you own or projects you are on in a list. You can use  existing filters, views, or groupings to customize the list, or you can create a project directly from the widget.

* **My tasks**\
    Displays tasks that are assigned to you in a list. You can use  existing filters, views, or groupings to customize the list, or you can create a task directly from the widget. You can also delegate your tasks while you are away from the office. 

* **My issues**\
    Displays issues that are assigned to you in a list. You can use existing filters, views, or groupings to customize the list, or you can create an issue directly from the widget. This widget only includes issues whose associated projects are set to Current and doesn't include completed projects. You can also delegate your issues while you are away from the office. 

* **My requests**\
    Displays all requests you have submitted, a filter to only display open requests, and a button that opens the summary panel for a request.

    <span class="preview">In the Preview environment, this widget displays all requests you have submitted, a filter to display only requests that meet criteria you specify, and a button that allows you to rearrange the columns in the widget. If you have access to Workfront Planning, your Planning requests also appear here.</span>


* **Team requests**\
    Displays all pending requests for teams that you are on sorted by team, as well as buttons to directly assign a request to a user or to work on it yourself.

* **My approval**\
    Displays all of your pending, assigned, delegated, and submitted approvals; a button to delegate approvals; and buttons to make approval decisions directly within the widget.

* **Document approval metrics**\
        Displays 2 charts with information about average docment approval time and decisions as well as list views of pending and overdue approvals. You must have [Unified Approvals](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/document-approvals-overview.md) enabled to use this widget.

* **Mentions**\
    Displays recent comment threads from across Workfront, similar to the My Updates page. You can use the reply button to compose a reply within the widget. This widget also shows comments made on tasks and issues that you are assigned to, that you assigned to another user, that you own, that you are primary contact on, or that you createdâ€”as long as the task or issue has been updated in the last 30 days.

* **To-dos**\
    This unique widget allows you to add items to a personal checklist that you can freely edit. To-dos are tracked as tasks in your personal project, and remain for up to two weeks after completion.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You must have permission to create tasks in order to create to-dos in the To-dos widget, and only personal tasks that are entered by the current user will appear in the widget.
