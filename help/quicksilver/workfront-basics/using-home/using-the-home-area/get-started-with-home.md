# Get started with [!UICONTROL Home]

This article describes an overview of the current [!UICONTROL Home] area in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]. For information about working in the new [!UICONTROL Home], see [Get started with New Home in Adobe Workfront](../new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

There are two ways to view your work in the current [!UICONTROL Home] area:

* From the [!UICONTROL Work List] 
* From the [!UICONTROL Calendar].

## Work List

You can view all of your assigned work in one place, in the [!UICONTROL Work List]:

![[!UICONTROL Work List] panels](assets/worklist-and-right-panel-home.png)

Review the following sections in the current [!UICONTROL Home] area, as highlighted in the above image: 

* **A**: Use the left panel to filter, sort, and select work assigned to you.

* **B**: After selecting a work item in the left panel, use the right panel to interact with custom fields, make updates, and log time.

For more information about using the [!UICONTROL Home Work List], see the following articles:

* [Display items in the [!UICONTROL Work List] in the [!UICONTROL Home] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md)
* [Create work items from the [!UICONTROL Home] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/create-work-items-in-home.md)

## Calendar

You can visualize your work by displaying when work items are due and you can block out time to complete them, by reviewing your work in the [!UICONTROL Calendar] in the [!UICONTROL Home] area: 

![](assets/calendar-home-nwe-350x114.png)

Review the following sections in the current [!UICONTROL Home] area, as highlighted in the above image: 

* **A**: Use the [!UICONTROL Calendar] view to create a visual map of the work you need to complete. Simply click and drag work items from the [!UICONTROL Work List] on to the [!UICONTROL Calendar] to block out time to work.

* **B**: Use the [!UICONTROL Calendar]'s sync option to sync with your [!DNL Outlook] calendar. Manage meetings and work all in one place.

* **C**: Use the [!UICONTROL Details] button to open a new right panel where you can view more information about the work item.

* **D**: Use the due bar to keep track of when work assigned to you is due.

For more information on how to use the Home Calendar, see [Use the [!UICONTROL Home Calendar] view](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-home-calendar-view.md).

## Find your work

The [!UICONTROL Home] area is your one-stop shop to find tasks, issues, and approvals assigned to you. The filter and sort options built into the [!UICONTROL Home] area work together to support you in working the way you want. You can use the [!UICONTROL Sort by] option to group items together and then use the Filter to focus in on work that needs to be completed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The filter and sort options are stored in the browser. If you consistently use the same browser on the same computer (and do not clear the site data) the filters and sorting will not change, but if you switch browsers or computers then the filters and sorting will be different.

### Group similar work items together with the '[!UICONTROL Group by]' option

The [!UICONTROL Sort by] option allows you to group like items in the Work List. You can sort by:

* [!UICONTROL Planned Completion]
* [!UICONTROL Planned Start]
* [!UICONTROL Commit Date]
* [!UICONTROL Project]
* [!UICONTROL My Priority]

For more information on how to use groupings, see [Display items in the [!UICONTROL Work List] in the [!UICONTROL Home] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).

### Narrow your focus with filters

The [!UICONTROL Work List] Filter allows you to narrow your focus to specific work items.

The following are examples of how you can filter items you view in Home: 

* Filter by item type and state.

   For example, if you want to display all the tasks, you can select the [!UICONTROL Tasks] filter. If you want to be more specific than this and display only tasks that are ready for you to start working on, then select the [!UICONTROL Ready to Start] filters under the [!UICONTROL Tasks] filter.

* Filter by item type only.

   For example, you can select [!UICONTROL Issues] to see all issues in all states ([!UICONTROL Working On] or [!UICONTROL Requested]), or [!UICONTROL Approvals] to see all work item, request for access, timesheet, document, and proof approvals.

* Filter by status only.

   For example, you can select the [!UICONTROL Completed] filter to display tasks and issues that have been completed. This includes Personal tasks but it does not include approvals.

For more information on how to use filters, see [Display items in the [!UICONTROL Work List] in the [!UICONTROL Home] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).

![](assets/displaying-work-items-filters-nwe-350x401.png)

### Access work assigned to your team

The [!UICONTROL Home] area has a permanent grouping dedicated to team requests with a direct link to the team's request page. Use this grouping to view and access requests for any of the teams you're on.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Filter] and [!UICONTROL Sort by] options do not affect the [!UICONTROL Team Requests] grouping. This grouping is visible as long as you have work assigned to your team.

For more information on accessing team requests, see the article [[!UICONTROL Manage] work and team requests in the [!UICONTROL Home] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/manage-work-and-team-requests-home.md).

![](assets/team-requests-expanded-home-group-by-drop-down-nwe-350x314.png)

### Monitor work that you submitted

Keep track of work that you submitted for approval directly from [!UICONTROL Work List]. You can remind the approver about the work that needs approval. You can also recall the approval if needed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Filter] and [!UICONTROL Sort by] options do not affect the [!UICONTROL Approvals I've Submitted] grouping. This grouping is visible as long as you have work waiting for approval.

## Prioritize what's important to you

The [!UICONTROL Work List] allows you to surface and prioritize work that is important to you with the [!UICONTROL My Priority Sort by] option. You can add up to 20 items to your [!UICONTROL My Priority] list. Use the [!UICONTROL More] menu to add work items to your priority list. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any work items added to [!UICONTROL My Priority] are visible only to you, and no one can prioritize work for you.

For more information on how to use [!UICONTROL My Priority], see [Prioritize work in the [!UICONTROL Home] area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/prioritize-work-in-home.md).

## Get it done

Use the right panel in [!UICONTROL Home] to update and complete your work.

### Work in a space customized for you

Your [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator can add up to 16 custom fields to make it easier to find and update the information you need. Most of the fields are editable, so you don't have to navigate to into the work item.

To update any of the fields in this area, simply click on the field.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can't update the [!UICONTROL Commit Date] in this area.

![](assets/16-fields-home-350x137.png)

### Update coworkers with important information

Communicate quickly and efficiently with coworkers from the [!UICONTROL Home] area. You ask coworkers questions, notify them of recent updates, or reply to direct comments. In addition, you can update others on the progress you're making by:

* Updating the [!UICONTROL Commit Date]

   <!--
  <note type="note">
  This is the only place you can update the Commit Date in Home.
  <br>
  </note>
  -->

* Reporting on how you feel things are going
* Updating the percent complete bar

For more information on communicating in the [!UICONTROL Home] area, see [Update work](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).

![](assets/updates-home-350x198.png)

### Log your time

Keep track of the hours you've worked on individual work items. You can choose a general hour type, such as [!UICONTROL Task Time], or you can choose a project-specific hour type set up by your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

For more information on how to log time in the [!UICONTROL Home] area, see the section [Home](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/log-time.md#home) in the article [Log time](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/log-time.md).
