Home helps you manage your work. You can customize this flexible space to highlight the work that is most important to you and streamline your task, issue, request, and approval management.

## Customize Home

Home is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to select the widgets that track your most important work, filter the scope of that work based on when it's due, and even add a splash of color.

## Add Widgets

Widgets are the foundation of the new Home. By adding widgets to your Home page, you can choose the type of information that displays to best meet your work needs. Some widgets are only available to specific license types, as the objects they track are only available to those licenses. 

For information on adding, moving, resizing, or deleting widgets, see [Add, edit, or remove widgets in Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/add-edit-remove-widgets-in-new-home.md).

### Background customization

You can add a bit of personal flare to your Home page by selecting a colorful banner for the top of the page.

**To change the color of your Home background:**

1. Go to your Home page, by doing one of the following: 

    * If Home is set as your landing page, click the **Adobe Workfront** icon ![Adobe Workfront Icon](../new-home/assets/home-icon-30x29.png) in the upper-left corner of your screen.
    * Click the **Main Menu** icon in the upper-right corner of the screen, or the **Main Menu** icon ![Main Menu Icon](../new-home/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, if available, then click **Home**.

1. Click **Customize** at the upper-right corner of the screen.

    The Customize panel opens.
