## Find your work with filters

You can fine-tune the My Work filters to focus on specific items in your list of work:

### Filter details

| Filter         | Details       |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Working on   |     Displays items that you are currently working on              |
| Ready to start |  Displays items with no incomplete predecessors or task constraints  and the Planned Start Date is in the past or up to two weeks in the future                  |
| Not ready      | Displays items that have incomplete predecessors or task constraints that prevent the item from being worked on or the Planned start date is more than two weeks in the                  |
| Requested           |  Displays issues that you have not started work on                |
| Delegated by me       | Displays items that you have delegated to other users                 |
| Delegated to me       |  Displays items users have delegated to you                |
| Completed         | Displays work completed within the last two weeks. This filter option does not include approvals.                  |

>[!TIP]

>If you are looking for more specific filtering options, you can use the My Task or My Issue widgets. 

## Sort and group your work

You can use the My Work widget's sorting and grouping features to organize your work.

### Sort

Sorting can help you organize your work in a way that makes sense to you. You can sort the work list by Due Date, Name, Percent Complete, and Status. 

Past-due items display a warning icon next to the date. Workfront uses the Planned Completion Date to determine if tasks and issues are past due.

>[!TIP]
>
>To create a list that displays all past-due items at the top of the My Work widget, sort by Due Date and do not apply a group.

### Group

Grouping can help you further organize your work list. You can group the work list by Project, Status, Due Date, or Nothing. 

Due date - planned completion 

When you apply a grouping, what you select in the sort sorts within the grouping

## View approvals and team requests

Approvals and team requests do not display in the My Work widget. If you regularly work with approvals and team requests, we recommend you add the following widgets to your New Home page:

* Awaiting my approval
* All approvals
* Team requests 

For information about adding widgets to your New Home page, see [Customize New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).
