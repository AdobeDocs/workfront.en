## Work list

### Organize work with the My Work widget

The My Work widget was created as closely to the Legacy Home Work list as possible. Users can group and filter their Work list in the My Work widget with similar filters and groupings: 

| **Filter** | **Group** |
|------------|-----------|
| - Working on <br> - Ready to start <br> - Not ready <br> - Requested <br> - Delegated <br> - Completed | - Project <br> - Status  <br> - Due Date |


**Legacy Home groupings not available in New Home**

* Planned Completion Date - Renamed to Due Date in New Home
* Planned start 
* Commit Date 
* My Priority 

### Delegate work

Users can still delegate work from New Home in the following widgets:

* My Work
* My Tasks
* My Issues
* Awaiting My Approvals

Users can find work delegated to the in the following widgets:

* My Work widget using the Delegated to me filter
* Awaiting my Approvals using the Delegated approvals filter

### Use the calendar view

The calendar view is no longer available in New Home; however, a calendar replacement is on the roadmap for Priorities. 

### Create a personal task

Users can no longer create a personal task the same way they did in Legacy Home. Instead, users can create To-do items. 

### View approvals I've submitted

Users can't view approvals they have submitted. If users in your organization need this functionality, please upvote or post a comment here in the following Community posts:

### Add items to My Priority

Users no long have access to a My Priority feature in New Home. We are introducing a new My Focus column with Priorities that will replace this. 

Users can use the Boards widget to track high priority items if desired. 

## Update work items

In Legacy home, users could use the right panel to update their work. In New Home, users now use the Summary panel to update work. This is the same Summary panel available in Projects, Tasks, Issues, and Documents.

Workfront administrators can customize which fields appear in the Summary in the Layout template. For more information, see [Customize Home and Summary using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-home-summary-layout-template.md).
