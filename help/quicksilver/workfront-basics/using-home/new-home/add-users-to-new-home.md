## Worklist

### Organize work with the My Work widget

The My Work widget was created as closely to the Legacy Home worklist as possible. Users can group and filter their worklist in the My Work widget with similar filters and groupings: 

| **Filter** | **Group** |
|------------|-----------|
| - Working on <br> - Ready to start <br> - Not ready <br> - Requested <br> - Delegated <br> - Completed | - Project <br> - Status – New <br> - Due date – similar to planned completion? |


**Legacy Home groupings not available in New Home**

* Planned completion date 
* Planned start 
* Commit Date 
* My Priority
