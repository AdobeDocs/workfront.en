## Updates that also appear on higher-rank objects

Comments or replies made to updates on certain objects also appear on the Updates section of higher-ranked objects.

For example, when you add an update to a task, the update appears on the Updates section for the task and on the Updates section for the project containing the task.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When enabling the new commenting experience, comments display on the following higher-ranking objects: 
>
>* Issues
>* Projects
>* Tasks
>
>For more information, see [New commenting experience](../../product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md). 

The following table shows the objects whose comments also display on their higher-ranking objects: 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th><strong>Object where the original update was added</strong> </th>

## Limitations of the Updates section

There are some limitations in the Updates section of a team and when entering updates on behalf of other users. 

### Limitations for users and teams

You cannot add new comments in the Updates section of a team. 

<span class="preview">You can add a reply to an update you view on a team. The reply displays in the team's Updates section as well as the Updates section of the object it belongs to. </span>

The Updates section for teams is populated by updates entered on the following objects:

* Users
* Timesheets
* Stories
* Iterations

On the Updates section for users and teams, you can view the updates that have been entered in the past 90 days.

If you want to see all the updates made on a user or a team, beyond the 90-day limit, you can build a report for notes. The report should not have a time filter that displays all updates made for users or teams. For more information, see [Create a custom report](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

### Limitations when entering comments on behalf of another user

Adobe Workfront administrators and group administrators can log in as other users and perform actions in Workfront such as entering comments. 

For information, see [Log in as another user](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/log-in-as-another-user.md).

Any comments made on behalf of another user are indicated on the comment.

<!--might need to update this note when the new commenting experience will be the only experience; also - how will this affect the areas that will keep the old experience, like Iterations?-->

>[!NOTE]
>
>When using the new commenting experience, the comment is added as the user who logged in as another user and there is no indication that they are adding a comment on someone else's behalf. 
>
>For example, if a Workfront administrator logs in as another user, the user associated with the comment is the Workfront administrator. For more information, see [New commenting experience](../../product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md). 


A group administrator can comment on behalf of another person but cannot delete that comment. Only an Adobe Workfront administrator can delete a comment that they made on behalf of another user.

## View system updates on work items with the Journal Entry report

The Journal Entry report surfaces system updates from the Updates area of projects, tasks, and issues.

The report allows you to see:

* How many status changes occurred
* When a task or issue was deleted
* How values in important custom fields changed over the course of a project
* What important dates changed over the course of a project
* If priority changed over the course of a project
* If the owner of a project changed

For more information, see [Report on the Updates area](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-journal-entry-report.md).
