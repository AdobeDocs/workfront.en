# Character limits in fields

Certain fields in Adobe Workfront limit the number of characters that can be included in the field. Workfront indexes content so that it can be searched at a later time. A character limit is enforced in order to ensure high-quality performance of the Workfront system.

When you approach the limit, a counter appears. When you exceed the limit, excess characters are highlighted, and you are unable to post the text. Delete characters until you are within the allowed limit.

The character limit differs depending on the field you are using. The limits shown below apply to languages that use a Latin alphabet (such as English). The limit might be lower for languages that contain extended or double-byte characters.
