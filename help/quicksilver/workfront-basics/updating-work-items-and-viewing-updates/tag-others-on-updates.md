title: Tag others on updates
description: When providing update comments on a Adobe Workfront object, all users on the project can see the information submitted. However, there may be times when users who are not on the project would benefit from viewing this information. Rather than include those users on the project, you can tag them on the update to share it with them. Tagged users receive an event notification.

# Tag others on updates

<!--take "Beta" references out when we remove the beta-->

<!-- Drafted for commenting experience: 

<!--
<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment.</span> 

>[!NOTE]
>
>We are currently redesigning the commenting experience in Adobe Workfront.
>For more information about the new updating experience, see [New commenting experience](../updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/unified-commenting-experience.md). 
>
>You can access the new design for the following objects:
> * <span class="preview">Issues, when enabling the commenting Beta. </span>
> * Goals
>   The new commenting experience is the default for goals. You must have an additional license to access Workfront Goals. For more information, see [Requirements to uses Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/access-needed-for-wf-goals.md).

You can tag users when making an update to an object if you want to draw their attention to an object they might otherwise not follow. 
Rather than include those users on the object by assigning them to it or making them subscribe to it, you can tag them on the update to share it with them. Tagged users receive a notification about the update you enter. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>An event notification must be enabled in order for a user to receive  the email notification. Administrators can enable notifications for the whole system or for a top-level group. A user can also enable and disable individual event notifications in their own user profile. For more information, see the following:
>
>* [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md).
>* [View and configure event notifications for a group](../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-configure-event-notifications-group.md) 
>* [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).
>

For information about adding updates to Workfront objects, see [Update work](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).

>[!NOTE]

>When an issue is converted to a project or task, the updates are copied to the new project or task, but the tagged users are not. To continue the conversation, you must tag the participants again.

## Tag others on updates

<!--
Tagging others in an update differs depending on which experience and which object you select.

### Tag others on updates in the current Updates section
-->

1. Begin updating a work item, as described in [Update work](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).
1. In the **Notify** field, begin typing the name of the user or team you want to include, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.

   Or

   Type the @ symbol in the **Start a new update** area, begin typing the name of the user or team you want to include on the update, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >To identify the correct user when there are users with similar or identical names, notice the avatar, the user's Primary Role, or their email address. Users must be associated with at least one job role to view it as you tag them in an update.

   ![](assets/tag-users-in-update.png)

1. (Optional) To make the update private, enable **Private to my company** in the lower-right corner of the update box. This makes the update visible just to users in your company.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Tagged users outside the company could still receive an in-app notification or email, even though they will not see the private comments on the Updates tab. We recommend not to tag external users on an update if you do not want to share the information with them.

1. (Optional) To add multiple users and teams, repeat step 2.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >All users and team members listed in the Notify field receive an in-app notification for the update and might receive an email, depending on the configuration of their email notification settings. Users who tag themselves in a comment or reply receive a notification for that comment or reply and can see their name in the Notify field for the remainder of the thread, but they do not receive another notification unless they tag themselves again. For more information, see [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md) and [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md).

1. Click **Update**.  
   Users included in the update are automatically granted View permission to the object and can view and respond to updates made to the object.

   You can see who has been tagged in each reply at the top of the update thread. These users, along with any users subscribed to the object, receive a notification whenever an update or reply is made on the object.
