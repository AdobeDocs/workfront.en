# Summarize updates with AI Assistant

Workfront's AI Assistant can summarize the contents of the update stream, allowing you to quickly understand the comments and discussions occurring around a Workfront object.

You can use the Summarize Contents button to generate a summary, or you can enter a prompt into AI Assistant.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The AI Assistant summarize functionality is different from the Summary panel.

>For information on the Summary panel in Workfront, see [Summary overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/summary-overview.md).
