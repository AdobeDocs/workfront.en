# Create personal tasks

<!--Audited: 10/2024-->

Personal tasks are ad hoc work requests that you send to a user, or to-do items that you create for yourself in your Home area.

Workfront saves ad hoc work requests and to do items as personal tasks. 

By default, all users in Workfront have a project called "< Their full name >'s Tasks". For example, "Rick Kuvec's Tasks". 
 
This project does not display in searches and it is hidden. All personal tasks are stored in this project. 

You can move personal tasks to a project, if needed.

You can create personal tasks in the following ways:

* Create a to do item in your Home area

    For information, see [Create work items and projects from the Home area](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/create-work-items-in-home.md). 

* Create a personal work request to another user
* Create a personal work request for your user

This article describes how you can create a personal work request for a user.

## Create a personal work request

1. Go to your user's profile page, or go to another user's profile page that you have access to view.

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >Your Workfront administrator might prevent you from seeing certain users when they configure your access level. 

1. Click the **More menu** ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the user's name in the header.
1. Click **Send work** request. 
    The **Send user a work request** box displays.

    ![](assets/personal-task-box.png)
1. Update the following information: 

    * **Task Name**: This is the name of the ad hoc work request or the personal task. 
    * **Description**: Add a description for the task. 
    * **Assign to**: The name of the user that you selected displays by default. You can add more users or teams.
    * **Due date**: This is the date by which you'd like this task to be completed. By default, this is today's date. You cannot select a date in the past
    * **Time**: This is the time by which you'd like this task to be completed. By default, this is the current time. 

1. Click **Send Request** to save the work request.

    The work request is saved as a personal task in Workfront and it is added to your To do widget in the Home area.

    <!--this last step will need to be updated when they fix this functionality and the work requests you create for others actually go to their To do widget instead of yours-->

## Locate personal tasks

You can locate personal tasks in the following areas:

* The To do widget in the Home area. For information, see [Create work items and projects from the Home area](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/create-work-items-in-home.md). 

* A personal task report or list. You can build and apply a personal task filter to a task report or list, For information, see [Filter: personal tasks](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-personal-tasks.md).
