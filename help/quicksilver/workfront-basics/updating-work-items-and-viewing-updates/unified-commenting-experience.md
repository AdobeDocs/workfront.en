# New commenting experience

<!--
<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment.</span> -->

An update to the commenting experience in Adobe Workfront is currently in development. This update includes a new interface, new features, and improved performance in the Updates section of select objects. 

<!--drafted for commenting experience on issues: 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The new commenting experience is not available for other areas of Workfront that displays updates. For example, the new experience is not availabe for the following areas:
>
>* Home
>* Summary panel in a list
>* Summary panel in a timesheet
>
>The new commenting experience is only available for the Updates section of select objects. 
>
>For information about what objects include the Updates section, see [Updates tab overview](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md). 
-->

While currently only implemented in Adobe Workfont Goals, this new experience will slowly become available for all the objects with an Updates section in Workfront, and later it will expand to other Adobe Experience Cloud applications.

<!--when we release to Preview for issues with a toggle, we need to remove the last sentence above and replace it with this: 

The new commenting experience is currently supported for the following objects in Workfront:

By default, in the Preview and Production environments for all customers: 

* Goals

## Features

The new commenting experience includes improvements and changes to the existing update stream.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The Unified Commenting Experience features listed below are currently only available in Adobe Workfront Goals.

* **Creating comments**

    You can create a new comment, format it with rich text, and tag others to be notified. For more information on creating comments, see [Manage goal comments](/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md).

* **Responding to comments**

    You can react to a comment with a like or reply with a new comment in-thread that can notify the original commenter and owner of the object.

* **System Activity**
    
    System-generated updates for an object are now listed seperately from comments made in the update tab. For more information on viewing the System Activity stream, see step 11 of [Manage goal comments](/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md).

<!-- When releasing this to Issues - preview with 23.2 - remove all the content above in the "Features" section and replace it with this: 

One of the main differences between the current and the new commenting experience is the separation of user-submitted comments and system activity updates with the introduction of the System Activity tab. There are no changes to the way system-generated activity updates function.

Among the improvements included in the new commenting experience are the following:

* Better, faster performance 
* Real-time updates
* Edit comments after submitting them. 

The following table illustrates the features that will be available in the new commenting experience as well as their availability now in areas where they are supported:
