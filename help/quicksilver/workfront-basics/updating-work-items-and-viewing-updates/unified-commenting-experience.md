# New Commenting Experience

An update to the commenting experience in Adobe Workfront is currently in development, including a new interface, new features, and improved performance. While currently only implemented in Adobe Workfont Goals, this new experience will eventually unify commenting across Adobe Workfront and beyond throughout the Adobe Experience Cloud. 

## Features

The new commenting experience includes improvements and changes to the existing update stream.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The Unified Commenting Experience features listed below are currently only available in Adobe Workfront Goals.

* **Creating comments**\
You can create a new comment, format it with rich text, and tag others to be notified. For more information on creating comments, see [Manage goal comments](/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md).

* **Responding to comments**\
You can react to a comment with a like or reply with a new comment in-thread that can notify the original commenter and owner of the object.

* **System Activity**\
System-generated updates for an object are now listed seperately from comments made in the update tab. For more information on viewing the System Activity stream, see step 11 of [Manage goal comments](/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md).
