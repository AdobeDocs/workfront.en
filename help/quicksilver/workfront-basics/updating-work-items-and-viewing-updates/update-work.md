# Update work

<!--take "Beta" references out when we remove the beta-->

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment.</span>

>[!NOTE]
>
>We are currently redesigning the commenting experience in Adobe Workfront.
>
>For more information about the new commenting experience, see [New commenting experience](../../product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md). 
>
>You can access the new experience for the following objects:
> * Issues, <span class="preview">projects, tasks, and documents</span>.
>
>     This is available when you enable the commenting Beta experience.
>
>     This functionality is available only for the Updates section, and it is not available for the following areas:
>
>     * Home
>     * Summary panel in lists
>     * Summary panel in timesheets
>
> * Goals
>
>   The new commenting experience is the default for goals. You must have an additional license to access Workfront Goals. For more information, see [Requirements to uses Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/access-needed-for-wf-goals.md). 
>
>    For information about commenting on goals, see [Manage goal comments in Adobe    Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md).

You can add comments to most objects in Adobe Workfront in the Updates section. For more information about which objects display the Updates section, see [Updates section overview](../updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md). 

You can add an update on an Workfront object (project, task, or issue) to communicate about progress on the object, as you comment on the object. Users who are assigned or subscribed to the object can view your update. You can also tag users to bring their attention to the update. Tagged users receive an in-app notification and an email about your update. 

The information on this page describes how you can comment on Workfront objects and how you update projects, tasks, and issues. For information about commenting on goals, see [Manage goal comments in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md). You must have an additional license to access Workfront Goals. 


You can add an update to projects, tasks, and issues from the following areas of Workfront:

* From a Workfront object, in the Updates  section  
* From the Home area (for tasks and issues)
* From the Summary panel in a list of objects (for tasks and issues)
* From the timesheet (for tasks and issues)

## Use Rich Text in a Workfront update{#use-rich-text-in-a-workfront-update} 

<!--remove this top note when we get to parity with the current version, OR change the note to mention that some options are ONLY available in the Beta version and not the current one.-->

>[!NOTE]
>
>Some of the options in the Rich Text toolbar might not be available for the commenting Beta experience.

You can enhance your updates by using Rich Text, or adding various items to it, like emojis, links, or images. 

1. Go to the Updates area and start typing a comment. 
1. (Optional) To add rich text formatting to your update, use any attributes on the **Rich Text** toolbar as you type.

   | **Attribute** |**Toolbar button** |**Mac shortcut keys** |**Windows shortcut keys** |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Bold | ![mceclip10.png](assets/mceclip10.png)|⌘+b |Ctrl+B |

    To stop formatting text, deselect the attribute on the **Rich Text** toolbar.

   <!-- in the table above: take "Create Links" verbiage from the hyperlink when the old commenting is removed and the commenting beta is the only way to comment-->

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* Formatting also displays in any email notification users receive containing your update.
   >* Rich Text formatting applied to an update in an email does not display on the update when viewed in the Updates tab.  
   >* If your organization uses Workfront with Internet Explorer, any formatted text pasted into an update loses its Rich Text formatting and displays as plain text. You can reformat the text using the attributes on the Rich Text toolbar.
   >* Rich Text formatting is not available for updates made in the Timesheets area or for Note and Last Condition objects viewed in a report.

1. (Optional) If you want to include text from previous updates or from other sources and distinguish it from your own update, you can mark it as a Block Quote. Click the **Block Quote** icon ![](assets/block-quote-small.png) and type the text you want to quote. The quoted text displays marked with a vertical gray line. Click the **Block Quote** icon again to return to normal formatting.

   ![](assets/block-quote-marked-350x144.png)

1. (Optional) Add emojis to your update.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* Workfront does not replace punctuation emoticons such as :) with emojis.
   >* Emojis are not available for updates made in the Timesheets area or for Note and Last Condition objects viewed in a report.
   >* The emoji feature in Workfront utilizes Unicode characters and, as such, displays only on browsers and operating systems that support Unicode code points. Users on a platform, browser, or operating system version different than yours might not have access to the same emojis.
   >* An unsupported emoji is represented by a black or white box.
   >* Windows 7 supports only black and white emojis.  
   >* Emojis that are applied to an update made via email do not display on the update when viewed in the Updates area.

1. (Optional) To add a URL link to additional information sources:

   1. Click in your update where you want to insert a link.
   1. On the **Rich Text** toolbar, click the **Hyperlink** icon ![](assets/link-icon.png).  

   1. In the **Create Link** box that appears, under **URL**, type or paste the URL of the source to which you want to link.
   
   1. Under **Text to display**, type or paste the link text.
   1. Click **Save**.

1. (Optional) To attach an image to your update, do one of the following, depending on the environment you use:

   * Click the **Image** icon ![](assets/addimageicon-35x32.png) and browse to the image on your computer or drag the image into the update area, when using the current updating experience

   Or

   Click the **Add attachment** icon ![](assets/add-image-paperclip-icon.png) and browse to the image on your computer, when using the commenting Beta experience. <!--the name of the icon and the icon for it might change-->

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* Your Workfront administrator must enable adding images in the Update Feeds Preferences section of the Workfront Interface area before you can see the Image or the Add attachment icons. For information, see [Configure preferences for user updates](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/system-tracked-update-feeds/configure-preferences-user-updates.md). 
   >* The maximum image file size is 7 MB. Supported image file types are .jpg, .gif, and .png.
   >* Images are accessible from the Updates section on an object and they are also available in the Documents area. 
   >* You can send an update with an image and no text.
   >* When you delete a comment that contains an image, the following scenarios exist depending on which experience you choose: 
   >
   >     * In the current commenting experience, the image remains in the Documents area but is no longer visible in the Updates section.
   >     * In the new commenting experience, the image is removed from the Updates section as well as from the Documents area. The image is also deleted from the Documents area when you edit a comment and delete the image.

   ![](assets/update-stream-reply-menu-marked-350x182.png)

## Delete an update or reply

Depending on the access your Workfront administrator gives you, you might be able to delete updates you added on the Updates tab of an object. For more information, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md#creating-a-new-access-from-scratch) in the article [Create or modify custom access levels](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

No Workfront user (including the Workfront administrator) can delete updates made by another user. However, if a user's access level allows them to delete their own updates, the Workfront administrator can log in as that user and delete updates they made. For more information, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md#creating-a-new-access-from-scratch) and [Log in as another user](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/log-in-as-another-user.md).

1. Go to the update or reply you want to delete.
1. Click the **More** menu next to the update or reply you wish to delete, then click **Delete**.

   ![](assets/update-stream-comment-menu-marked-350x152.png)

1. In the message that appears, click **Confirm** or click **Delete**, when using the commenting Beta experience.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Deleting an update with an attached image deletes both the comment and the image. For more information, see the [Use rich text in a Workfront update](#use-rich-text-in-a-workfront-update) section in this article.

   When the comment you delete has replies associated with it, there is an indication that the comment was removed with the name of the user who removed it.

   ![](assets/removed-comment-indicator-new-experience.png) 

   When using the commenting Beta experience, deleted comments are removed immediately from Workfront. A user using the Updates section sees a comment being deleted by another user in real time.

   <!--when we remove the beta, take out the first part of the sentence above about only when commenting in beta experience. Leave the rest though-->

## Add an update on a Timesheet

1. Go to a Timesheet on which you want to make an update.
1. Click the Timesheet to open it.
1. At the bottom of the Timesheet, click **Include a comment**.
1. In the box that displays at the bottom of the Timesheet, type an update.

   ![timesheet_update_stream.png](assets/timesheet-update-stream-350x50.png)

1. (Conditional)To save your update without submitting the Timesheet for approval, click **Save for Later**.

   Or

   To save your update and submit the Timesheet for approval, click **Submit for Approval**.

   Or

   If your Timesheet is not set up with an approver, click **Save and Close Timesheet** to save your update.

## Enable or disable system updates

<!--remove the preview tag with 23.2 production, but keep the note till we remove Beta and it becomed the only exprience: -->

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is not possible to disable system updates when using the Beta commenting experience.
>The information in this section refers only to functionality available in the current Updtes section.
>For more information about system updates in the Beta version, see [Updates section overview](../updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md).


The Updates section for a Workfront object displays two types of information:

* **User updates:** User updates are comments that you and other users in your system enter.

  ![](assets/user-update-cl-350x277.png)

* **System updates:** System updates record removing assets, adding or deleting versions, attaching or removing an approval request, as well as any edits or changes made to the documents on the object.

  ![](assets/system-updates-cl-350x277.png)

Depending on your Workfront license, system updates might be enabled by default. Workfront administrators can determine what is tracked in system updates, as explained in [System-tracked updates](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/system-tracked-update-feeds/system-tracked-update-feeds.md). You can also filter out system updates or activities so that you see only user updates for all objects.

For more information about the difference between user and system updates, see [System-tracked updates](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/system-tracked-update-feeds/system-tracked-update-feeds.md).

To enable or disable system updates:

1. Click the **Updates** tab on an object.
1. Click **Show System Updates** to slide the switch left (disabled) or right (enabled).

   ![](assets/show-system-updates-qs-350x55.png)

   This option is persistent across all objects throughout Workfront and remains in the position you select, even if you log out of Workfront.
