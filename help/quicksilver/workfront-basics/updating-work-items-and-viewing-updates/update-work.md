You can add an update to an Adobe Workfront object by adding a comment to it to inform others about the status or the progress on the object, or to ask for more information or additional resources. 

For more information about what objects you can add updates to in Workfront, see [Update section overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md). 

The information in this article describes how you can comment on projects, tasks, and issues. Users who are assigned to or subscribed to the object can view your update. You can also tag users to bring their attention to the update. 

Adding comments to other Workfront objects is similar to updating projects, tasks, and issues. 

For additional information about commenting on cards, goals, and records in Workfront Planning also see the following articles: 

* [Manage goal comments in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md). 

* [Add an ad hoc card to a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/add-card-to-board.md)

* [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md)

## Considerations about commenting on objects

* You can add comments to most objects in Adobe Workfront in the Updates section. For more information about which objects display the Updates section, see [Updates section overview](../updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md). 

* You can add comments to Workfront objects from other applications that are integrated with Workfront or from the Workfront mobile app. 

   Not all applications that are integrated with Workfront can add comments to Workfront objects. 
   
   Not all features that are available in the Updates section of an object in Workfront are available in other applications, when accessing Workfront objects from the application. For example, Rich Text capabilities or making a comment private to someone's Company might not be available when adding comments to a Workfront object from a third-party application. 

* You can communicate about progress on a Workfront object (project, task, or issue), as you comment on the object. Users who are assigned or subscribed to the object can receive a notification about your update. Anyone with View access to the object can view your update. 

* You can tag users to bring their attention to the update. Tagged users receive an in-app notification and an email about your update. 

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Comment owners are automatically tagged. For more information, see [Tag others on updates](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md). 

   
* You can add a comment to an object that you can view, or you can log in as a Workfront or group administrator and add a comment on behalf of another user. For more information, see [Log in as another user](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/log-in-as-another-user.md). 

* You can add an update to projects, tasks, and issues from the following areas of Workfront:

   * From a Workfront object, in the Updates section (for projects, tasks, and issues)  
   * From the Home area (for tasks and issues)

      For information, see [Manage your work with the My Work widget](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/my-work-widget.md).
   * From the Summary panel in the following areas (for tasks, issues, and documents):
   
      * A list of objects
      * A timesheet
      * Home
      * The Workload Balancer 

      For more information, see the following articles:

      * [Summary overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/summary-overview.md)
      * [Update work items in the Workload Balancer using the Summary](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/update-items-in-summary-panel-in-workload-balancer.md)

* Projects
* Tasks
* Issues
* Programs
* Portfolios
* Templates
* Template tasks
* Users
* Timesheets
* Teams
* Goals

>The information on this page describes how you update projects, tasks, and issues.

1. Go to the work item for which you want to provide an update (such as a project, task, or issue).
1. Click the **Updates** section.
1. (Conditional) If it is enabled, click the **New commenting** option in the upper-right corner of the Updates section to disable it and enable the legacy commenting experience.
1. Click **Start a new update,** then type your update.  
1. (Optional) Use the options in the Rich Text toolbar to format your text, add emojis, links, or images to your update, to enhance your content. For more information, see the [Use Rich Text in a Workfront update](#use-rich-text-in-a-workfront-update) section in this article.

## Add a comment to a work item 

This article describes how you can update projects, tasks, or issues. Updating most other objects is similar. 

1. Locate the object you want to add a comment to, then click its name to open the object's page.
1. Click  **Updates** in the left panel. 
   The **Comments** tab is selected by default.

1. Start entering a comment in the **New comment** box.

   ![New comment box](assets/comment-box-all-tabs.png)
   
   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Navigating away from the Updates section before you finish typing and submitting a comment keeps the comment on the page in draft mode even after you log off and log back on. Any images that are added to the comment are also saved in the draft. Drafts are saved for 7 days after which they are discarded and cannot be recovered. Drafted comments are only visible to the user entering them.

1. (Optional) To undo or redo a change, use the following shortcut keys:
      * CTRL + Z (⌘+z for Mac) to undo a change 
      * CTRL + Y (⌘+y for Mac) to redo a change

1. (Optional) In the **Tag people or teams** area, start typing the name or the email of a user, or a team that you would like to include in this comment, then select it when it displays in the list. 
1. (Optional) Use the options in the Rich Text toolbar to format your text, add emojis, links, or images to your update, to enhance your content. For more information, see the [Use Rich Text in a Workfront update](#use-rich-text-in-a-workfront-update) section in this article. 

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >If another user submits a comment to the same item you are updating, there is a red line with a "New" indicator to inform you of the newer comments. 
      >
      >The indicator displays only after the comment was submitted on the item, and not when the comment is still composed. 
      >
      >The "New" indicator displays only when both the user that entered a new update as well as the user who is currently entering an update are using the new commenting experience. 
      >![](assets/real-time-new-red-indicator-unified-commenting.png)

1. Click **Submit** to add the update to the Workfront object. 
1. (Optional) To edit a comment, click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) in the upper-right corner of the comment, then click **Edit**.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >You can edit your comment only within 15 minutes from submitting it.  

1. Edit the information in the comment, add or remove images or remove any of the tagged users. An "Edited" indicator is added to the left of the date stamp that displays when the comment was entered.
   
      >[!TIP]
      >
      >Comments from the current year do not display the year in the date stamp. Hovering over a timestamp displays the full date, including the year.

   ![](assets/edited-tag-on-comment-unified-commenting.png)

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >* An email is generated to notify users of your update only when you submit the original update. No email is generated after you edited your update.
   >* The date stamp next to the comment is the date of the original comment, not the date of the last edit. 
   >* When you add a comment on behalf of another user (when logging in as another user as a Workfront or group administrator), you cannot edit the comment if you are logged in as the other user. You can edit the comment only after you log out as the user and log back in as yourself.

1. (Optional) Click **Reply** or start typing a comment in the **Add reply ...** area, to reply to an existing comment, then follow the steps 3-7 above. <!--(**************insure this stays accurate***********)--> For information about replying to an update, see [Reply to updates](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/reply-to-updates.md).  

1. (Conditional and optional) If other users have added comments that display outside of the visible area in the Updates section while you were adding your comments, click **View** inside the blue **new comments banner** at the bottom of the screen  to display these comments.

   ![](assets/blue-new-comments-banner-with-view-button.png)

1. (Optional) Click a commenter's name to see their name, role, and email address in an information box. Click the commenter's name again in the information box to open their user profile.
1. (Optional) Click the **System Activity** tab to view updates logged by the system. When the object or any of its children are updated, Workfront generates a note about that update and displays it in the System Activity tab. 

   For more information, see [Updates section overview](../updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md).

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You cannot add a comment to a system update. However, any replies that were made to system activity records in the legacy commenting experience were added to the System Activity tab as read-only. The legacy commenting experience has been removed from Workfront on April 11, 2024. 

1. (Optional) Click the **All** tab to view both user comments and system activity comments in one place. This is a view-only tab.

   >[!TIP]

## Use Rich Text in a Workfront comment{#use-rich-text-in-a-workfront-comment}

You can enhance your comments by using Rich Text, or adding various items to it, like emojis, links, or images. 

1. Go to the **Updates** area of a Workfront object, open the **Comments** tab and start typing a comment. 
1. (Optional) To add Rich Text formatting to your comment, use any attributes on the **Rich Text** toolbar as you type. 

   ![](assets/rich-text-toolbar.png)

   | **Attribute** |**Toolbar button** |**Mac shortcut keys** |**Windows shortcut keys** |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Bold | ![](assets/mceclip10.png)|⌘+b |Ctrl+B |

   <!--| Block Quote | ![](assets/block-quote-icon-large.png)|⌘+Shift+9 |<br>Ctrl+Shift+9</br> <br>This is not available in the new commenting experience. </br> |-->
   
   <!--remove the last row when we remove legacy from the system-->

   To stop formatting text, deselect the attribute on the **Rich Text** toolbar.


   <!-- in the table above: take "Create Links" verbiage from the hyperlink when the old commenting is removed and the commenting beta is the only way to comment - with October 2023-->

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* Formatting also displays in any email notification users receive containing your update.
   >* Rich Text formatting applied to an update in an email does not display on the update when viewed in the Updates tab.  
   >* If your organization uses Workfront with Internet Explorer, any formatted text pasted into an update loses its Rich Text formatting and displays as plain text. You can reformat the text using the attributes on the Rich Text toolbar.
   >* Rich Text formatting is not available for updates made in the Timesheets area or for Note and Last Condition objects viewed in a report.

   <!--1. (Optional and conditional) If you want to include text from previous updates or from other sources and distinguish it from your own update, you can mark it as a Block Quote. Click the **Block Quote** icon ![](assets/block-quote-small.png) and type the text you want to quote. The quoted text displays marked with a vertical gray line. Click the **Block Quote** icon again to return to normal formatting. This is not available in the new commenting experience.-->

      <!--![](assets/block-quote-marked-350x144.png)-->

1. (Optional) Click the **emoji** icon ![](assets/emoji-icon.png) to add emojis to your update. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* Workfront does not replace punctuation emoticons such as :) with emojis.
   >* Emojis are not available for the Note and Last Condition objects viewed in a report.
   >* The emoji feature in Workfront utilizes Unicode characters and, as such, displays only on browsers and operating systems that support Unicode code points. Users on a platform, browser, or operating system version different from yours might not have access to the same emojis.
   >* An unsupported emoji is represented by a black or white box.
   >* Windows 7 supports only black and white emojis.  
   >* Emojis that are applied to an update made via email do not display on the update when viewed in the Updates area.

1. (Optional) To add a URL link to additional information sources:

   1. Click in your update where you want to insert a link.
   1. On the **Rich Text** toolbar, click the **Hyperlink** icon ![](assets/link-icon.png).  

   1. In the **Create Link** box, under **URL**, type or paste the URL of the source to which you want to link.
   
   1. Under **Text to display**, type or paste the link text.
   1. Click **Save**.

1. (Optional) To attach an image to your update, do one of the following: 

   * Save the image on our computer, then drag and drop it in the New comment area.
   * Copy a screenshot from your computer, then paste it in the comment.
   * Click the **Add image** icon ![](assets/add-image-mountain-with-plus-icon.png) and browse to the image on your computer. 

   
   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >**IMPORTANT**
   >
   ><!--<span class="preview">You cannot add images to goals or ad-hoc cards on boards.</span> -->
   >
   >* Your Workfront administrator must enable adding images in the Update Feeds Preferences section of the Workfront Interface area before you can see the Image or the Add attachment icons. For information, see [Configure preferences for user updates](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/system-tracked-update-feeds/configure-preferences-user-updates.md). 
   >* The maximum image file size is 7 MB. Supported image file types are .jpg, .gif, and .png.
   >* Images are accessible from the Updates section on an object and they are also available in the Documents area under the Main Menu. 
   >You can copy a screenshot from your computer using a keyboard combination, or, for example, the Print Screen function (on Windows computers).
   >* You can paste the image by right-clicking in the new comment then clicking **Paste**, or by pressing CTRL + V for Windows (or ⌘ + V for Mac) on your keyboard.
   >* You can send an update with an image and no text.
   >* When you delete a comment that contains an image, the image is removed from the Updates section as well as from the Documents area. The image is also deleted from the Documents area when you edit a comment and delete the image.
   >* When someone deletes an image attached to a comment from the Documents area, it is also removed from the comment.

   <!--remove the statement above about legacy, when we remove the legacy environment.-->

1. (Optional) To view an image in the existing update do one of the following:

   * Click the **Download** icon ![](assets/downloadimageicon.png) on the image thumbnail to download the image.
  
1. Click **Submit** to add your comment. 

## Search for an update

You can search for a comment or a reply in the Updates section of an object. 

1. Go to the **Updates** section of an object.
1. Start typing a keyword <!--or a user's name --> in the **Search** box in the upper-right corner of the **Comments** tab. 

      <!--Add this tip or note instead of the note below - when it'll be possible: You can search for users who have been tagged or for comment owners.-->

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >You can search only for words that belong to the text of a comment or reply. You cannot search for names of users or teams tagged in an update.

      ![Search in updates](assets/updates-all-tabs-with-search-field.png)

      The keyword <!--or user--> you searched for is highlighted and the comments that contain it display at the top of the Updates section. 
   
      Workfront searches the entire update stream of the object, outside the comments that are visible on the screen. 

1. Click the **x** icon in the search field to clear the search results and return to all comments.

<!-- when we release search to production, check above and make sure you don't have to add that the users tagged/ owners are also searchable-->

## Copy comments

There are several ways you can copy a comment. 

You can copy a link to the comment, or copy the content of the comment to use it in a new update. 

<!--Copying an update differs depending on which commenting experience you use.-->

<!--info for April 11: take the sentence above out and reword the section title below to: Copy an update-->

### Copy a comment

You can copy information from an existing comment by doing one of the following:

## Delete a comment or a reply

Depending on the access your Workfront administrator gives you, you might be able to delete comments you added in the Updates section of an object. 

For more information, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md#creating-a-new-access-from-scratch) in the article [Create or modify custom access levels](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

No Workfront user (including the Workfront administrator) can delete updates made by another user. However, if a user's access level allows them to delete their own updates, the Workfront administrator can log in as that user and delete updates they made. For more information, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md#creating-a-new-access-from-scratch) and [Log in as another user](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/log-in-as-another-user.md).

1. Go to the comment or reply you want to delete.
1. Click the **More** menu next to the comment or reply you wish to delete, then click **Delete**.

1. In the message that appears, click **Delete**. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Deleting an update with an attached image deletes both the comment and the image. For more information, see the [Use Rich Text in a Workfront update](#use-rich-text-in-a-workfront-update) section in this article.

   When the comment you delete has replies associated with it, there is an indication that the comment was removed with the name of the user who removed it.

   Deleted comments are removed immediately from Workfront. A user using the Updates section sees a comment being deleted by another user in real time.


## Review system updates

The Updates section for a Workfront object displays two types of information:

* **User updates:** User updates are comments that you and other users in your system enter. The user updates display in the Comments and the All tabs of the Updates section.

* **System updates:** System updates record removing tasks or issues, adding or deleting document versions, attaching or removing an approval request, as well as any edits or changes made to the object. System updates display in the System Activity and the All tabs of the Updates section. 

  ![](assets/system-updates-cl-350x277.png)

   Workfront administrators can determine what is tracked in system updates, as explained in [System-tracked updates](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/system-tracked-update-feeds/system-tracked-update-feeds.md). You can also filter out system updates or activities so that you see only user updates for all objects.

   The following objects don't have system-generated updates: 

   * Team
   * Template
   * Template Task
   * Ad-hoc Card

For more information about user and system updates and how they display in the Updates section of Workfront objects, see [Updates section overview](../updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md).

<!-- with October 26 release: add somewhere this, and decide where we need to keep information about the legacy commenting. Should we create an article about iterations comments like we have for goals and cards?!:
