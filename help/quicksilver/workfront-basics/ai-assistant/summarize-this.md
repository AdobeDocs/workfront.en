# Summarize using AI Assistant

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.</span>

Workfront's AI Assistant can summarize some objects, giving you a high-level view of the object's intent or details. 

For example, if you ask AI Assistant to summarize a project, it returns brief descriptions of the project's purpose and status, gives examples of tasks that are completed and that are still pending, and provides some additional details and notes.

AI Assistant can summarize the following objects:

* Projects
* Tasks
* Issues
* Documents

>[!NOTE]
>
>The AI Assistant summarize functionality is different from the Summary panel.

>For information on the Summary panel in Workfront, see [Summary overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/summary-overview.md).

## Summarize using Summarize buttons

The following areas have buttons that generate summaries using AI Assistant:

* Project header: Summarize project
* Updates area: Summarize comments

To use the Summarize project or Summarize comments button:

1. Click the button.

   AI Assistant opens, with a prompt to summarize the project or the last 7 days of comments on the update stream.

   AI Assistant may take a few moments to generate the summary, depending on how large or complex the object is.

1. View the AI summary in the AI Assistant panel.
1. (Optional) Refine the prompt to ensure that it gives you the information you need. 

   For example, you can refine the Summarize Contents prompt to summarize comments for the last 14 days, instead of the last 7.
