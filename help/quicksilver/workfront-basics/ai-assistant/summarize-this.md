# Summarize using AI Assistant

Workfront's AI Assistant can summarize some objects, giving you a high-level view of the object's intent or details. 

For example, if you ask AI Assistant to summarize a project, it returns brief descriptions of the project's purpose and status, gives examples of tasks that are completed and that are still pending, and provides some additional details and notes.

AI Assistant can summarize the following objects:

* Projects
* Tasks
* Issues
* Documents

>[!NOTE]
>
>The AI Assistant summarize functionality is different from the Summary panel. 
>
>For information on the Summary panel in Workfront, see [Summary overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/summary-overview.md).
