## Access requirements

You must have the following access to enable or disable AI Assistant:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td><p>New: Any</p>
       <p>or</p>
       <p>Current: Not available</p></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td><p>New: Standard</p>
       <p>or</p>
       <p>Current: Not available</p></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
