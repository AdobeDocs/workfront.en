# Auto-fill a request using AI

AI can help you auto-fill request fields, by using information from filled fields or by parsing text such as an email.

Will not overwrite anything already there.

Can approve or reject changes ony by one or all at once.


## Fill in a field

Looks at past requests and recommends other fields based on the fields you have filled in.

## Paste in text

Can copy and paste email content into form or into section.
