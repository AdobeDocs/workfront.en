# Auto-fill a request using AI

AI can help you auto-fill request fields. It can suggest field values based on previous requests, or parse them from text such as emails ar uploaded documents. 

You can approve or reject these suggestions before submitting the request.

Auto-fill does not overwrite any fields that you have already filled in.

Users do not receive suggestions of data that they do not otherwise have access to.

For instructions, see the following:

* [Auto-complete a request with data from previous requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/autofill-suggestions-from-previous.md)
* [Use AI Form Fill to fill in a request using prompts or documents](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/autofill-from-prompt-document.md)

   To use auto-filling from prompts or documents, your organization must meet the requirements to use the Workfront AI Assistant. For details, see [Prerequisites to AI Assistant](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-overview.md#prerequisites-to-ai-assistant).
