# Revise calculated field formulas with AI Assistant

You can use AI Assistant to resolve errors in your invalid custom expressions in calculated fields.

When you are creating the calculated field in the custom form builder, an error message appears under the field if the formula is invalid.

AI Assistant can help you revise your formula into a valid calculated field expression.
