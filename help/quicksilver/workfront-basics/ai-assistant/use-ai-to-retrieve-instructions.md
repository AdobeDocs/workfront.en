# Get help from AI Assistant

AI Assistant can locate information from Workfront documentation, eliminating the need for you to visit Adobe Experience League to get the help you need. 

For example, if you ask AI Assistant "How do I create a request queue," it returns instructions for creating the request, pulled from the article [Create and manage Request Queues](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td><p>New: Any</p>
       <p>or</p>
       <p>Current: Not available</p></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td><p>New: Standard</p>
       <p>or</p>
       <p>Current: Not available</p></td>
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

For more detail about the information in this table, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md).
