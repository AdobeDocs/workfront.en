Workfront's AI Assistant helps you accomplish your work by offering in-app information and suggestions in a natural-language conversation. AI Assistant can give you a smoother work experience by

* Finding instructions or reference material for work processes
* Generating or checking formulas for calculated fields  

## Access requirements

  </tr>

</table>

For more detail about the information in this table, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md).## Prerequisites to AI Assistant

## Considerations about AI Assistant

* AI Assistant is context sensitive to the page that you have open. For example, entering "Summarize this project" into AI Assistant on a project page returns a summary of that specific project.
* The Workfront administrator must enable AI Assistant for users in your organization. AI Assistant is enabled through access levels.

   For more information, see [Enable or disable AI Assistant](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/enable-or-disable-assistant.md).

* Workfront Planning AI Assistant has different features than Workfront AI Assistant.

1. Type your question or prompt into the panel at the right of the screen.

   If you cannot type into this panel, your organization does not have a signed Adobe Gen AI agreement on file.
