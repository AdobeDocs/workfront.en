# Notifications: Communication

The following notifications alert you about communication, such as an update comment, happening on a work item you are involved with. For information about configuring which notifications you receive, see [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>These notifications alert you about all comments that have been posted on a specific item. For this reason, you must select or deselect all of the notifications at the same time to be delivered in a daily digest email. If you want to be notified about certain comments only as they happen, you can specify the individual notifications be for instant delivery.
