# Notifications: Goals

You can enable your email notifications for events occurring in Adobe Workfront Goals in your profile. A user with a Plan license can also enable them for other users. For information, see [Adobe Workfront notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/wf-notifications.md).

## Access requirements

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: because there are conditions for who sees this, I added this from the How To articles/ template although this is not a How To. But I like the format, so I thought keeping it consistent might help users. We may decide to update this when we have access and prereq for overview-type articles)</p>
-->

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Product</strong></td> 
   <td>Workfront Goals <p>For information about Workfront Goals, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-management/wf-goals-overview.md" class="MCXref xref">Adobe Workfront Goals overview</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>View access to Goals or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> <!--
   <tr data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> 
    <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
    <td> <p>[Insert permissions needed]</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
   </tr>
  --> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Goals notifications in the user profile area
