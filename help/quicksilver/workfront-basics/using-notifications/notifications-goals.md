# Notifications: Goals

You can enable your email notifications for events occurring in [!DNL Adobe Workfront Goals] in your profile. A user with a [!UICONTROL Plan] license can also enable them for other users. For information, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront] notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/wf-notifications.md).

## Access requirements

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: because there are conditions for who sees this, I added this from the How To articles/ template although this is not a How To. But I like the format, so I thought keeping it consistent might help users. We may decide to update this when we have access and prereq for overview-type articles)</p>
-->

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront plan*]</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td>
