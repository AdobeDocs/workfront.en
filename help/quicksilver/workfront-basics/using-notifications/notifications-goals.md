You can enable your email notifications for events occurring in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront Goals in your profile. A user with a Plan license can also enable them for other users. For information, see [Adobe Workfront notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/wf-notifications.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Workfront Goals are available only in The new Adobe Workfront experience.

## Access requirements

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: because there are conditions for who sees this, I added this from the How To articles/ template although this is not a How To. But I like the format, so I thought keeping it consistent might help users. We may decide to update this when we have access and prereq for overview-type articles)</p>
-->

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans" target="_blank">Adobe Workfront plan</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

   <td role="rowheader">Access level*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access to Goals or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level.

## Goals notifications in the user profile area

The notifications listed in the following table alert you about events happening in Workfront Goals, such as someone assigning you a goal, result, or activity or someone making an update on a goal, result, or activity that you own. For information about configuring which notifications you receive, see [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).
