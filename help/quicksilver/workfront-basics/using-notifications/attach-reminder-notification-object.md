# Attach a reminder notification to an object

Reminder notifications can be associated with several different object types: Projects, Tasks, Issues, Timesheets, Templates, Template Tasks, and Recurring Timesheet Profiles.

Before you can attach reminder notifications to an object, an Adobe Workfront administrator must create the notification, as described in&nbsp; [Set up reminder notifications](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/set-up-reminder-notifications.md).&nbsp;

The steps to attach a reminder ```notifications```&nbsp;are the same, regardless of the object type that you are attaching them to.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Work </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage access to the object</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Attach reminder notifications to an object

1. Go to the object where you want to attach the reminder notification.
1. Click the Edit icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png).
1. In the left panel of the **Edit** box that appears, click **Settings**.

1. Under **Reminder Notification**, select the notifications that you want to attach to the object.

   In this example, the object being edited is a task:

   If the Workfront administrator has created multiple reminder notifications, you can attach multiple notifications to a single object.

1. Click **Save Changes**.

   If you need help testing the delivery of a reminder notification, see your Workfront administrator.
