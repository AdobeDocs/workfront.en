# Attach a reminder notification to an object

You can associate reminder notifications with several different object types: Projects, Tasks, Issues, Timesheets, Templates, Template Tasks, and Recurring Timesheet Profiles.

Before you can attach reminder notifications to an object, an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator must create the notification, as described in [Set up reminder notifications](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/set-up-reminder-notifications.md). 

The steps to attach a reminder notifications are the same, regardless of the object type that you are attaching them to.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront plan*]</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Work] </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Worker] or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Object permissions</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Manage access to the object</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Attach reminder notifications to an object

1. In the left panel of the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** box that appears, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]**.

   If the [!DNL Workfront] administrator has created multiple reminder notifications, you can attach multiple notifications to a single object.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.
