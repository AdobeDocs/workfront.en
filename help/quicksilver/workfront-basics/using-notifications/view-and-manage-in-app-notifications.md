# View and manage in-app notifications

In-app notifications keep you informed about two types of information: announcement notifications and work item notifications. They are available from both the web application and the mobile application.

For a list of the work item and announcement notifications you can receive, see [In-app notifications overview](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/in-app-notifications-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]

>* In-app notifications for work activities are not tied to email notifications in [!DNL Workfront]. For more information, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront] notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/wf-notifications.md)
>* In-app notifications cannot be customized.
