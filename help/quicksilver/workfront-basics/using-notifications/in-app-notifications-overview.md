# In-app notifications overview

This article lists the in-app notifications you can receive. In-app notifications keep you informed about two types of information: announcement notifications and work item notifications. They are available from both the web application and the mobile application.

For instructions on how to view and manage these notifications, see [View and manage in-app notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/view-and-manage-in-app-notifications.md).

* [[!UICONTROL Announcement] notifications](#announcement-notifications)
* [[!UICONTROL Work item] notifications](#work-item-notifications)

## [!UICONTROL Announcement] notifications 

Announcements come in one of two ways:

* [!DNL Workfront] sends a message to the [!UICONTROL Announcement] page of your organization's [!DNL Workfront] administrators
* A [!DNL Workfront] administrator sends a message to users from the [!UICONTROL Announcement] page

In both cases, when the administrator or user clicks the numbered icon ![Notifications icon](assets/notifications-icon-jewel.jpg) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Workfront] to open their list of notifications, the subject line of the message displays with a megaphone icon ![Annoucement icon](assets/announcement.png) and the word "[!UICONTROL Announcement]."

For information about the [!UICONTROL Announcements] page, see [View and manage in-app notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/view-and-manage-in-app-notifications.md).

## [!UICONTROL Work item] notifications 

When you click the numbered icon ![Notifications icon](assets/notifications-icon-jewel.jpg) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Workfront] to open your list of notifications, the subject line of the work item message displays with an icon and brief description to identify what it's about. The icon and description types are listed below.
