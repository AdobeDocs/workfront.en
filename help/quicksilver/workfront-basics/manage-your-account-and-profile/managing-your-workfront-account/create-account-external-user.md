# Create an account in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] as an external user

You may be invited to view or approve work in [!DNL Workfront] even though you are not a member of a [!DNL Workfront] organization. For example, you may be requested to review or approve documents. You can view or approve these items more easily by creating an account in [!DNL Workfront].

When a user in [!DNL Workfront] makes a request for you to review or approve a document, <!--or shares a Workfront object such as a report or Board with you, -->you receive an email. Clicking the link in the email takes you directly to the item that was shared with you.

Creating an account in [!DNL Workfront] allows you to see all items shared with or requested from you. Without an account, you can access these items only through the individual email links.

## Create an account

1. On the asset page, click **Finish Account Setup** in the document header.

1. Fill in the **Password** section.
