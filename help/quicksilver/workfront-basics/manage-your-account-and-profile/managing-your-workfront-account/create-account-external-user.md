# Create an account [!DNL Adobe Workfront] as an external user

You may be invited to view or approve work in [!DNL Workfront] even though you are not a member of a [!DNL Workfront] organization. For example, you may be requested to review or approve documents. You can view or approve these items more easily by creating an account in [!DNL Workfront].

When a user in Workfront makes a request for you to review or approve a document, <!--or shares a Workfront object such as a report or Board with you, -->you receive an email. Clicking the link in the email takes you directly to the item that was shared with you.

If you want to see all items shared with or requested from you without locating individual email links, you can create an account in Workfront. 

## Create an account

You can create an account while viewing any asset that has been shared with you.

1. On the asset page, click Create account near the top of the screen.

1. Fill in the Password section. 

   For details, see [Password](#password).

1. (Optional) Fill in the Profile section.

   For details, see [Profile](#profile).


When presented with the Create an account page, fill in the following information.

### Password

>[!NOTE]
>
>The username for your Workfront account is your email address.

Create a new password for your account

Passwords must be at least 8 characters long and include two or more of the following:

* Uppercase letters
* Lowercase letters
* Numbers
* Special characters

### Profile

Creating a profile is optional but recommended. Your name and image make it easier for other users to, for example, see that it is you who has assigned to approve a given document, or find you in a list when assigning reviewers.

## Log in to Workfront

After you have created your account, you can log into Workfront using the domain of the organization that sent you the request.
