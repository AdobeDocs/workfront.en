# Log out of [!DNL Adobe Workfront]

For security reasons, it is important to log out of [!DNL Adobe Workfront] regularly. By default, [!DNL Workfront] automatically logs users out after 8 hours of inactivity.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Normally a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can change this amount of time to anywhere between 15 minutes and 7 days of inactivity, as explained in [Configure system security preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/configure-security-preferences.md), but this functionality is currently unavailable. We are working on authentication enhancements that will allow automatic log out after a specified period of inactivity.
