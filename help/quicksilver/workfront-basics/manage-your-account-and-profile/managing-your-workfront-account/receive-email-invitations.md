## Receive email invitations

When a Workfront administrator creates a new user, the new user may receive an invitation email based on several factors:

* Whether the user's organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console
* Whether the user was added in Workfront or the Admin Console
* Whether the user has access to other Adobe products or is a new Adobe user
* Whether the administrator chose to send the user an email invitation (only applies to organizations not yet on the Admin Console)

For more information about how a Workfront administrator sends email invitations while creating new users, see [Manage email invitations to new users](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/manage-email-invitations.md).

For more information about how a Workfront administrator adds new users to Adobe Workfront, see [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).
