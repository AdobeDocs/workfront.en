   If your organization has integrated [!DNL Workfront] with an SSO solution, you may be routed to reset your passwords through your SSO system when you click **[!UICONTROL Reset Password]**. This resets your SSO password which affects logging in to all your other applications inside your organization.

1. Type your old password, then type the new password you want twice.

   Your password must be at least 8 characters and contain two of the following types of characters:

   * Letters
   * Numbers
   * Special characters (i.e. ! @ # $ % etc.)

   Password rules might be more strict than this, depending on configuration settings set by your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.
