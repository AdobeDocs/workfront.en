# Reset a user's password with Enhanced Authentication

<!--This article has been hidden by request-->

When Enhanced Authentication (eAuth) is enabled for your [!DNL Workfront] Environment, a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can't reset login credentials for another user. This differs from [!DNL Workfront] environments without eAuth or those environments for which Single Sign On (SSO) is enabled.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p> Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>System administrator </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.
