# Reset a user's password with Enhanced Authentication

When Enhanced Authentication (eAuth) is enabled for your Workfront Environment, a Workfront administrator can’t reset login credentials for another user. This differs from Workfront environments without eAuth or those environments for which Single Sign On (SSO) is enabled.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan</p> </td>
