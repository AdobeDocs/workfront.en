# Configure personal time off in Adobe Workfront

Adobe Workfront is&nbsp;not designed to replicate or replace your existing systems for managing, accruing, and tracking personal time off.

However, it is important to indicate when approved time off happens, because this affects&nbsp;your schedule&nbsp;and impacts the Planned Completion Dates of the tasks you&nbsp;are assigned to.

For example, if you are assigned to a task that is scheduled to take two weeks, and you plan to take three days off during that time, Workfront adds three days to the task timeline to account for the time off.

Resource Management tools also use your personal time off to indicate when you are available to be scheduled for work.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To ensure that no inconsistencies occur with the dates that you schedule your time off for, we recommend that your user profile's time zone matches that of your schedule. For more information, see the following articles:

>* [Create a schedule](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md) 
>* [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md)

1. In the left panel, click **Time Off**.
1. Select the desired date for your personal time off. 
1. Select&nbsp;**All day**, if you are taking a full day off.  
   Leave it unselected&nbsp;if you are taking less than a full day off and indicate the start and end times of your time off.
