Your [!DNL Adobe Workfront] profile contains information about yourself (for example, your name, email address, address, phone number, title, etc). It also contains information about your interactions with [!DNL Workfront] and other users in your company (for example, your notifications settings, the tabs you want to display in [!DNL Workfront], or your job role, manager and group and team memberships).

Most of this information has already been set by your [!DNL Workfront] administrator when your [!DNL Workfront] account was created.

Depending on what access level you have in [!DNL Workfront], you can edit some of this information by configuring your [!UICONTROL My Settings] area.

## How access levels affect editing the [!UICONTROL My Settings] area

Depending on what access level you have, you may or may not be able to edit sections in your [!UICONTROL My Settings] area.

Some fields contained in editable sections cannot be edited, depending on other settings that might or might not be configured in your access level. For more information on additional access needed for editing some of the fields you find in [!UICONTROL My Settings], see the sections in [Configuring the [!UICONTROL My Settings] area](#configuring-the-my-settings-area).

To find out what access level you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

The following grid shows what sections in the [!UICONTROL My Settings] area are visible or editable depending on your access level:

### [!UICONTROL Resource Planning] 

Your resource planning information affects the timeline of work assignments, the time you log, cost, and revenue of the projects you are on. Usually, this area is updated by the [!DNL Workfront] administrator, a project or resource manager, or by your direct manager.

Use any of the following in this section:
