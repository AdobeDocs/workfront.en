# Get started with Adobe Workfront View

You can keep track of the progress on your projects when you are on the go by using the Adobe Workfront View mobile app.

Workfront View is a reporting tool. You cannot make changes or complete work using the Workfront View app. You can only view the status of your projects. It is intended for Project or Portfolio Managers, and other project stakeholders to connect to a high level interface for monitoring their projects.

If you must complete work, you must use the Workfront mobile app which is available on iOS and Android phones.

## Supported devices and access levels

The Workfront View app is supported only for iPads.

You must have the following access in Workfront to access information in Workfront View and perform the steps in this article:
