   * **[!UICONTROL Task Condition]**: Displays all the tasks in the project by [!UICONTROL Condition] in a pie chart.
   * **[!UICONTROL Issues]**: Displays the timeline of all issues in a line chart. The number of open issues is indicated in parentheses.
   * **[!UICONTROL Hours]**: Displays the [!UICONTROL Actual] and [!UICONTROL Planned Hours] on the tasks of the project in a combined line chart.
