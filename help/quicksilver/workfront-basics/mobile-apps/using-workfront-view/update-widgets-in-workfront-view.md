1. Select from the following widgets:

   * **[!UICONTROL Task Condition]**: Displays all the tasks in the project by [!UICONTROL Condition] in a pie chart.
   * **[!UICONTROL Issues]**: Displays the timeline of all issues in a line chart. The number of open issues is indicated in parentheses.
   * **[!UICONTROL Hours]**: Displays the [!UICONTROL Actual] and [!UICONTROL Planned Hours] on the tasks of the project in a combined line chart.
   * **[!UICONTROL Issue]** [!UICONTROL Status]: Displays all issues by Status in a pie chart.
   * **[!UICONTROL Updates]**: Displays all updates and comments on the project.

The first 6 tasks will be the tasks listed in the Workfront View mobile app in the [!UICONTROL Upcoming] Tasks widget.

   * **[!UICONTROL Remaining Tasks]**: Displays the incomplete tasks in a line chart.
   * **[!UICONTROL Documents]**: Displays a list of documents attached to the project.\
