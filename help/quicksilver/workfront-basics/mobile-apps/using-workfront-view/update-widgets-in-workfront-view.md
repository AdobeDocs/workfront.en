      * first, by the Estimated Due Date
      * secondly, by Work Breakdown Structure

     It displays the last two complete tasks (if applicable) and next 4 tasks. To understand what tasks will be displayed in the Workfront View mobile app, you can build a task report for the project you are viewing and sort it by the Estimated Due Date and then by the Workfront Breakdown Structure. The first 6 tasks will be the tasks listed in the Workfront View mobile app in the Upcoming Tasks widget.
   
   * **Remaining Tasks**: Displays the incomplete tasks in a line chart.
   * **Documents**: Displays a list of documents attached to the project.  
     You can open the following document formats with Workfront View:
