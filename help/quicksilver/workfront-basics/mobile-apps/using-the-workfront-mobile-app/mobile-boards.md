# [!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Boards] for mobile

[!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Boards] are flexible tools that allow team collaboration by providing access to a shared board that contains columns and cards. For additional information about boards, see [Boards overview](/help/quicksilver/agile/boards-overview.md).

In the [!DNL Workfront] mobile app, you can see all of the boards you created or have been added to in the desktop version of [!DNL Workfront]. You can't create a new board in the mobile app.

Any changes you make to board columns and cards in the app are also reflected in the desktop version of the board.

To provide feedback on mobile boards, select the **[!UICONTROL Send]** ![Send feedback](assets/mobile-send-feedback-icon.png) icon at the top of any board and follow the prompts.

>[!NOTE]
>
>At this time, the mobile app supports all types of boards **except** Iteration Process boards.

## View and filter the list of boards

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Boards**] on the home page to view a list of all boards you created or have been added to in the desktop version of [!DNL Workfront].

## View board contents

When you open a board, its columns and cards appear. Scroll horizontally to view all of the columns, and scroll vertically to view all of the cards in a column.

Select and hold a card to move it to another column.

If the board contains an intake column, it appears as the left-most column. Cards in the intake column are not editable until you move them into other board columns. You can select a card to open the task or issue. The intake column filters are controlled in the desktop version of the board. For more information, see [Add an intake column to a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/add-intake-column-to-board.md).

## Work with connected cards

A connected card is connected to an existing task or issue in [!DNL Workfront]. In the mobile app, a connected card is designated with the ![Connected card icon](assets/mobile-boards-connected-card-icon.png) icon. In the image below, the second card is a connected card.

When any one of the following details is updated for the card in one location, it is automatically updated in the other location:

* [!UICONTROL Name]
* [!UICONTROL Description]
* [!UICONTROL Assignees]
* [!UICONTROL Status]

For example, if you update the name of a connected card on a board in the mobile app, it is also updated on the task or issue.
