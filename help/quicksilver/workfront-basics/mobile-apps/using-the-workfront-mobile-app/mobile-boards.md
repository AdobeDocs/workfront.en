# [!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Boards] for mobile

[!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Boards] are flexible tools that allow team collaboration by providing access to a shared board that contains columns and cards. For additional information about boards, see [Boards overview](/help/quicksilver/agile/boards-overview.md).

In the [!DNL Workfront] mobile app, you can see all of the boards you created or have been added to in the desktop version of [!DNL Workfront]. You can't create a new board in the mobile app.

Any changes you make to board columns and cards in the app are also reflected in the desktop version of the board.
