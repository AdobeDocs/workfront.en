# Comment on proofs in iOS

You can review and resolve existing comments on a proof, and add new comments and annotations to the proof document.

Your access to comment on proofs is the same as in Adobe Workfront. For information about proofing capabilities, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the proof owner has locked the proof, you cannot comment on it. For more information, see [Lock and unlock a proof](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md#lock) in the article [Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md).

## Review existing comments in a proof

You can review comments that are made on a proof document. Comments often have associated drawings to call out the area of the document the comment refers to. Drawings can include arrows, lines, rectangles, highlighting, and freehand drawings.

1. Open the document proof. For information, see [Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md).
1. Select a comment icon on the document page ![Comment icon on document](assets/mobile-comment-icon-on-proofdoc-30x34.png) to open the comment and any associated drawings and attachments.

   If the comment has more than one reply, you can select **View Replies** to show all replies, or swipe the comment sheet up and down to display more content.

1. To view an attachment on the comment, select the comment thumbnail. Follow the prompts to download the attachment file to your device.
1. To reply to the comment, type your response in the text box underneath the comment and select the **Send** icon ![Send icon](assets/mobile-send-icon-25x26.png).

### Use the comment list

1. To see a list of all comments in order by page number, select the comment icon ![Comment icon](assets/mobile-comment-icon-30x25.png) on the top right.

   The number of unread comments is indicated on the comment icon. ![Number of unread comments](assets/mobile-unread-comments-icon-30x27.png) Unread comments in the list are marked with a blue dot. Comments with attachments have a paper clip icon ![Attachment icon](assets/mobile-paper-clip-icon.png).

1. In the list, select an individual comment to see the comment and its associated drawings on the document page.
1. Select the X to close the comment list and return to the proof.

### Take action on comments

In the comment list, you can perform different actions such as resolving a comment or marking it as read.

1. Select comments:

   * Press and hold an individual comment to select it.
   * Choose **Select** on the top right to display a check box next to each comment. Then, tap the comment check boxes or choose **Select All** on the top left.

1. To resolve the selected comment, select ![Resolve comment icon](assets/mobile-resolvecomment-icon-30x30.png) in the bottom toolbar.

   You can only resolve one comment at a time. The comment is marked with a green icon to show it was resolved.

   The original comment remains on the document. A comment resolution appears as a reply to the original comment: "This thread was resolved by [name]."

   You can undo the resolution by selecting the resolved comment and selecting the **Undo** icon.

1. To mark the selected comments as read, select the **Mark as read** icon ![Mark as read](assets/mobile-markread-icon-30x31.png) in the bottom toolbar.

   This option is only available when you have unread comments selected.

1. To delete the selected comments, select the **Delete** icon ![](assets/delete-30x28.png) in the bottom toolbar. Then, select **Delete** on the confirmation message to permanently delete the comment.

## Comment on a proof

You can associate your proof comments to a specific area on the document. Use the drawing tools to select an area to comment on.

1. Open the document proof. For information, see [Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md).
1. Select a drawing tool from the toolbar at the bottom of the proof screen.

   If you do not see the tool you need, scroll the toolbar to the right.

   The contact will receive an email notification when the comment is added to the proof.
