# Approvals in the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] mobile app

You can manage approvals assigned or delegated to you from the [!UICONTROL Approvals] area in the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] mobile app. From the [!UICONTROL approvals] area, you can approve:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Work (Tasks and Issues)</li> 
     <li>Documents</li> 
     <li>Proofs </li> 
    </ul> </td> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Timesheets</li> 
     <li>Access Requests</li> 
    </ul> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
