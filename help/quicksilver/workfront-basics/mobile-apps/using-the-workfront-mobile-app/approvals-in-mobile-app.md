# Approvals in the Adobe Workfront mobile app

You can manage approvals assigned or delegated to you from the Approvals area in the Adobe Workfront mobile app. From the approvals area, you can approve:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Work (Tasks and Issues)</li> 
     <li>Documents</li> 
     <li>Proofs </li> 
    </ul> </td> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Timesheets</li> 
     <li>Access Requests</li> 
    </ul> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

Proofs follow a separate approval process. You cannot approve a proof from a work item or document approval. For information on reviewing and approving proofs, see [Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md).
