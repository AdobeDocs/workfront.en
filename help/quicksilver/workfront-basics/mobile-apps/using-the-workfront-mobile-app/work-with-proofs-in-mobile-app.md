# Review and make decisions on proofs in the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] mobile app

When a proof is assigned to you for approval, it appears in your list of approvals in the mobile app. You can review the proof directly in the app and make a decision on it. For information about reviewing and approving proofs in [!DNL Adobe Workfront], see [Review proofs within [!DNL Adobe Workfront]](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

You can add comments to the proof and go through a revision process before making a final decision. For information about comments, see [Comment on proofs in [!DNL iOS]](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/comment-on-proofs-ios.md) or [Comment on proofs in [!DNL Android]](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/comment-on-proofs-android.md).

Your access to review and approve proofs is the same as in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]. For information about proofing capabilities, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in [!DNL Workfront Proof]](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).

## Open and review a proof
