# Export a list

You can export a list of objects from Adobe Workfront. When the list of objects in Workfront contains more than 2000 items, exporting the list is the only way to review all items in the list on one page.

For information on export formats and limits, see [Export data](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/export-data.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td>

   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td>
