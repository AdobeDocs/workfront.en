# Understand the navigation for a Work-license user

The  Main Menu  changes with the access level you have been assigned by your Adobe Workfront administrator. By default, you are given access only to the areas that include functionality allowed by your access level. To understand the components of the default layout of each access level, see [About the default Adobe Workfront layout](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/about-the-default-wf-layout.md).

## Understand the default  Main Menu  of a Worker

As a Worker, your main responsibility is to complete work. The areas in the  Main Menu  that are visible to you allow you to do that.

The following areas are included in the default layout of a Worker:

* **Home**: Tasks and issues assigned to you display here. This is the default landing page for a Worker , however, it doesn't appear in the Main Menu unless a Workfront administrator adds it in the layout template .  For information, see [Get started with Home](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/get-started-with-home.md). 

* **Projects**: Projects that are shared with you display here. For information, see [Projects](../../../manage-work/projects/projects-overview.md). 

* **Report** s : Reports that are shared with you display here. For information, see [Reports](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reports-overview.md). 

* **Dashboards**:&nbsp;Dashboards that are shared with you display here. For information, see [Dashboards](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/dashboards-overview.md).

* **Calendars**: Calendars that are shared with you display here. For information, see [Calendars](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/calendars.md). 

* **Teams**: Tasks and issues assigned to your teams display in this area. As a Worker, you are the only Workfront user who sees the Teams area by default.

  <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
  This area is named "
  Users
  " for users with a Plan license. As a Worker, you cannot edit users, so the
  Users
  area is not available to you. You can see the work assigned to your Teams, however, and this is why this
  area
  is more accurately renamed to "Teams."
  </MadCap:conditionalText>

  For information, see [Create and manage teams](../../../people-teams-and-groups/create-and-manage-teams/create-and-mange-teams.md). 

* **Requests**: You can submit requests and review requests you or your team members have submitted here. For information, see [Requests](../../../manage-work/requests/requests-overview.md).

  <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE:&nbsp;from&nbsp;Alina: originally, we messaged that this is not on for Workers by default because it was believed that they need a layout template to see Boards; however, in this issue, Jake Turpin said it's not required to have it in a template: https://hub.workfront.com/issue/6256c241000127cb28186b5bfa17aaa0?email-source=comm)</p>
  -->

* **Blueprints**: Review existing blueprints in your system and request one to be installed, if the Workfront administrator configured the request queue for blueprints.&nbsp;For more information, see [Blueprints overview](../../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-overview.md).
