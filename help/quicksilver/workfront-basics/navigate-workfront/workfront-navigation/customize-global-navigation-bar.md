# Customize the Main Menu in Adobe Workfront

The Main Menu changes with the access level you have been assigned by your Adobe Workfront administrator. By default, you are given access only to the areas of the Main Menu that include functionality allowed by your access level. To understand the components of the default layout of each access level, see [About the default Adobe Workfront layout](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/about-the-default-wf-layout.md).

You can customize the Main Menu to better fit your needs and your workflow.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Review or higher</p> <p>Note: Users with a Request license can access their profiles and see the Global Nav Bar field, but the only option is Requests and it cannot be removed.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>
