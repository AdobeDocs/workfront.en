# [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience] FAQ

The [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience] for [!DNL Workfront] allows you to manage all of your [!DNL Adobe] applications in one place with a single login. The [!DNL Adobe] navigation area is integrated seamlessly with [!DNL Workfront]. A few features are different, and you might have some questions as your [!DNL Workfront] instance is migrated to the unified experience.

For information about how to log in to the [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience], see [[!DNL Adobe Unified Experience] for [!DNL Workfront]](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/adobe-unified-experience.md).

## Comparison of [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience] and [!DNL Workfront only] experience

Only customers using the [!DNL Adobe Business Platform] / [!DNL Adobe Admin Console] can access the [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience]. Customers who have not yet migrated will see the [!DNL Workfront only] experience, without the ability to switch between [!DNL Adobe] applications.

### How are you handling [!DNL Adobe Admin Console] for companies that already have this enabled for federated IDs differently than [!DNL Workfront] SSO is set up?

[!DNL Adobe Admin Console] has the option to include [!DNL Workfront], replacing SSO with IMS. All user provisioning happens in the [!DNL Admin Console], and users will see the [!DNL Adobe] login screen to get to [!DNL Experience Cloud] where they will see [!DNL Workfront] as an option (if they are granted access to it).

### How does this impact customers that already have the AEM admin panel for [!DNL Adobe Assets] â€“ but the SSO is configured differently than [!DNL Workfront?]

Once [!DNL Workfront] is added as an [!DNL Admin Console] application, you should not have to do anything else for [!DNL Workfront] to leverage the existing SSO setup you have for [!DNL Adobe Assets].

### How does this affect those that are set up with SSO?

SSO is set up in the [!DNL Admin Console] and inherited by the [!DNL Workfront] application.

### Is SSO with our internal [!DNL Active Directory] still going to be an option with IMS?

IMS is a replacement for SSO and functions mostly the same. All user permissions are granted and provisioned in [!DNL Adobe Admin Console], and the user will see the [!DNL Adobe] login screen where they can choose "[!UICONTROL Personal Account]" or "[!UICONTROL Company Account]" to log in (if you have [!DNL Active Directory], most will log in with a company account).

### For those that are not using SSO, does the [!DNL Workfront] login URL change?

The login URL will change; however, the old URL will redirect to the new login URL, so you should retrain your users where to go.

### Will aliases we have set up still work, or are the [!DNL Workfront] links changing with this migration?

[!DNL Workfront] redirects/aliases are available to get to the homepage.

### Will there be a time when the redirects are disabled? Or will we always be able to type in my.company.workfront.com?

You'll always be able to use any custom URLs. After you click any of those links, it will direct you to [!DNL Workfront] and show a different URL. However, it is a better [!DNL experience] to log in to experience.adobe.com, and bookmark links from within [!DNL Experience Cloud]. Less redirecting equals less lag time/loading time.

### Will direct links to request queues be broken?

All direct links should redirect to the new URL patterns. However, if you have distributed links to people, you should send an update to leverage the direct link and prevent delays in getting to the expected page.

### Will we migrate to [!DNL Experience Cloud] globally or can we select for certain users (not all our users even use other Adobe products)?

The entire [!DNL Workfront] customer account will be migrated. It cannot be done on a user-by-user basis.

### Will all [!DNL Workfront] users have to log in via [!DNL Experience Cloud]? Or just administrators?

Yes, all users will log in via [!DNL Experience Cloud]. The IMS login will replace SSO. It's a very similar experience, just a different login screen.

### Will users have to link their [!DNL Adobe] accounts to their [!DNL Workfront] accounts if they already have both?

Yes, there is a process for this, and more details will be provided when it's time for your organization to move to IMS.

### What happens to the [!DNL Workfront] users who don't have an [!DNL Adobe] account?

Users who haven't been granted access in [!DNL Adobe Admin Console] to get into [!DNL Workfront] must create a "[!UICONTROL personal account]" or an [!DNL Adobe] ID account to be able to log in. This sends an email to the administrator to approve or reject their request, and it additionally enables the admin to configure what type of access that user has. When they log in, they will go to experience.adobe.com, enter their email address, and choose [!UICONTROL Personal Account]. From there, they will be able to access [!DNL Workfront].

### What if we don't have any [!DNL Adobe] products other than [!DNL Workfront?]

It is still recommended that your organization migrate to the [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience]. You will receive an [!DNL Adobe] ID along with the benefits listed above.

### We have external users included in our [!DNL Workfront] instance. We wouldn't want them to have access to any other products included in [!DNL Adobe]. How would we limit their access within the console?

[!DNL Admin Console] gives admins a lot of control over what users can and cannot access. Whenever an external user wants access, they need to create an [!DNL Adobe] ID, which sends an email to the administrator. The administrator can then accept or reject access to a product and define what they can/cannot access for products owned by that organization. Then, the [!DNL Workfront] System Administrator can go into the [!UICONTROL Users] area of [!DNL Workfront] to make any more granular permissions for the external user.

### Group Admins are used to create people in [!DNL Workfront]. With the move to [!DNL Experience Cloud], will group admins still be able to create people?

Yes, user creation is still possible through [!DNL Workfront]. Those users can be added to [!DNL Experience Cloud] automatically. You can also set up your group admins as product owners in the [!DNL Admin Console] to allow them to assign [!DNL Workfront] to users.

### What is the deadline to switch over to [!DNL Experience Cloud]?

There is no deadline currently to move to [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud]. We're working with customers to let them choose when they're ready to make the move.

### Will our support team need to do anything for this change?

If the support team is responsible for creating new users, then they will need to become familiar with the [!DNL Admin Console] interfaces used to create users and assign an entitlement to Workfront. Otherwise, there is likely no significant change for your internal support team.

### How does this impact integrations we have through the API function?

The existing URL path will continue to be available for API traffic. You should not need to do anything to update the endpoints in your integrations. However, direct login through username and password will not be supported â€“ you must use an API key, with the exception being [!DNL Workfront Fusion] connectors.

### What about [!DNL Creative Cloud] users? How does the migration affect them? Are there any advantages for them?

There is no impact to [!DNL Creative Cloud] users with the migration to [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience].

### Will logins change for [!DNL Workfront] mobile users?

[!DNL Workfront] mobile users should not be affected by the migration to [!DNL Adobe Unified Experience].
