   <td> <p>Allocation Date</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>You can find this field in the following types of reports:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Resource Estimates</li> 
     <li>Project (Financial Data)</li> 
     <li>Budgeted Hour</li> 
    </ul> <p>For a Resource Estimates or Project (Financial Data) report: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Build these reports when trying to understand how resources are budgeted for work, or the amount of Planned Hours that is assigned to your resources.</li> 
     <li> <p>The Allocation Date is the first day (Sunday) of a week in which the allocation of a Job Role to a task starts. A resource (Job Role) can have as many Allocation Dates as it has weeks during the Duration of the tasks that it is assigned to. If tasks span over multiple months, then the first day of a month can also become an Allocation Date, if it falls within the Duration of the task.&nbsp;</p> <p>For example, you can have a Job Role assigned to a task that spans over 3 weeks and has 90 Planned Hours. These hours are spread evenly during the duration of the task, which makes every day assign 6 Planned Hours to your job role:</p> <p><em> Daily Planned Hours = Total Planned Hours/ Number of Work Days during the Duration of the task </em> </p> <p>As a result, there are three Allocation Dates, one for every Sunday of every week during the Duration of the task, each with a certain number of Planned Hours associated with them.<br>If the task starts in the middle of the last week of a month and ends two weeks after the beginning of a new month, the task will have four Allocation Dates: one for every Sunday of every week during the Duration of the task, and one for the first day of the new month.</p> <p>To make the most use of this information, we recommend that you build a Resource Estimates or a Project (Financial Data) report and add a matrix grouping for Allocation Date, and group the results weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly for the most accurate data.<br>For information about building a matrix grouping, see the article <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-matrix-report.md" class="MCXref xref">Create a matrix report</a>.</p> </li>

     <p>For a Budgeted Hour report:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Build this report when trying to understand the amount of Budgeted Hours that is allocated to your resources or to your projects in the Resource Planner.</li> 
      <li> <p>The Allocation Date is the first day (a Sunday) of the week for which you budgeted the hours in the Resource Planner. </p> <p>Tip:   <p>If a week spans for two months, it will generate two rows in the report: one corresponding to the first day of the week (Sunday of the first week which is during the first month), and the second row displays the first day of the second month. </p> <p>For example, if you budget 8 hours for a user for the week of June 30 (Sunday) - July 6 (Saturday), the two rows show an Allocation Date of June 30, and July 1. </p> </p> <p>For information about budgeting resources in the Resource Planner, see the article <a href="../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/budget-resources-project-role-views-resource-planner.md" class="MCXref xref">Budget resources in the Resource Planner using the Project and Role views</a>.</p> </li>
