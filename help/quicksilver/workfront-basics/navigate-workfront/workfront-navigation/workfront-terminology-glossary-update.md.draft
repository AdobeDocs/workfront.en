# Glossary of Adobe Workfront terminology

**Important:** This article should be used as a reference to understand the terms that you may encounter in the Adobe Workfront application, in the Workfront documentation, or when generally speaking about planning and managing work. We are currently updating this information and as a result this table might not be complete. We will remove this disclaimer when we consider this information exhaustive. 

The following table is a list of commonly used terms in Adobe Workfront:

A - C
-----

 

Object Name

Description

Access Level

A user profile that determines how a user can interact with different objects and tools within Workfront.

Active Task

An incomplete task in a current project that is not prevented from being worked on by a predecessor task and does not have a task constraint with a future planned start date. In other words, it can be worked on today.

Activity

In Workfront Goals, an activity is a progress indicator for a goal. It can be a progress bar that you update manually, or a project that is associated with the goal. You cannot display activities in a report and you cannot access them through the Workfront API. For information about activities, see Get started with results and activities in Adobe Workfront Goals.

Actual Cost

For tasks and issues, this is the cost associated with the actual hours logged in relation to the Cost per hour rate of the resource assigned to the task or issue. For projects, this is a total of all Actual Costs from tasks and issues on the project. For information, see Track costs.

Actual Expense Cost

The sum of the Actual Amounts for all expenses logged for a project or a task.

**Example:** If you create an expense for Task 1 and enter $600.00 in the Actual Amount field, the Actual Expense Cost for this task is $600.00.

For a project, Workfront uses the following formula to calculate Actual Expense Cost:

`Project Actual Expense Cost = SUM (All Project Actual Expense Costs) + SUM (All Tasks Actual Expense Costs)`  

**Important:** If the value in the Actual Amount field for an expense is negative, Workfront will ignore that expense record. For example, if the value in the Planned Amount field is $200.00 but the value in the Actual Amount field is -$300.00, the system will ignore this entire expense record which means you would not include the $200.00 planned value or the -$300.00 actual value in any calculations for Planned Expense Cost or Actual Expense Cost. (drafting this because not sure if this is still correct)

Actual Hours

In a project, task, or issue report, Actual Hours are the sum of all hours logged on the project, task, or issue. 

**Example:** If from the Updates tab for Task 1, you click ‘Log Time’ and enter 25 hours, the Actual Hours of Task 1 = 25 hours.

Workfront calculates Actual Hours for parent tasks or projects using the following formulas:

*   `For parent tasks = children Actual Hours + Actual Hours on the parent task.`
    
*   `For projects = Actual Hours logged on the project + Actual Hours logged on standalone or children tasks in the project`
    

Actual Labor Cost

The Actual Cost associated with the labor invested in a task or a project.

For a task, Workfront calculates the Actual Labor Cost using the following formula:

`Task Actual Labor Cost = Number of Actual Hours on the task * User or Job Role Hourly Cost Rate`

**Note:** If the task has a Cost Type of User Hourly, Workfront uses the user rate. If the task has a Cost Type of Role Hourly, Workfront uses the job role rate to calculate Actual Labor Cost.

For a project, Workfront uses the following formula to calculate the Actual Labor Cost:

`Project Actual Labor Cost = SUM(All Tasks Actual Labor Cost)`

For more information, see Track costs.

**Example:** For example, if a user logs 5 hours for a task with a User Hourly Cost Type and their hourly rate is $100, the Actual Labor Cost is $500.

  

Actual Revenue

The Actual Revenue of a project or a task is the amount of money associated with the Actual Hours of the project or the task.

For information about tracking revenue in Workfront see Overview of Billing and Revenue.

Actual Start

The timestamp when a user changes an object in in-progress on work assigned to them.

Ad hoc

A type of work process that is unplanned.

Additional Schedules

An additional preset to be used for a new user group.

Agile Methodology

A type of methodology based on the collaborative evolution of needs and solutions with cross-functional teams. It encourages flexibility and change based on a fixed timeline.

Agile Team

Differ from traditional team because they take their prospective work from a backlog and work on it within a set period of time that is called an Iteration.

All My Teams

When this is referenced in filters, this field displays either users that belong to the any of the teams that the logged-in user belongs to, or work items assigned to any of the teams that the logged-in user belongs to.

We recommend using this field in a filter to make reports more generic when sharing them with other users. This way, you can build only one report which will display different information depending on who logs in to view it, as the information is always customized for the logged-in user.

Allocation Date

You can find this field in the following types of reports:

*   Resource Estimates
*   Project (Financial Data)
*   Budgeted Hour

For a Resource Estimates or Project (Financial Data) report:

*   Build this report when trying to understand how resources are budgeted for work, or the amount of Planned Hours that is assigned to your resources.
*   The Allocation Date is the first day (Sunday) of a week in which the allocation of a Job Role to a task starts. A resource (Job Role) can have as many Allocation Dates as it has weeks during the Duration of the tasks that it is assigned to. If tasks span over multiple months, then the first day of a month can also become an Allocation Date, if it falls within the Duration of the task. 
    
    For example, you can have a Job Role assigned to a task that spans over 3 weeks and has 90 Planned Hours. These hours are spread evenly during the duration of the task, which makes every day assign 6 Planned Hours to your job role:
    
    _Daily Planned Hours = Total Planned Hours/ Number of Work Days during the Duration of the task_
    
    As a result, there are three Allocation Dates, one for every Sunday of every week during the Duration of the task, each with a certain number of Planned Hours associated with them.  
    If the task starts in the middle of the last week of a month and ends two weeks after the beginning of a new month, the task will have four Allocation Dates: one for every Sunday of every week during the Duration of the task, and one for the first day of the new month.
    
    To make the most use of this information, we recommend that you build a Resource Estimates or a Project (Financial Data) report and add a matrix grouping for Allocation Date, then group the results weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly for the most accurate data.  
    For information about building a matrix grouping, see the article Create a matrix report.
    

**Warning:** Financial information populates in Project (Financial Data) reports only when the data associated with it is less than 5 years old. For example, if a job role was allocated to a task in January 2015 and today is September 2021, a financial filed like the Allocation Date for the job role does not populate in the Project (Financial Data) report.

For a Budgeted Hour report:

*   Build this report when trying to understand the amount of Budgeted Hours that is allocated to your resources or to your projects in the Resource Planner.
*   The Allocation Date is the first day (a Sunday) of the week for which you budgeted the hours in the Resource Planner.
    
    **Tips:**
    
    If a week spans for two months, it will generate two rows in the report: one corresponding to the first day of the week (Sunday of the first week which is during the first month), and the second row displays the first day of the second month.
    
    For example, if you budget 8 hours for a user for the week of June 30 (Sunday) - July 6 (Saturday), the two rows show an Allocation Date of June 30, and July 1.
    
    For information about budgeting resources in the Resource Planner, see the article Budget resources in the Resource Planner using the Project and Role views.
    
    For information about building a Budgeted Hour report, see Report: Budgeted Hour.

For more information, see Create a Business Case for a project .

Business Case Budgeted Hours

This is a deprecated field. Any information that this field might display is related to a feature that Workfront has removed. This field cannot be updated.

The field is still visible in project and task lists and reports.

Calculated Assignment

One of the task Duration Types. This will calculate the percentage of an 8-hour work day that the user assigned to the task will be allocated to the task, based on the Duration of the task and the Work Required.

For more information, see Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type.

Calculated Work

One of the task Duration Types. This will calculate the WOrk Required on a task, given the Duration and the user Assignment percentages (which are based on an 8-hour work day).

For more information, see Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type.

Calendar

There are two types of calendars in Workfront: the Home Calendar and calendar reports.

The Home Calendar is a personal calendar that allows a user to manage their workload against their available hours in Workfront. The user can also integrate their Home Calendar with Outlook (Google and Microsoft integration to come).

For more information about the Home Calendar, see Home Calendar view.

A calendar report is a dynamic report in which users can view the date and other important details of an event, including the due date, status of work, and the user to whom the event is assigned.

For more information about calendar reports, see Calendar reports overview.

Calendar Report

 

Can Start

This field indicates whether a task is ready to start to be worked on. If the start is ready to be worked on the Can Start field on the task is set to True.

For more information, see "Can Start" overview for tasks.

(NOTE: everything below is drafted because I created a new article linked above with all this information - it was getting kind of too big for just a table cell)

Workfront checks for the following things before it marks a task as True for the Can Start field:  

*   If the task has a parent, it checks to see if the value of Can Start for the parent it set to True. If the value for the parent is False, then all the subtasks have the value of Can Start set to False, as well. 
*   It also checks to see if the predecessors of the task as well as the predecessors of their parents are complete. If they are complete, the Can Start value for the task is set to True. If any of the task predecessors or their parents' predecessors are not complete, or have a status of Complete-Pending Approval, then the Can Start value for the task is set to False. 

For information about task predecessors, see Overview of task predecessors.

**Tip:** If the Dependency Type between a task and its predecessors is Start-Start, the predecessor must start before the predecessor relationship is considered resolved and the successor tasks can start. For information about dependency types, see Overview of task dependency types.

*   Start No Earlier Than

**Tips:**

*   A task with a Constraint of Fixed Dates has no Constraint Date.
    
*   Constraint Date is only viewable in a report or customized view.
    

Constraint Day

If you are using a Task Constraint in a template task that is tied to a specific day, such as Must Start On, then that specific day becomes the Constraint Day of the template task. 

The following task constraints update the Constraint Day field:

*   Must Start On
*   Must Finish On
*   Start No Later Than
*   Start No Earlier Than

**Tip:** Constraint Day is only viewable in a report or customized view.

Constraint Type

Object Name

Description

Parameter

A parameter is a custom field. You can build a report for all parameters, or custom fields in your system. 

Parent

In a report, this field shows information about the parent of the object. For example, in an issue report, it might show information about the task or project that the issue is logged under; in a task report, it might show information about the direct parent task or about the project. For more information about what objects might have parents in Workfront, see the "Interdependency and hierarchy of objects" section in the article Understand objects in Adobe Workfront.

Parent Lag

The amount of time that must pass between the Parent Task start and the Subtask Start.

Parent Task

Also known as a Summary Task. This is a task that has Subtasks (also called Children Tasks). The Duration, Work Required, and Percent Complete of the Parent Task is calculated from the Subtasks.

Part-Time Resources

A licensed user who has less capacity than the default schedule defined in the system.

Percent Complete

A project, task, or issue field that shows what percentage of the work associated with the task, project, or issue is completed.

You can update this field manually for issues and working tasks.

For projects and parent tasks, this field is a roll-up from all the working tasks and you cannot update it manually.

For more information, see Project Percent Complete overview.

Permission

Rights that are granted to a user on an object, typically given so they can complete work on the item or view the item. You can grant permissions to:

*   Projects
*   Tasks
*   Issues
*   Portfolios
*   Programs
*   Reports
*   Dashboards
*   Documents
*   Custom Forms
*   Views
*   Filters
*   Groupings

For more information, see Overview of sharing permissions on objects.

Plan

This is a full license type in the Workfront system. Users must have this to access all of the features in Workfront.

For more information, see Adobe Workfront licenses overview.

Plan (in the Scenario Planner)

A plan is the main object when working with the Workfront Scenario Planner. You can outline the strategy for your company's near and long-term future and identify each high-level outcome and add it as a plan to the Workfront Scenario Planner.

You cannot display Scenario Planner plans in a report and you cannot access them through the Workfront API.

The Scenario Planner is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience and requires an additional license. For information about the Workfront Scenario Planner, see The Scenario Planner overview.

Planned

The time frame within which something is scheduled to occur. When you create projects, tasks, or issues in Workfront, you establish the planned start and end dates, as well as the planned timeframe during which they occur. These values represent your original intention or estimate of how long a work time should take to complete.

The timestamp used to baseline task KPIs (NOTE: From Taxonomy)

Planned Benefit

This is a manual entry for the Project Manager to estimate whether completing a project would bring any monetary benefit to the organization. Specifying this value can be part of putting together a Business Case for the project. You must have Manage permissions to the project to update this value.

Planned Budgeted Hours

In a Budgeted Hour report, this displays the amount of hours budgeted for Projects or Job Roles in the Resource Planner.

For information about budgeting Projects or Roles in the Resource Planner, see the article Budget resources in the Resource Planner using the Project and Role views. For information about the Budgeted Hours report, see the article Report: Budgeted Hour.

Planned Completion Date

You can manually set the Planned Completion Date to a date of your choosing. If you do not set the Planned Completion Date, Workfront sets it automatically. When set automatically, the Planned Completion Date is: Planned Start Date + Duration

For more information, see the following articles:

*   Overview of the task Planned Completion Date
    
*   Set the project Planned Completion Date
    

Planned Cost

A total of the Planned Labor Cost and the Planned Expense Cost of the project. This does not include the Planned Risk Cost on the project.  

Planned Duration

A task's Planned Duration is usually the same as the task's Duration. It represents the difference in days between the Planned Start and the Planned Completion Dates of the task. 

When the task has a Duration Type of Effort Driven, the Planned Duration can differ from the Duration of the task, based on how many resources you assign to the task. 

For example, if a task with a Duration Type of Effort Driven has a Duration of 3 days and you assign one resource with a full time schedule to the task, the Planned Duration is 3 days, as well. If you assign three resources with a full time schedule to the same task, the Duration stays 3 days, but the Planned Duration becomes 1 day. The Planned Duration also changes the Planned Start and Planned Completion dates of the task, to reflect the new Planned Duration. As a result, the timeline of the project is affected as well. 

For more information about the difference between Duration and Planned Duration for tasks, see the article Difference between Planned Duration and Duration for tasks.

Projects and issues don't have a Planned Duration. 

Planned Duration Minutes

The Planned Duration Minutes of a project or an issue is the Duration of the project or issue in minutes. 

Tasks don't have a Planned Duration Minutes field. 

Template Tasks have a Planned Duration Minutes field which displays the Planned Duration of the task in minutes. 

Planned Expense Cost

The sum of the Planned Amounts for all expenses logged for a project or a task.

**Example:** If you create an expense for Task 1 and enter $600.00 in the Planned Amount field, the Planned Expense Cost for this task is $600.00.

For a project, Workfront uses the following formula to calculate Planned Expense Cost:

`Project Planned Expense Cost = SUM (All Project Planned Expense Costs) + SUM (All Tasks Planned Expense Costs)`

**Important:** If the value in the Actual Amount field for an expense is negative, Workfront will ignore that expense record. For example, if the value in the Planned Amount field is $200.00 but the value in the Actual Amount field is -$300.00, the system will ignore this entire expense record which means you would not include the $200.00 planned value or the -$300.00 actual value in any calculations for Planned Expense Cost or Actual Expense Cost. (Drafting this because not sure if this is correct anymore)

Planned Hours

This field appears in the projects, tasks, and issues areas, reports for projects, tasks, or issues, and resource management tools like the Resource Planner, Workload Balancer and the Utilization report.

It shows the amount of hours that the Project Owner estimates that each task or issue should take to complete. For projects, it is generally a roll-up of the Planned Hours from the tasks on the project.

The Planned Hours field might display different information depending on where you view it from. For information about Planned Hours, see Planned Hours overview.

**Note:** Planned Hours are stored in minutes in the Workfront database. When writing calculations using this field, ensure you account for the fact that the hours display as minutes.  

By default, Planned Hours are distributed equally to all the days within the duration of a work item and also equally for all resources assigned to the task. Users can update the daily amount of Planned Hours for a work item or the individual Planned Hours for each assignee.

Updating this field differs for projects, tasks, and issues:

*   For issues, you can manually update this field. Issue Planned Hours are not added to the Project Planned Hours. 
    
    **Tip:** In an issue report, one of the Planned Hours fields is replaced by the Work field. The field displays the number of Planned Hours on the issue. For more information, see the "work" or "Work" fields in this table.
    

*   For tasks, you can manually update this field when the Duration Type of the task is Calculated Assignment or Simple. This field is calculated by Workfront when the Duration Type of the task is Calculated Work or Effort Driven.  
    For information about Task Duration, see the article Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type.
    

*   For projects, Workfront calculates the Planned Hours by adding all Planned Hours from all the tasks on the project.
    

**Tip:** You can display Planned Hours in project, task, or issues reports also by using text mode and reference additional fields. For more information, see the "`work`", "Work", and "`workRequiredExpression`" fields in this table.

A baseline measurement for task KPI and a communication tool for the resource managers

(NOTE: above, From Taxonomy)

Planned Labor Cost

(NOTE: this is linked elsewhere)

For a task, the hourly rate of the user or role multiplied by the number of hours assigned to the user or role. 

For a project, it is a total of all Planned Labor Costs of all the tasks.  

Whether the rate of the user or role is used depends on the Cost Type that is selected for the given task.

For more information, see Track costs.

Planned Revenue

Tasks and projects can display a value for Planned Revenue in Workfront. Planned Revenue represents the amount of money associated with the Planned Hours of the tasks on the project. For projects, it can also include the Fixed Revenue of the project.

For tasks, this is the revenue associated with the Planned Hours of tasks. The Planned Hours from all tasks roll up to the Planned Hours of the project to contribute to the calculation of the project Planned Hours.

Workfront calculates Planned Revenue for tasks and projects using the following formulas:

`Task Planned Revenue = Planned Hours * Billing hourly rate`

`Project Planned Revenue = SUM (All tasks Planned Revenue) + Fixed Revenue`

(the note below is duplicated in this article: /Content/Resource Mgmt/Resource utilization/view-utilization-information.htm and in the glossary)

**Note:**

The project Planned Revenue that displays in the Project Details area and in project reports differs from the Planned Revenue that displays in the Utilization report.

The Planned Revenue in the Project Details area reflects the task revenue as well as the Fixed Revenue of the project. The Planned Revenue in the Utilization Report displays Planned Revenue associated only with the tasks in the project.

**Example:**

If the project has 1 task with 10 hours, assigned to a Consultant with $20 hourly rate, and the project has $100 Fixed Revenue, the Utilization report displays $200 for Planned Revenue (the Planned Revenue associated with the hours on the task). The Project Details section displays $300 (the Planned Revenue from the task and the Fixed Revenue for the project.)

For information about tracking revenue in Workfront see Overview of Billing and Revenue.

For information about Planned Revenue calculations in the Utilization report, see View resource utilization information .

Planned Risk Cost

The total of the Potential Cost of all the risks on the project factoring in their Probability of occurring. This amount is not included in the Planned Cost of the project.

The Planned Risk Cost of a project is calculated by the following formula:

`Planned Risk Cost = SUM(Potential Risk Cost * Probability / 100)`

*   Move the issue to a different Project or Queue through the routing rule set on the selected topic.

For more information, see Create Queue Topics.

Rank

In an Access Level report, you can manually indicate a Rank of the Access Level. This helps you, as the Workfront administrator, to visually identify the level of complexity associated with each Access Level. For example, you can give lower numbers for more complex (Plan-level) Access Levels, and higher numbers for less complex (Requester-level) Access Levels. You cannot rank the standard Access Levels. 

Ready

This field on a task report indicates whether an Agile task has been marked as Ready on the backlog. This flag only applies to Agile tasks, which are tasks assigned to an Agile team. 

Recurrence Frequency

A field that displays in the Task Details or the Edit Task box of a parent of recurring tasks. It is the frequency with which the tasks in the recurrence occur. For information about creating recurring tasks, see Create recurring tasks.

Reference Number

Projects, tasks, and issues are automatically associated with a unique reference number as they are created. You can view the Reference Number in the Details page of projects, tasks, or issues, or in a list or report.

**Tip:** You can defer to reference numbers when two items have the same name, as reference numbers are always unique.

Workfront automatically generates sequential reference number at the system level. Each project, task, or issue gets the next available number in the sequence.  

For example, if User A creates a task, Workfront might automatically assign the task the Reference Number of 100. If User B creates an issue right after this, Workfront assigns the issue the Reference Number of 101. You cannot manually edit Reference Numbers.

Rejection Issue

In a project or a task report, this is the issue that is created when the approval for the project or the task is rejected. For information about rejection issues, see the article Create an approval process for work items.

Risk

This may refer to the following concepts in Workfront:

*   A field on a project that indicates how risky a project can be. You can prioritize the execution of your projects based on the level of risk. Projects can have the following levels of risk:
    
    \- Very Low
    
    \- Low
    
    \- Medium
    
    \- High
    
    \- Very High
    
    **Note:** The levels of risks you indicate for a project cannot be customized.
    
    For information about updating the Risk of a project, see the "Project Settings" section of the article Edit projects. You can display the risk field of a project in reports.
    
*   An event that might occur during the life of a project that identifies a potential impact to the cost, scope, or schedule of the project. You define potential risks to a project and associate a probability of them occurring or a cost as you build the project's Business Case. For information about adding risks to the Business Case of the project, see Create and edit risks on projects.
    
    **Tip:** You cannot display risks defined in the Business Case in reports. You can only display several types of Risk Costs in reports and lists.
    

Risk Cost

The cost associated with the risks on a project. The following are risk costs associated with projects that you can display in reports:

*   Actual Cost: a field on a risk that shows the actual cost for the risk that has occurred. In addition to reports and lists, you can locate it in the Edit Risk box when editing or creating a risk.
    
    For project, task, or issue costs, see "Actual Cost" in this article.
    
*   Planned Risk Cost: a field on the project that shows a total of all Potential Risk Costs for the project. See also "Planned Risk Cost" in this article.
    
    For information about Potential Risk Cost, see Calculate Potential Risk Cost .
    
*   Remaining Risk Cost: a field on the project that displays the difference between the total of the Actual Costs of all risks and the Planned Risk Cost. See also "Remaining Risk Cost" in this article. See also "Remaining Risk Cost" in this article.
