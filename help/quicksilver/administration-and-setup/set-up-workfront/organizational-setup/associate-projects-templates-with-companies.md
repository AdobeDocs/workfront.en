# Associate projects and templates with companies

A project or a template cannot be associated with more than one company. But there is no limit to how many projects or templates you associate with one company.

One of the benefits of associating projects with companies is that you can report on project financials for each company.

## Access requirements

You must have the following in order to manage companies in Workfront:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <col data-mc-conditions=""> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Workfront plan*</p> </td> 
   <td>Team or higher</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront license*</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>One of the following:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p>The System Administrator access level, which allows you to edit any company in the system. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>. </p> </li>

    </ul> <p>Note:  
     <ul>

        <li> <p>In your access level, Edit must be selected for the Users setting. And, for the Users setting, under Fine-tune your settings <img src="assets/gear-icon-in-access-levels.png"> , the Create option and at least one of the two User Admin options must be enabled. </p> <p>If you are using the User Admin (Group Users) option, you must be a group administrator of a group where the user is a member.</p> <p> <img src="assets/access-req-users-350x101.png" style="width: 350;height: 101;"> </p> </li> 
       </ul> <p>For information about the Users setting in an access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-other-users.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to users</a>.</p> </li> 
     </ul> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>

## Associate a template with a company
