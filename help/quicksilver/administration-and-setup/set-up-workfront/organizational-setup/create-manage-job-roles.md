   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Job roles are an integral part of managing resources. To use the resource planning tools, job roles need a cost and billing rate associated with them. For information, see [Get started with Resource Management](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/get-started-resource-management.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Job Role]**. The job role is now available to be assigned to tasks, issues, approvals, or you can share layout templates or other objects with it. For information about all uses of job roles in [!DNL Workfront], see [Job role overview](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/job-role-overview.md). For information about deleting a job role, see [Delete job roles](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/delete-job-roles.md).
