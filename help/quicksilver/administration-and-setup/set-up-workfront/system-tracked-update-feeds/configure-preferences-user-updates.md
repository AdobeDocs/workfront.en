# Configure preferences for user updates

You can configure preferences that give users access to certain features when they are adding comments in an object's Updates area.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>To perform these steps at the system level, you need the System Administrator access level.</p><p>To perform them for a group, you must be a manager of that group.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## Allow users to add images in updates

By default, users cannot add images in updates. When you enable this preference, users will be able to attach images in updates. The preference applies to all updates in all areas of your Workfront instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Images saved in updates count toward the document storage limit. For information, see [Check document storage limits](../../../documents/managing-documents/check-document-storage.md).
>* Images are only accessible through the Updates tab on an object and are not available on the Documents tab.
