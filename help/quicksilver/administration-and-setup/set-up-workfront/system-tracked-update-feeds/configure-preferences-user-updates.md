## Allow users to add images in updates

By default, users cannot add images in updates. When you enable this preference, users will be able to attach images in updates. The preference applies to all updates in all areas of your [!DNL Workfront] instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Images saved in updates count toward the document storage limit. For information, see [Check document storage limits](../../../documents/managing-documents/check-document-storage.md).
>* Images are accessible through the [!UICONTROL Updates] tab on an object and are also available in the [!UICONTROL Documents] area under the [!UICONTROL Main Menu].
>

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).
1. In the left panel, select **[!UICONTROL Interface]** > **[!UICONTROL Update Feeds]**.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Preferences]** tab.
