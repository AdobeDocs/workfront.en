# Configure locations

{{highlighted-preview-article-level}}

Rate cards allow your organization to easily manage billing rates for projects. For more information, see [Manage rate cards](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/manage-rate-cards.md). As an [!DNL Adobe] [!DNL Workfront] administrator, you can configure the default locations available to assign to job roles in rate cards. This ensures that the rate cards accurately reflect the market rates in each location.
