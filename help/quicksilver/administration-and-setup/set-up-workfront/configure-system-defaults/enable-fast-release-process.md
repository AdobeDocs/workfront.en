# Enable fast releases for your organization

Adobe Wworkfront has two models for releasing new features and updates. You can choose whether to receive new functionality on a quarterly basis, or on a faster release schedule. 

Both models offer the same features and updates. The only difference is in the timing. 

Example: 

* Company X has enabled the fast release process. They receive Feature A in August, Feature B in September, and Feature C in October. 
* Company Y has disabled the fast release process. They receive features A, B, and C with the quarterly release in October.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Customers who purchased Workfront after the 23.3 release (July 2023) have the fast release process enabled by default, and can opt out. 
>* Customers who purchased Workfront before the 23.3 release have the fast release process disabled by default, and can opt in.

## Enable or disable the fast release process for your organization

As a Workfront administrator, you can enable or disable the fast release process for your organization.

Consider the following when enabling or disabling the fast release process:

<!--What about if they enable it in the middle of the quarter. Will they just have access to whatever's been released that quarter?-->
* Disabling the fast release process does not take effect until the next quarterly release. 

1. Click the **Main Menu icon**, then click **Setup**.
1. Expand **System** in the left navigation, then click **Preferences**.
1. To enable fast releases, check the **Allow fast release process** checkbox.

   Or

   To disable fast releases and move to a quarterly release cycle, uncheck the **Allow fast release process** checkbox.

1. Confirm your choice in the popup window.
1. Click **Save**.
