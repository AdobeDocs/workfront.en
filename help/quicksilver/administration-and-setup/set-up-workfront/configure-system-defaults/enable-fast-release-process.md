# Enable or disable fast releases for your organization

Adobe Workfront has two models for releasing new features and updates. You can choose whether to receive new functionality on a quarterly basis, or on a faster release schedule. 

Both models offer the same features and updates. The only difference is in the timing. 

Example: 

* Company X has enabled the fast release process. They receive Feature A in August, Feature B in September, and Feature C in October. 
* Company Y has disabled the fast release process. They receive features A, B, and C with the quarterly release in October.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Customers who purchased Workfront after the 23.3 release (July 2023) have the fast release process enabled by default, and can opt out. 
>* Customers who purchased Workfront before the 23.3 release have the fast release process disabled by default, and can opt in.

## Considerations when enabling or disabling the fast release process

Consider the following when enabling or disabling the fast release process:

* **Enabling** the fast release process in the middle of a quarter gives your organization access to features and functionality that have already been released to the fast release. 
   
   For example, if feature A is released in August, and feature B is released in September, any organization that enables the fast release process in September will immediately have access to features A and B.

* **Disabling** the fast release process does not take effect until the next quarterly release. 
   
    For example, if a organization that has enabled fast release disables it in August, they will still receive the fast release features in September, because they will not move to the quarterly release until the next quarterly release occurs in October.

## Enable or disable the fast release process for your organization

{{step-1-to-setup}}
