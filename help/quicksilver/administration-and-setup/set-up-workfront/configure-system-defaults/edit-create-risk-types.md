## Risks types

Risk types are labels you can use for your risks to categorize them for reporting purposes. They are created in the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** area by the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator. After risk types are established in your **[!UICONTROL Setup]** area, they are universal to your system. All project owners can use the same risk types for their projects.

## Edit and create risk types

Some risk types are already in [!DNL Workfront], by default. To reflect the needs of your organization, you can either edit the existing risk types, or create new risk types.
