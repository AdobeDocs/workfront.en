## Risks types

Risk types are labels you can use for your risks to categorize them for reporting purposes. They are created in the **Setup** area by the Adobe Workfront administrator. After risk types are established in your **Setup** area, they are universal to your system. All project owners can use the same risk types for their projects.

## Edit and create risk types

Some risk types are already in Workfront, by default. To reflect the needs of your organization, you can either edit the existing risk types, or create new risk types.
