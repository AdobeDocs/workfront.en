# Configure system-wide project preferences

As an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator, you can configure the default preferences for all projects created throughout the system. These preferences impact project, task, and issue behavior.

>[!NOTE]
>
>By default, these preferences are locked and group administrators cannot modify them at the group level unless you unlock them for all groups throughout the system. For more information, see [Lock or unlock project preferences for all groups in the system](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/lock-or-unlock-project-preferences-for-groups-system.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan</td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license</td> 
   <td>[!UICONTROL Plan]</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a [!DNL Workfront] administrator.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>

## Configure project preferences for the entire organization

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the left panel, click **[!UICONTROL Project Preferences]** > **[!UICONTROL Projects]**.

1. On the page that appears, continue with one of the 4 sections listed below to configure preferences for [!UICONTROL Project Status], [!UICONTROL Timelines], [!UICONTROL Business Cases], and [!UICONTROL Life after Death].
1. If you want all groups throughout the organization to use the same project preferences, make sure each preference is locked ![](assets/lock-toggle-button.png) (this is the default).

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >When a project preference is locked, any changes you make to that preference are inherited by all groups in the system. It's important to communicate with the users and groups throughout your organization to ensure that all needs are accounted for in the way you configure project preferences.

   For information about unlocking a preference so that all groups can configure and manage it on their own, see [Lock or unlock project preferences for all groups in the system](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/lock-or-unlock-project-preferences-for-groups-system.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

     <li> <p><strong>[!UICONTROL Consider user time off in task durations]</strong>: Any time off scheduled for a task's Primary Assignee adjusts the task's planned dates if the time off occurs during the task's duration. This is the default setting. </p> <p>For example, if a task with a Constraint of [!UICONTROL As Soon As Possible] is scheduled to start on June 1 and complete on June 3, and the Primary Assignee has June 2 marked for Time-off, the task's planned dates adjust to June 1 through June 4.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: The Duration of the task does not change when you select this setting.

     <li><strong>[!UICONTROL Ignore user time off in task durations]</strong>: The planned dates of each task on a project remain as originally planned, even if the Primary Assignee of a task has time off during its duration.</li> 
    </ul> <p>Consider the following when selecting options for this setting:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>When you change this setting, only the projects and templates created after the change inherit the updated setting. </li> 
     <li> <p>The Task Constraint value of the task determines which planned task dates to adjust: </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>The Planned Start Date</li>

       <li>Both dates</li>

### [!UICONTROL Business Cases] {#business-cases}

You can create a Business Case for newly created projects throughout the system to submit project requests. You can define preferences to determine which areas are visible on the **[!UICONTROL Business Case]** form. We recommend that you enable these options so that other tools, such as the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer], update properly. For more information about what each field displays, see [Define a Business Case](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/define-business-case.md).

After the [!DNL Workfront] administrator enables the sections on the [!UICONTROL Business Case], a Project Owner can then create a Business Case at the project level. For information about creating a Business Case, see [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).
