# Assign a schedule to a user or project

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: This article is drafted and should probably be deleted. Caroline and I spoke about this: this is not an admin function, so it should not be in this section. I have linked the individual articles that speak about how to assign schedules to users and projects in the steps of the article /Content/Administration and Setup/Set up Workfront/Configure Timesheets Schedules/create-schedules.html) </p>
