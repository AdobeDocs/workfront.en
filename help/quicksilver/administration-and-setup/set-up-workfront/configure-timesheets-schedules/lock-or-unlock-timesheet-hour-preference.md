# Overview of locking system-level timesheet and hour preferences

Locking an Adobe Workfront preference```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  that you have configured at the system level</MadCap:conditionalText>``` ensures that everyone```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  throughout the system</MadCap:conditionalText>``` is using the same setting for that preference. Though you can still reconfigure a preference that you lock, group administrators can't do so for ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level"> their groups</MadCap:conditionalText>```.

Conversely, unlocking a preference```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  that you have configured at the system level</MadCap:conditionalText>``` allows group administrators more flexibility to manage the way their groups work with those items. When a preference is unlocked, group administrators can reconfigure it for ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level"> their groups</MadCap:conditionalText>```.

For instructions on locking or unlocking a system-level project, task, or issue preference, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).
