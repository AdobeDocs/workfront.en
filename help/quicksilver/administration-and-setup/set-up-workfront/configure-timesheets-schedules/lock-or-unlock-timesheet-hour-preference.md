# Overview of locking system-level timesheet and hour preferences

Locking an Adobe Workfront preferencethat you have configured at the system level ensures that everyonethroughout the system is using the same setting for that preference. Though you can still reconfigure a preference that you lock, group administrators can’t do so for their groups.

Conversely, unlocking a preferencethat you have configured at the system level allows group administrators more flexibility to manage the way their groups work with those items. When a preference is unlocked, group administrators can reconfigure it for their groups.

For instructions on locking or unlocking a system-level project, task, or issue preference, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).
