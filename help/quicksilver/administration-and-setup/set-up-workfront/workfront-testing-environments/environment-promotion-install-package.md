# Install an environment promotion package

## Mapping

<!--How does one get to the mapping page?-->

<!--Also show how to tell you're installing it in the right place (note 3 on slide 3)-->

Each object in the package is shown in the left navigation, and as a card on the page.

Each card displays the object and its <!--fields? properties? sub-objects>-->. You can determine how these <!--???-->s will move to the new environment. 

* Create new <!--does this mean you can have multiples?-->
* Use existing
* Overwrite existing
* Do not use
