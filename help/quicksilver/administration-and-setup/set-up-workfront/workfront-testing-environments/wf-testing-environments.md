title: Adobe Workfront testing environments
description: You can use two [!DNL Workfront] testing environments that replicate your [!DNL Workfront] production environment. The Preview Sandbox is refreshed each weekend by Workfront. Data added to your live environment on Friday appears in your Preview Sandbox by the following Monday. The Custom Refresh Sandbox is a separate testing environment which is refreshed manually by you. There is an additional cost to obtain the Custom Refresh Sandbox.
