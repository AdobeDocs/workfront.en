1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** or move on to the [Set up metadata (Optional)](#set-up-metadata-optional) section in this article.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Due to the complexity of the integration, you can't change the repository after you save the initial configuration.

## Set up metadata (Optional)

You can map [!DNL Workfront] object data to asset media fields in [!DNL Experience Manager] Assets.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You can map metadata only in one direction: from [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Experience Manager]. Metadata for documents linked to [!DNL Workfront] from [!DNL Experience Manager] cannot be transferred to [!DNL Workfront].

### Configure metadata fields

Before you begin mapping metadata fields, you must configure metadata fields in both Workfront and Experience Manager Assets.

To configure metadata fields:

1. Configure a metadata schema in [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as explained in [Configure asset metadata mapping between Adobe [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Experience Manager Assets]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/integrations/configure-asset-metadata-mapping.html?lang=en).


1. Configure custom form fields in Workfront. [!DNL Workfront] has many built-in custom fields you can use. However, you can also create your own custom fields as explained in [Create or edit a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

+++ **Expand to see more information about supported Workfront and Experience Manager Assets fields** 

**Experience Manager Assets Tags**

You can map any Workfront supported field to a tag in Experience Manager Assets. To do this, you must ensure that tag values in Experience Manager Assets match Workfront. 

* Tags and Workfront field values must be an exact match in spelling, and format. 
* Workfront field values that are mapped to experience Manager assets tags must be all lowercase, even if the tag in Experience Manager Assets appears to have uppercase letters.
* Workfront field values must not include spaces.
* The field value in Workfront must also include the folder structure of the Experience Manager Assets tag.
* To map multiple single-line text fields to tags, enter a comma-separated list of the tag values into the Workfront side of the metadata mapping, and `xcm:keywords` on the Experience Manager Assets side. Each field value maps to a separate tag. You can use a calculated field to combine multiple Workfront fields into a single comma-separated text field.
* You can map values from drop-down, radio button, or checkbox fields by entering a comma-separated list of the available values in that field.


>[!INFO]
>
>**Example**:  To match the tag shown in the folder structure here, the field value in Workfront would be `landscapes:trees/spruce`. Note the lowercase letters in the Workfront field value.
>
>If you want the tag to be leftmost item in the tag tree, it must be followed by a colon. In this example, to map to the landscapes tag, the field value in Workfront would be `landscapes:`.
>
>![Folder structure in AEM](assets/aem-folder-structure-with-red-boxes.png)


After you have created the tags in Experience Manager Assets, they will appear under the Tags drop-down in the Metadata section. To link a field to a tag, select `xcm:keywords` in the Experience Manager Assets field dropdown in the metadata mapping area.

For more information on tags in Experience Manager Assets, including how to create and manage tags, see [Administering Tags]( https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-64/administering/contentmanagement/tags.html?lang=en).

**Experience Manager Assets custom metadata schema fields**

You can map both built-in and custom Workfront fields to custom metadata schema fields in Experience Manager Assets. 

Custom metadata fields created in Experience Manager Assets are organized in their own section in the Metadata setup area.

**Workfront fields**

You can map both built-in and custom Workfront fields to Experience Manager Assets. The following field values must match in both case and spelling between Workfront and Experience Manager Assets:

* Drop-down fields
* Multi-select fields

>[!TIP]
>
> To check if the field values match exactly, go to 
>
> * Setup > Custom Forms in Workfront or the field in the object
> * Assets > metadata schemas in Experience Manager Assets

1. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Sync object metadata]** field.
1. Click Save or move on to the [Set up linked folders (Optional)](#set-up-linked-folders-optional) section in this article.

## Set up linked folders (Optional)

You can allow users to create folders linked to [!DNL Experience Manager] while in a [!DNL Workfront] project. When a folder is linked, any asset added to the folder automatically shows up in both [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Experience Manager]. When an asset is added to the linked folder in [!DNL Workfront] for the first time, the asset's metadata is pushed to [!DNL Experience Manager Assets].

In the steps below, you indicate where you want the linked folders created. Each integration can have only one location for all linked folders.

To set up linked folders:

1. Toggle the **[!UICONTROL Enable Linked folder]** on.
1. Choose a folder path to indicate where you want all linked folders associated with this integration. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Users need write access in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] to the folder specified to create a linked folder.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
