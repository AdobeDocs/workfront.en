<h2>Enable the Slack integration</h2>
<p>The first time you add a Slack card to a FLO, you must set up a connection for that connector. </p>
<p>To set up a connection with Slack:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li value="1">Click <strong>+New FLO</strong> in the top right corner of the screen.</li>
<li value="2">Search for Slack and click the Slack app.</li>
<li value="3">Choose the event or action you want in your FLO.</li>
<li value="4">Do either of the following, depending on whether a connection is already configured:
<ul>
<li>If a connection is already configured, click <strong>New connection</strong> in the top right corner of the card to create a new connection.</li>
<li>If you don't have any connections configured, click <strong>New Connection</strong> be taken to the next step.</li>
</ul></li>
<li value="5">Name your connection. Choose something unique, because you might need to distinguish between multiple connections in the future.</li>
<li value="6">Click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
<li value="7">(Conditional) Sign in to Slack if you are not currently signed in. </li>
<li value="8">In the dialog box, select the Slack account you want to connect to. </li>
<li value="9">Click <strong>Authorize</strong> to give Legacy Workfront Fusion access to your Slack data. This allows Legacy Workfront Fusion to send messages on your behalf. You can reuse this connection any time you use Slack in a FLO. </li>
</ol>
<p>After you have set up a connection, you can use that connection again or set up a new one.</p>
<h2>What you can do with the Slack integration</h2>
<p>There are multiple Events in Slack that can trigger FLOs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Message in Channel:</strong> Start FLO when there is a new message in a certain channel</li>
<li><strong>New Message in Private Channel:</strong> Start FLO when there is a new message in your private Slack channel.</li>
<li><strong>New Pinned Message:</strong> Start FLO when a message is pinned in a certain channel</li>
<li><strong>Slash Command:</strong> Start FLO when someone sends a slash command to a custom bot. Use with "Respond to Command" action.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a FLO is triggered, you can configure it to perform the following Actions in Slack: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Archive Channel:</strong> Archive a channel with name or channel ID</li>
<li><strong>Create Channel:</strong> Create a public or private slack channel</li>
