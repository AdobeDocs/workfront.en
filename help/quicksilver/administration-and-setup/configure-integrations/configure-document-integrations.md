As an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator, you can configure document integrations to manage documents in [!UICONTROL Workfront]. You can also configure [!UICONTROL Workfront] so that documents are stored only in document services applications and not in [!UICONTROL Workfront] itself. For more information, see [Update and link a document from [!UICONTROL Workfront] to an external cloud provider](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md#sending-documents) in [Link documents from external applications](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

>[!NOTE]

You can configure the following integrations for managing documents:

   <!--
  Experience Manager Assets Essentials </p>
  -->

* [!DNL Workfront DAM]

* [!DNL Workfront Proof]

   Linking proofs from [!DNL Workfront Proof] allows you to make proofs that were originally created within [!DNL Workfront Proof] available within [!DNL Workfront]. A [!UICONTROL Pro] [!DNL Workfront] Plan or higher is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [Workfront Plans.](https://www.workfront.com/plans)

* [!DNL Microsoft SharePoint]

   For information about integrating with [!DNL SharePoint], see [Configure the [!DNL SharePoint] integration](../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-sharepoint-integration.md).

    * [!DNL Box]
    * [!DNL Dropbox]
    * [!DNL Dropbox Business]
    * [!DNL WebDAM]
    * [!DNL Microsoft OneDrive]
    * [!UICONTROL Google Drive]

      <!--Quip-->
   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can proof and approve documents linked from an external cloud provider the same way you proof and approve documents uploaded directly to [!DNL Workfront].

* Other document providers (through custom document integrations).

   A [!UICONTROL Pro] [!DNL Workfront] Plan or higher is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [[!DNL Workfront] Plans.](https://www.workfront.com/plans)

In addition, you can enhance your [!DNL Workfront] document experience with a native Digital Asset Management (DAM) system, or with third-party DAM integrations. Administrators must enable these features in order for users to link the service to their [!DNL Workfront] account. For more information about Workfront DAM, see [Managing Documents with [!DNL Adobe Workfront DAM]](../../documents/workfront-dam-within-workfront/manage-docs-with-wf-dam.md).

1. Select the integrations you want enabled.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

If you are setting up integrations with [!DNL Workfront DAM], you can enable [!DNL Workfront] to include metadata with documents. For information about mapping metadata, see [Set up metadata mapping](../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/set-up-metadata-mapping.md).

## Configure custom document integrations

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: ***DON'T DELETE, DRAFT OR HIDE THIS SECTION IT IS LINKED TO THE PRODUCT, THROUGH THE CONTEXT SENSITIVE HELP LINKS. **)</p>
-->

A custom document integration allows [!DNL Workfront] users to link files into [!DNL Workfront] from practically any system, provided that the system is made to work with [!DNL Workfront].

To make the custom integration available to users, you first need to build the integration. For information about how to build integrations to be used with [!DNL Workfront], see [Document Webhooks API](../../wf-api/doc-wbhks-api/docu-webhook-api.md).

After the custom document integration is built, you can make it available to users on your site.

1. Log in to [!DNL Workfront] as the administrator.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the left panel, click **[!UICONTROL Documents]** > **[!UICONTROL Custom Integration].**

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Custom integration]**.
1. Specify the following information to configure the integration:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Name]</td> 
      <td>The name of the custom integration. This is the name users see when using the integration within Workfront.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Base API URL] </td> 
      <td>The base HTTP or secure HTTP URL for API calls. For example, <a class="link-https" title="https://documentprovider.com/api/v2" href="https://documentprovider.com/api/v2">https://documentprovider.com/api/v2</a></td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Authentication Type]</td> 
      <td> <p>The authentication method to use when making authorized API calls to the custom integration.</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>If you choose <strong>[!UICONTROL OAuth]</strong>, continue with Step 6.</li> 
        <li>If you choose <strong>[!UICONTROL ApiKey]</strong>, continue with Step 7.</li> 
       </ul> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. (Conditional) If you selected **[!UICONTROL OAuth]** authentication for the **[!UICONTROL Authentication Type]**, specify the following information:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Authentication URL]</td> 
      <td>The full URL used for user authentication. [!DNL Workfront] navigates users to this address as part of the OAuth provisioning process.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Token Endpoint URL]</td> 
      <td>The full API URL used to retrieve OAuth tokens.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Client ID]</td> 
      <td>The OAut Client ID for this integration.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Client Secret]</td> 
      <td>The OAut Client Secret for this integration.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Request Parameters]</td> 
      <td> <p>Specify optional values to be appended to the query string of every API call. For example, access_type=offline.</p> <p>To add multiple request parameters, click <strong>+Add Request Parameter</strong>.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The [!DNL Workfront] Redirect URI that displays at the bottom of the [!UICONTROL Custom Integration] page lists the URI used to register this integration with the external document provider.

1. (Conditional) If you selected **[!UICONTROL ApiKey]** authentication for the **[!UICONTROL Authentication Type]**, specify the API key that was issued by the custom document provider.

   [!DNL Workfront] uses this API key to make authorized API calls to the document provider.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to create the integration.

## Use document integrations

For information about how users can use [!DNL Workfront DAM], see [Managing Documents with [!DNL Adobe Workfront DAM]](../../documents/workfront-dam-within-workfront/manage-docs-with-wf-dam.md).

For information about how users can use proofing, see [Create proofs](../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-proofs--in-wf.md).

For information about how users can use third-party document integrations after you have configured them, see [Link documents from external applications](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

### Configure [!DNL Workfront] to send metadata to [!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront] DAM] {#configure-workfront-to-send-metadata-to-workfront-dam}

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: ***DON'T DELETE, DRAFT OR HIDE THIS SECTION IT IS LINKED TO THE PRODUCT, THROUGH THE CONTEXT SENSITIVE HELP LINKS. **) </p>
-->

When sending a document from [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Workfront DAM], you can also send information associated with that document. Information about the document is mapped to [!DNL Workfront DAM] as metadata.

Information is mapped one-way only, from [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Workfront DAM] and it is transferred only when the document is uploaded to [!DNL Workfront DAM]. Any future changes in the Workfront fields will not update metadata fields in [!DNL Workfront DAM] after the document has already been uploaded.\
You can map the same [!DNL Workfront] field to various [!DNL Workfront DAM] fields, but you cannot use the same [!DNL Workfront DAM] field for multiple [!DNL Workfront] fields.

If you must configure multiple [!DNL Workfront] fields to export to one [!DNL Workfront DAM] field, first create a calculated custom field in [!DNL Workfront] to display all the individual custom fields of an object. Then, map the calculated [!DNL Workfront] field to one [!DNL Workfront DAM] field.\
For more information about calculated custom fields, see [Add calculated data to a custom form](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-calculated-data-to-custom-form.md).

The mapping affects all the documents uploaded by any user from [!DNL Workfront] to [!UICONTROL Workfront] DAM.

As a [!DNL Workfront] administrator, you must enable [!DNL Workfront DAM] in Workfront before you can map the fields for the metadata mapping process. For more information about how to enable [!DNL Workfront DAM], see [Configure Workfront to send metadata to [!DNL Workfront DAM]](#configure-workfront-to-send-metadata-to-workfront-dam).

To configure [!DNL Workfront] to send metadata to [!DNL Workfront DAM]:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Documents]** > **[!UICONTROL Metadata Mapping]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select Source Field for Mapping]** field, begin typing the name of the Workfront field you want to map to [!DNL Workfront DAM], then select it when you see it in the list.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select Target Field for Mapping]**, select the [!DNL Workfront DAM] field you want to populate with the information in the selected [!DNL Workfront] field.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > All documents sent to [!DNL Workfront DAM] by users who have the rights to do so have their metadata updated with the [!DNL Workfront] fields mapped here, when they upload to [!DNL Workfront DAM].

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Mapping]**.

1. Continue adding more [!UICONTROL Workfront] fields and corresponding [!DNL Workfront DAM] fields.

### Delete mapped fields

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Adobe Workfront], then click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. Expand **[!UICONTROL Documents]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Metadata Mapping]**.

1. In the list of fields, select any of the fields you want to remove from metadata mapping.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

   The fields are removed from metadata mapping and the information contained in them is not transferred to [!DNL Workfront DAM] with the uploaded documents.
