# [!DNL Adobe Workfront] integrations

<!--Audited: 12/2023-->

You can integrate [!DNL Adobe Workfront] with third-party applications, as well as other [!DNL Adobe] products. Integrations can extend the utility of Workfront and tailor it to the needs of your organization.

The integrations for [!DNL Workfront] fall into the following categories:

## Built-in (native) integrations

[!DNL Workfront] provides various integrations you can configure either directly from the Workfront application, or directly from another application by installing the [!DNL Workfront] add-in for that application.

Some of these integrations are available at no additional cost, while other integrations require an additional purchase:

* [Get started with built-in (native) integrations](#get-started-with-built-in-native-integrations) 
* [Integrations available at no additional cost](#integrations-available-at-no-additional-cost) 
* [Integrations requiring an additional purchase](#integrations-requiring-an-additional-purchase)

### Get started with built-in (native) integrations {#get-started-with-built-in-native-integrations}

To get started with built-in (native) integrations, follow the following workflow:

1. **Determine which native integration(s) best fits your needs**

   When choosing an integration, it is important to pick an application that people already use regularly. Integrating [!DNL Workfront] with a regularly, or frequently, used application will increase adoption among your users.

   For a list of available integrations, see [Integrations available at no additional cost](#integrations-available-at-no-additional-cost) and [Integrations requiring an additional purchase](#integrations-requiring-an-additional-purchase).

1. **Identify your technology administrator**

   Identify your organization's technology administrator for the application you want to integrate with [!DNL Workfront]. For example, if you choose to integrate with [!DNL Jira], you must connect with your company's [!DNL Jira] administrator and involve them in any configuration needs within their platform. You should also involve this administrator in any conversation with [!DNL Workfront] Customer Support.

   To get your administrator started, you'll need to provide them with the specific instructions for that integration. For links to these instructions, see [Integrations available at no additional cost](#integrations-available-at-no-additional-cost).

1. **Engage with [!DNL Workfront] Customer Support**

   If your administrator has any issues with the native integration setup, you can engage with [!DNL Workfront] Customer Support to help guide or troubleshoot. While [!DNL Workfront] will not set up the integration for you, we are committed to giving you all the necessary tools and resources you need to do it yourself. You can speak directly to Customer Support, or you can explore the extensive resource articles to help you easily set up your integration.

   To connect with customer support, see [Contact Customer Support](../../workfront-basics/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/contact-customer-support.md).

   For links to help articles, see [Integrations available at no additional cost](#integrations-available-at-no-additional-cost). and [Integrations requiring an additional purchase](#integrations-requiring-an-additional-purchase).

   For instructions on creating a support case, see [Contact Customer Support](../../workfront-basics/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/contact-customer-support.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You must be the Assigned Support Contact at your organization to submit a support case. After the case is submitted, you can add your technology administrator for the other system to the conversation. They cannot contact support directly.

We understand that the available built-in (native) integrations might not meet all of your company needs. If this is the case, contact your Account Executive to discuss a custom integration.

### Integrations available at no additional cost {#integrations-available-at-no-additional-cost}
