The Legacy Workfront Fusion integration platform enables you to connect Workfront to multiple third-party applications. For example, you can create a new project in Workfront once your marketing budget is approved in another application. For information about the 2020 version of this product, Workfront Fusion, see the Workfront Fusion product page. About Legacy Workfront Fusion Designer is the core tool for building connections in Legacy Workfront Fusion, and contains a few basic elements. Every connector you build within Designer contains the following elements: FLO: Integrations in Legacy Workfront Fusion are built using FLOs. A FLO is a process with a series of steps that is kicked off by a singular event (for example, a record is added or updated or a period of time has elapsed). Card: A unit of functionality, either an Action or Event. Each step in a FLO is called a card. An Event card triggers a series of Actions that manipulate data or connect Legacy Workfront Fusion to your desired application. Input Field: A field that accepts a value of a certain type that is user-defined. Output Field: A field that contains a value that is defined at the runtime of the FLO. Each card accepts data as an input and returns new data as an output. Legacy Workfront Fusion offers a library of prebuilt cloud applications that allow you to activate a FLO when events occur inside a selected cloud application. Legacy Workfront Fusion has over 150 available connectors. Each Legacy Workfront Fusion package contains a certain number of tables per connector and days of Execution History. Table: Used to store data across different FLOs with no external services or additional credentials required. Tables allow for efficient integration lookups or other processing needs. Execution History (FLO History): The record of every aspect of data in every FLO. It is commonly used for troubleshooting issues with individual FLOs. Note: When you create a FLO that contains a Workfront custom field, you need to make sure that the option Display field change in update feeds is selected in the field's settings. For more information, see the section Create or edit a custom form in the article Create or edit a custom form. Connect applications with Legacy Workfront Fusion For detailed information about each connector and how to configure it, see the Legacy Workfront Fusion Help Center. Note: If a connection fails when you create it, delete it and create a new one instead of trying to reauthorize it.
