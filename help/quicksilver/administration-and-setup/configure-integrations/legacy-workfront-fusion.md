<p>The Legacy Workfront Fusion integration platform enables you to connect Workfront to multiple third-party applications. For example, you can create a new project in Workfront once your marketing budget is approved in another application.</p>
<p>For information about the 2020 version of this product, Workfront Fusion, see the <a href="https://www.workfront.com/products/fusion/">Workfront Fusion product page</a>.</p>
<h2>About Legacy Workfront Fusion</h2>
<p>Designer is the core tool for building connections in Legacy Workfront Fusion, and contains a few basic elements. Every connector you build within Designer contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p><strong>FLO:</strong> Integrations in Legacy Workfront Fusion are built using FLOs. A FLO is a process with a series of steps that is kicked off by a singular event (for example, a record is added or updated or a period of time has elapsed).</p> </li>
<li><strong>Card:</strong> A unit of functionality, either an Action or Event. Each step in a FLO is called a card. An Event card triggers a series of Actions that manipulate data or connect Legacy Workfront Fusion to your desired application.</li>
<li><strong>Input Field:</strong> A field that accepts a value of a certain type that is user-defined.</li>
<li><strong>Output Field:</strong> A field that contains a value that is defined at the runtime of the FLO. Each card accepts data as an input and returns new data as an output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legacy Workfront Fusion offers a library of prebuilt cloud applications that allow you to activate a FLO when events occur inside a selected cloud application. Legacy Workfront Fusion has over 150 available connectors.</p>
<p>Each Legacy Workfront Fusion package contains a certain number of tables per connector and days of Execution History.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Table:</strong> Used to store data across different FLOs with no external services or additional credentials required. Tables allow for efficient integration lookups or other processing needs.</li>
<li><strong>Execution History (FLO History):</strong> The record of every aspect of data in every FLO. It is commonly used for troubleshooting issues with individual FLOs.</li>
</ul> <note type="note">
When you create a FLO that contains a Workfront custom field, you need to make sure that the option
<strong>Display field change in update feeds</strong> is selected in the field's settings. For more information, see the section

<h2>Connect applications with Legacy Workfront Fusion</h2>
<p>For detailed information about each connector and how to configure it, see the <a href="https://learn.fusion.workfront.com/connector-reference/">Legacy Workfront Fusion Help Center</a>.</p> <note type="note">
If a connection fails when you create it, delete it and create a new one instead of trying to reauthorize it.
