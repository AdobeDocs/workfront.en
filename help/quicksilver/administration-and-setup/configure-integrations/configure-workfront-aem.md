## [!DNL Workfront for AEM Assets]

The [!DNL Workfront for AEM Assets connector] allows your organization to do the following:

* Collaborate and manage creative content by linking AEM assets and folders to projects, tasks, issues, and requests in [!DNL Workfront].

   For more information about configuring documentation integrations with third-party applications, see  [Configure document integrations](../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-document-integrations.md).

* Integrate with the [!DNL AEM Digital Asset Managemen]t (DAM) repository, allowing you to use [!DNL Workfront] to manage and share digital assets stored in the DAM.

   For more information about linking documents and asset folders, see   [Link documents from external applications](../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

* Combine and apply metadata from both applications to an asset.
* View an all-inclusive communication stream for an asset. Updates and comments made to an asset either in [!DNL Workfront] or [!UICONTROL AEM Assets] are synchronized to the other application, establishing a comprehensive history of communications made to the asset.

   For more information about making comments in [!DNL Workfront], see [Add an update to a document](../../documents/managing-documents/add-update-documents.md).
