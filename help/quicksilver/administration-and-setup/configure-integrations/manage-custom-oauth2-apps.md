# View and manage custom OAuth2 applications

As an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator, you can view and manage the OAuth2 applications for your instance of [!DNL Workfront], which allow other applications to access [!UICONTROL Workfront].

>[!NOTE]
>
>* In the context of OAuth2, "Oauth2 application" refers to this sort of access link between an app and a server such as [!DNL Workfront]. For more information, see [Create OAuth2 applications for [!DNL Workfront] integrations](../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/create-oauth-application.md)
>* You can have up to a total of ten OAuth2 Applications at one time.

* For information on creating custom OAuth2 applications, see [Create OAuth2 applications for [!DNL Workfront] integrations](../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/create-oauth-application.md)
* For instructions on configuring and using the OAuth2 application with user credentials (authorization code flow), see [Configure and use your organization's custom OAuth 2 applications using authorization code flow](../../wf-api/api/oauth-app-code-token-flow.md).
* For instructions on configuring and using the OAuth2 application using server authentication (JWT flow), see [Configure and use your organization's custom OAuth 2 applications using JWT flow](../../wf-api/api/oauth-app-jwt-flow.md).
* For instructions on configuring and using the OAuth2 application using PKCE, see [Configure and use your organization's custom OAuth 2 applications using PKCE flow](../../wf-api/api/oauth-app-pkce-flow.md).
