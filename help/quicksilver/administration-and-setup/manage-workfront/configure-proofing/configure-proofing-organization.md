     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
      <td>The name users see when selecting the device in the Desktop Proofing Viewer, as described in&nbsp;<a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/view-interactive-content-as-it-appears-in-device.md" class="MCXref xref">Change interactive proof resolution in the proofing viewer</a>.</td>

## Configure pop-up messages for proofs

You can configure pop-up messages on proofs to communicate general information to all reviewers in your organization.

You can configure messages to appear in the following situations:

* **On load message**: Displays when the proof first opens. Useful for explaining to users how to review a proof or to provide a disclaimer or other legal text.
* **On decision message**: Displays when a user selects a decision on a proof. Useful for giving your users checklists for things such as brand or regulatory compliance. For information about decisions, see [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md).

* **Confirm button text**: The label that displays on the button in the On load pop-up message explained above.

To create pop-up messages for proofs:

1. Click **Edit** to the right of the message you want to customize.
1. Specify a message and include the appropriate formatting, then click **Save**.
1. (Optional) If you customized the On load message and you want to also customize the confirmation button label, click&nbsp;**Edit** to the right of&nbsp;**Confirm button text**, specify a label, then click&nbsp;**Save**.&nbsp;

## Configure proof defaults

For information about configuring proof defaults for your organization, see [Configure default proof settings](administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-default-proof-settings.md).


## Configure sharing defaults

You can specify who your organization's proofs can be shared with, what versions are available for reviewers, and&nbsp;when proofs with an Automated Workflow are visible to users who are associated with a given stage.

For more detailed information about sharing settings within Workfront Proof, see [Configure sharing settings for your users](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-sharing-settings-users.md).&nbsp;

## Brand the Workfront Proof site

If you are using Workfront Proof, you can set up branding for the following areas of the site:

* The splash page that displays when the proof loads
* Log in and Log out screens
* Email notifications

For detailed information about how to brand the Workfront Proof site, see&nbsp; [Brand the Workfront Proof site](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/branding/brand-wp-site.md).

## Configure advanced password settings

>[!IMPORTANT]
