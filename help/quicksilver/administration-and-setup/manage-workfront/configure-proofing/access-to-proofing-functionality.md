# Access to proofing functionality in Workfront

The proofing functionality available to your users depends on which Workfront plan your organization purchased.

## Proofing in Workfront

There are currently three plan options for Proofing in Workfront:

* **New Workfront plans**: Proofing is automatically included for all licenses in the new Workfront plans.
* **Current Workfront Pro+ Plans**: Proofing is automatically included for Work and Plan licenses if you have the pro, business or enterprise Workfront plans. 
* **Workfront Premium Legacy plans**: This option is for legacy Workfront Plans—Select, Enterprise, Premium. Proofing is not automatically included with licenses in this plan. You must grant proofing access to specific users in their user profile.

  If you are a Workfront administrator, you can check and see which plan your instance is on by going to Setup > System > Licenses.

### Proofing capabilities in Workfront

For information about granting and revoking a user's access to create and view proofs in Workfront, see [Configure a user's proofing access](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-a-users-proofing-access.md).

* Generate static or interactive proofs on external-facing URLs and documents. For more information, see [Create proofs](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/create-proofs--in-wf.md).
* Include Automated Workflows on proofs. For more information, see [Automated Workflow overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/automated-workflow.md).
* Set access and subscriptions settings on proofs. For more information, see [Configure access and subscription settings for a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/configure-access-subscription-settings-proof.md).
* Assign custom proof permission profiles when enabling proofing capabilities for a user in Workfront. For more information, see [Enable and disable proofing for a user (legacy plans only)](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-a-users-proofing-access.md#enabling-and-disabling-proofing-for-a-user) in [Configure a user's proofing access](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-a-users-proofing-access.md).
* Track proof progress and status. For more information, see [Proof progress and status overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/view-progress-status-proof.md).
* Set the Workfront Proof permission profile when creating proofing users within Workfront, as described in this section.

  These profiles affect permissions only in Workfront Proof permissions, not in Workfront.

* Compare two proofs or two versions of the same proof. For more information, see [Compare proofs](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/compare-proofs.md).
* Create a Proof Approval report. For more information, see  [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).
* View the proof stage that is currently active on each document version in the Document Version report. The name of the stage is displayed in the "Active Proof Stages" column. If no stage is currently active on the document version, the column is blank. For more information about available fields in views and reports, see [Glossary of Adobe Workfront terminology](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/workfront-terminology-glossary.md).
* Configure when proofs with an automated workflow are visible to users who are associated with a given stage. For more information, see [Configure proof visibility based on workflow stage activity](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-sharing-settings-users.md#configuring-proof-visibility-based-on-workflow-stage-activity) in  [Configure sharing settings for your users](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-sharing-settings-users.md).
* Seamless access to Workfront Proof directly from the Workfront Global Navigation Bar (no extra login required). For more information, see [Access Workfront Proof from Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/access-wf-proof-in-workfront.md).
