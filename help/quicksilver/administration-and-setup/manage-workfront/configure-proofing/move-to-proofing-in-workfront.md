# Standalone Workfront Proof to Integrated Proofing in Workfront overview

If your organization changes from the standalone version of Workfront Proof to the Workfront Pro plan, in which Workfront Proof Premium is integrated with Workfront, the following functionality is not available:

* Ability to access Workfront Proof (limited to Workfront administrators). For more information, see [Access Workfront Proof from Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/access-wf-proof-in-workfront.md).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >In Workfront Proof, the New proof button is disabled; proofs can be created only Workfront.

* Ability to copy a version of a proof. For more information, see&nbsp; [Copying Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/copy-proofs.md).  

* Ability to copy the settings of an existing proof. For more information, see [Copying Existing Proof Settings for a New Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/copy-proofs.md#copy-with-new-file)&nbsp;in [Copying Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/copy-proofs.md).  

* Ability to change the previous version of a proof. For more information, see [Linking Proof Versions](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-versions.md#linking-and-unlinking-proof-versions) in [Managing Proof Versions in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-versions.md).  

* Ability to remove link to previous version of a proof. For more information, see [Unlinking Proof Versions](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-versions.md#unlinkingproofversions) in [Managing Proof Versions in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-versions.md).  

* Ability to add tags to proofs. For more information, see [Create and Manage Tags in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/organize-your-work/create-and-manage-tags.md).  

* Ability of administrator to assign custom proof permission profiles. For more information, see&nbsp; [Configure custom profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-custom-profiles.md).  

* Ability of administrator to enable and disable proofing functionality for a single user.

  For more information, see [Enable and disable proofing for a user (legacy plans only)](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-a-users-proofing-access.md#enabling-and-disabling-proofing-for-a-user) in the article [Configure a user's proofing access](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-a-users-proofing-access.md).

* This ability is no longer necessary because proofing functionality is now available for all users with a worker license or higher. Reviewers and guests can access and work on proofs, but cannot generate proofs.
* Ability of users to access the standalone version of Workfront Proof (this is limited to Workfront administrators).
* Ability to connect between the new integrated account and the Workfront Proof account.&nbsp;
* Ability to run Workfront Proof reports:
