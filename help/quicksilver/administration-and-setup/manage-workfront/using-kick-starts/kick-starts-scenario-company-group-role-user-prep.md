# Kick-Starts Scenario: Company, Group, Role, and User Kick-Starts Preparation

When you begin implementing Adobe Workfront, rather than manually inputting data, you can import your customer list, internal departments, job roles, and user information.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td>Plan</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a Workfront administrator.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
