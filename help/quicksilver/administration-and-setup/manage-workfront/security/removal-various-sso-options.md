# Removal of various single sign-on options

Adobe Workfront is removing support for various single sign-on (SSO) options. The end result will be a consistent and more secure sign-in experience across all Workfront products and services.

The following SSO options are now supported only in a limited capacity; they will be removed from the product in 2020:

* LDAP

* Active Directory

* SAML 1.1
