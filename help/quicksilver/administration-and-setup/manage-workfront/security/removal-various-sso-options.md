# Removal of various single sign-on options

Adobe Workfront has removed support for various single sign-on (SSO) options. The end result is a consistent and more secure sign-in experience across all Workfront products and services.

The following SSO options were removed from the product in 2020:

* LDAP
* Active Directory
* SAML 1.1

For information about available SSO solutions, see [Overview of single sign-on in Adobe Workfront](../../add-users/single-sign-on/sso-in-workfront.md).
