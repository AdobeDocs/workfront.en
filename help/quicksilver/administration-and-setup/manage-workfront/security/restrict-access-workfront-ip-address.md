# Restrict access to Adobe Workfront by IP address

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This functionality is not currently available to organizations that have been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console. It will be available in the Adobe Admin Console in a future release.

You can configure an Adobe Workfront IP allowlist that limits access to Workfront to 75 IP addresses or IP address ranges that you specify. This provides an additional layer of security for the Workfront application.

These IP addresses or IP address ranges should be provided by your network administrator.

## Other allowlists

If your firewall or mail server is configured to allow access to only certain vendors, you must add certain IP addresses to its allowlist. This opens communication between your environment and the Adobe Workfront servers. For information about that, see [Configure your firewall's allowlist](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-firewall.md).

Also, if your organization uses the Enterprise plan, you can configure the Workfront email allowlist to control which email domains are allowed to accept emails from Workfront and which email domains can be in the email address that users specify in their Workfront user profile. For more information, see [Configure your email allowlist](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-email-allowlist.md).

## Adding IP addresses to the allowlist

After you add IP addresses to the Workfront allowlist, only those IP addresses can be used to access Workfront. Users who try to access Workfront from another IP address receive an error message indicating that their IP address is blocked.

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. Click **System** > **Customer Info.**

1. In the **IP allowlist** section, select **Enable IP allowlist.**

   This option is disabled by default.

1. Specify the IP address that you are currently using to access the Workfront system.

   Or

   Specify a range of IP addresses that includes the one you are currently using to access the Workfront system.

   The IP address you are using to access Workfront must be added to the allowlist before the allowlist is enabled.

1. Click **Add IP Range,** then specify the IP address or range of IP addresses that you want to be able to access Workfront.
1. (Optional) Repeat the previous step to add additional IP addresses or IP address ranges.

   You can add up to 75 addresses or ranges.

1. Click **Save.**
