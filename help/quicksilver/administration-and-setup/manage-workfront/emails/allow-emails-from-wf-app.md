# Allow emails from the Adobe Workfront application

If you have configured your firewall or mail server to allow access only to specific vendors, you need to add certain Adobe Workfront IP addresses to your firewall allowlist. For instructions, see [Configure your firewall's allowlist](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-firewall.md).
