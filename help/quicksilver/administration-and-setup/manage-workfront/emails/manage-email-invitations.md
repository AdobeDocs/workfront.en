As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can add users to Workfront and notify them that they have been added, by using email invitations.

The email invitation allows new users to follow a link where they can choose a password for their Workfront account. They can then finish setting up their account.

To ensure the security of the new accounts, we recommend that you use email invitations for your new users, so they can choose their own password. Alternatively, you can also select a password for a new user when creating their account. For more information about adding new users to Workfront, see [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).

You can configure the new user emails for:

* Any new user added to Workfront
* Users added to Workfront with a Requestor license

All new users see the same email when an email invitation is sent.

For information about receiving email invitations, see [Receive email invitations and create a password for Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/manage-your-account-and-profile/managing-your-workfront-account/receive-email-invitations.md).

## Generate email invitations {#generate-email-invitations}

Email invitations are generated in the following scenarios:

* When you create a new user and you select the **Send an invite email to this person** on the **New User** form. For more information about creating new users, see [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).
* When you import multiple new users and you select the **Send invite emails to these people** option. For more information about importing several new users, see [Import users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/import-users.md).
* After the users are created, you can manually generate the invitations to users who have not yet registered their account with Workfront, and they have not established a Workfront password.  
  Users who have an account created but have not yet registered their account are marked as **Unregistered** in Workfront.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If you deselect the **Send an email invite to this person** box when you create the user, the email invitation cannot be generated manually. Resending the email invitations manually is only possible for users who have been sent the original email invitation when their account was created. For more information about creating new users, see [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).

To manually generate email invitations to existing unregistered users:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Users** ![](assets/users-icon-in-main-menu.png). 
1. Select the user who shows the **Unregistered** label after their name.

1. Click the More icon ![](assets/more-icon.png), then click **Remind user to register**.

   An email invitation is sent to the new user with a new link they can use to create their Workfront password.

## Configure email invitations {#configure-email-invitations}

As a Workfront administrator, you can configure the message you include with the email invitations for new users.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the list on the left, click **Email** > **Invitations**.
