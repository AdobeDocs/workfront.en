# Overview of defining objectives for your Adobe Workfront implementation

When implementing Adobe Workfront, it is important to identify the principles of your success criteria. You may want to ask yourself the following questions:

* What is it that you are trying to solve?
* Why are you implementing Workfront?
* How do you plan to use the software to improve your processes?
* How would you know whether your implementation is successful?

There are a few factors to consider as you map your objectives and identify the business processes you want to improve. We recommend you start by documenting your current processes, organizational structure, and workflows, and then define your overall objectives for how Workfront fits in your organization. 

The following are examples of objectives defined by a company and how they fit within Workfront. You may consider some of these as you gather your requirements:

## Improve service response times within the organization

You can achieve this in Workfront by configuring the following:

* Create a Workfront Request Queue to manage specific requests within your organization.  
  
  For more information about Request Queues, see [Create a Request Queue](../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

* Create a report to show any outstanding issues not closed within 5 days.  
  
  For more information about creating reports, see [Create a custom report](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

## Improve time spent on projects and improve budget spending in the coming year

You can achieve this in Workfront by configuring the following:

* Develop a standard project methodology for your organization. This includes identifying the users who are responsible for creating and managing projects, and granting any approvals.  
  
  For more information about creating projects, see [Create a project](../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).  
  
  For more information about creating approval processes, see [Create an approval process for work items](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/configure-approval-milestone-processes/create-approval-processes.md).

* Determine whether you should organize your projects in portfolios and programs, for more in-depth budget and resource management.  
  
  For more information about creating portfolios, see [Create a portfolio](../../manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-portfolios/create-portfolios.md).

* Include a best-practices approach to deliver quality in every project.
* Identify any repeatable projects that can be used to create templates.  
  
  For more information about creating templates, see [Create a project template](../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/create-template.md).

* Create a dashboard that displays the progress of this year's portfolios of projects.  
  
  For more information about creating a dashboard, see [Create a dashboard](../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/create-dashboard.md).

## Improve the quality of services with better management of internal processes

You can achieve this in Workfront by configuring the following:

* Develop a process for delivery of services and use Workfront to manage tasks associated with any daily or weekly responsibilities. 
* Use Resource Management tools to view the allocation of resources to tasks so you can better understand how to improve productivity and quality of delivery.  
  For more information about Resource Planning, see [Resource Planning in Adobe Workfront](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planning-overview.md)

## Define success criteria

Once you identify your primary objectives, you can start defining the success criteria surrounding your Workfront implementation. The criteria should reflect the reasons you purchased Workfront in the first place.

With your success criteria in place, Workfront will be in position to manage the needs of your organization and make your implementation a success.

The following are examples of success metrics:

* All approved projects for the coming year are entered into Workfront and ready to be managed by project managers.  
* All departmental requests are managed through Workfront Request Queues.
* The processes that support internal projects are managed using Workfront.
* All repetitive processes are managed in Workfront including utilization of resources, continual project and task templates, and any internal processes necessary for quality delivery.

As you work to define these objectives and success criteria, be sure to provide opportunities for review by implementation team members and other stakeholders involved. Incorporating their feedback is key to success and facilitates a smooth adoption of the Workfront solution.
