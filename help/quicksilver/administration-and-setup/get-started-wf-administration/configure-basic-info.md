## Configure Basic Info {#configure-basic-info}

Inside the Basic Info area of your Customer Info page, some details about your customer are configured by Workfront and they display in a read-only mode. Other details can be configured by you. Any options you can edit in this area have a global effect on all users in Workfront.

To configure your Basic Info section in your Customer Info area:

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. In the left panel, click **System** > **Customer Info**. 

1. In the **Basic Info** section at the top of the **Customer Info** page, find the following information about your instance with Workfront:
