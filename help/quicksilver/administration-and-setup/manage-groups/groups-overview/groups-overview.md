description: A Workfront administrator can create groups of users that coincide with your departmental structure. Groups are similar to but distinct from teams and companies. The Workfront administrator grants groups the access to the Workfront areas where they need to work and communicate. Each group can then keep their Workfront information such as users, templates, and custom forms, and projects separate from those of other departments. At least one group administrator is required for every group. Group administrators can use the Groups page to manage their groups in one place. You can create up to 14 levels of subgroups under one group.
