title: Manage Group Statuses
description: As a group administrator, you can create custom statuses for a group that you manage. This helps to eliminate the need for dozens of company-wide custom statuses and allows more autonomy in your group hierarchies. You can also edit a system-level status for a group you manage if a Workfront administrator has unlocked the status.
