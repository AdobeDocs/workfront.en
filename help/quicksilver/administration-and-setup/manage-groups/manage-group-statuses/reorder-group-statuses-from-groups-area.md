# Reorder group statuses

As a group administrator, you can change the order of project, task, and issue statuses for a group you manage.

<!--
The system version of this snippet mentions a single group because a sysadmin call also reorder statuses there. Group admin version of this article is still needed.
-->

![Statuses](assets/statuses.png)

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* A Workfront administrator can reorder the statuses at the system level. This does not affect the order of statuses within groups. 
>
>  However, the statuses within a newly created top-level group inherit the order of the system-level statuses. (A new subgroup inherits the order of the statuses in the group one level up.)
>
>* You can reorder locked statuses. For information about locked statuses, see [Create or edit a group status](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/create-or-edit-a-group-status.md).
