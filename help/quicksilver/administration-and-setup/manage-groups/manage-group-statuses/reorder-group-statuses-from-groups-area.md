# Reorder group statuses

As a group administrator, you can change the order of project, task, and issue statuses for a group you manage.

<!--
The system version of this snippet mentions a single group because a sysadmin call also reorder statuses there. Group admin version of this article is still needed.
-->

![](assets/statuses.png)

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* A Workfront administrator can reorder the statuses at the system level. This does not affect the order of statuses within groups. 
>
>  However, the statuses within a newly created top-level group inherit the order of the system-level statuses. (A new subgroup inherits the order of the statuses in the group one level up.)
>
>* You can reorder locked statuses. For information about locked statuses, see [Create or edit a group status](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/create-or-edit-a-group-status.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan* </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups"> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> <p>You must be a group administrator of the group or a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Default order of statuses

By default, statuses display in the following order:

   <th width="33.33%">Project</th> 
   <th width="33.33%">Task</th> 
   <th width="33.33%">Issue</th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr>

     <p>Current</p> 
     <p>Dead</p> 
     <p> On Hold </p>

</table>
