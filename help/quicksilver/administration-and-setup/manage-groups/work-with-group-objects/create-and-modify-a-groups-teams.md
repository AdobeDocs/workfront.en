# Create and modify a group's teams

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with teams associated with the group and any of its subgroups.

If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

For information about how users with a Plan license can create a team, see [Create a team](../../../people-teams-and-groups/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team.md).

For information about how a Workfront administrator can create a team, see [Create a team from the Setup area](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team-from-setup.md).
