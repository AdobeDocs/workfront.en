# Create and modify a group's schedules

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with the schedules for which the administrators of the group, or one of its subgroups, have administrative access.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

For general information about creating and editing a schedule, see [Create a schedule](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Group administrators and users with a Plan license who can edit other users can add a system-level or a group-level schedule to another user when they are editing that user's profile.

For information about how schedules are used in resource planning, see [Schedules overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/schedules-overview.md) and [Resource Planner overview](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).
