# Group-level approval processes

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with the approval processes for which the administrators of the group, or one of its subgroups, have administrative access.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

For instructions, see [Create an approval process for work items](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/configure-approval-milestone-processes/create-approval-processes.md).

For more information about approval processes, see [Approval process overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approval-process-in-workfront.md).
