# View and manage a group's recently restored items

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with its recently restored projects, tasks, issues, documents, and templates in the following ways:

* View, filter, and group a list of recently restored items
* Export a list of recently restored items

If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

For more information about restored items, see [Restore deleted items](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/manage-deleted-items/restore-deleted-items.md).
