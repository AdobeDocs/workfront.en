# Create and modify a group's project templates

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with project templates associated with the group and any of its subgroups.

If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> <p>You must be a group administrator of the group or a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher on the templates you want to view and work with</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## View, work with, and create templates for your group from the Groups area

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the left panel, click **Groups** ![](assets/groups-icon.png).

1. Click the name of the group for which you want to create or modify templates.
1. In the left panel, click **Templates** to list the templates that are associated with the group and with any subgroups it might have.

   You must have View access to a template to see it in this list. For information about this access, see [Grant access to templates](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-templates.md).

1. Do any of the following:

## How preferences apply to templates and template tasks {#how-preferences-apply-to-templates-and-template-tasks}

When you create a project template, the settings listed in the tables below are configured automatically by a correlating project or task preference.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Either a group-level or system-level project or task preference affects a project template, depending on whether you associated the template with a group when you created it. 
>
>If you did associate it with a group, the group-level preference takes effect. This occurs in the following scenarios:
>
>* You create the template from the Groups area, as explained in this article
>* You specify a group when creating the template using a Kickstart file
>* You specify a group when creating the template using the API
>
>If you didn't associate the new template with a group, the system-level preference takes effect. This occurs when in the scenarios below. (If you later assign a group to the template or template task, the group's preferences don't affect it.) 
>
>* You create the template from the Templates area
>* You don't specify a group when creating the template using a Kickstart file
>* You don't specify a group when creating the template using the API
>

* [Template task settings configured by task preferences](#template-task-settings-configured-by-task-preferences)

### Project template settings configured by project and task preferences {#project-template-settings-configured-by-project-and-task-preferences}

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Performance Index Method</p> </td>

For information about the project preferences listed in this table, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

For information about the task and issue preference, see [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* If you change the group that is associated with an existing project template, the template's settings remain the same.
>* If you move an existing template task to another template, the following settings remain unchanged in the template task, regardless of the group associated with the new template:>
>   * Duration Type
>   * Revenue Type
>   * Cost Type
>
>  However, the template task is affected by the setting "When someone is assigned to a task" on the new template. For more information, see the section [Access](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/edit-templates.md#access) in the article [Edit project templates](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/edit-templates.md). 
>
>* When an administrator saves a project as a template, all settings for the template are inherited from the project, including the group.
>
>  When an administrator converts a task or issue to a project using a template, all settings for the template are determined by what's already saved on the template.

### Template task settings configured by task preferences {#template-task-settings-configured-by-task-preferences}

When you create a template task, some of its settings are configured automatically by a correlating task preference. These settings are listed in the table below. 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Duration Type </p> </td>

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Revenue Type</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Configured by the group-level task preference "Revenue Type" if you associate the template with a group, or the same system-level task and issue preference if you don't.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Cost Type </p> </td> 
   <td> <p> Configured by the group-level task preference "Cost Type" if you associate the template with a group, or the same system-level task and issue preference if you don't.</p> </td> 
  </tr>
