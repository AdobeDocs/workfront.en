# Create and modify a group's layout templates

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with the Layout Template for which the administrators of the group, or one of its subgroups, have administrative access.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).
