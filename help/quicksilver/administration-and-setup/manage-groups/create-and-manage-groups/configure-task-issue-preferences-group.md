# Configure task and issue preferences for a group

If groups in your organization need to configure a task or issue preference independently from the way it is configured at the system level, an Adobe Workfront administrator can unlock the preference. Then, as a group administrator, you can configure the preference for your group and it will affect all tasks or issues associated with your group.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

For information about how the Workfront administrator unlocks preferences, see [Lock or unlock project preferences for all groups in the system](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/lock-or-unlock-project-preferences-for-groups-system.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>Group-level configuration is also possible for project preferences. For information, see [Configure project preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-project-preferences-group.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Typically, an unlocked preference remains unlocked indefinitely. If the Workfront administrator re-locks it, the system setting takes effect again and settings for the preference made by the group administrators are lost.
>* The preferences set for the group that is associated with a project take precedence over the preferences set for the Home Group of the user who creates the project.
>* Some group-level preferences affect project templates that you create for the group. For more information, see the section [View, work with, and create templates for your group from the Groups area](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-templates.md#view) in the article [Create and modify a group's project templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-templates.md).
>
>* After a Workfront administrator unlocks a preference at the system level, you can configure it and then lock it to ensure that everyone in your group and in its subgroups is using the same configuration. This is parallel to the ability that a Workfront administrator has to configure and lock a preference for everyone in the system. For more information, see [Lock or unlock a project, task, or issue preference for subgroups](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/lock-or-unlock-a-group-preference.md).

## Configure unlocked task and issue preferences for a top-level group

>[!TIP]
>
>If you are a Workfront administrator, you can bypass steps 1-4 by going to Setup > Project Preferences > Tasks & Issues, then searching for the group's name in the box at the top of the page.

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. In the left panel, click **Groups** ![](assets/groups-icon.png).

1. Click the name of the group for which you want to configure unlocked task and issue preferences.
1. On the page that displays for the group, in the left panel, click **Task & Issue Preferences**.
1. On the page that appears, continue with one of the 5 sections listed below these steps to configure settings for the areas New Task Defaults, Issues, Deletion, Actual Dates, and Access, then click **Save**.

   If you hover over the lock icon ![](assets/lock-toggle-button-dimmed.png) for a preference that you need to configure and a tool tip displays to tell you that is locked, you can ask your Workfront administrator to unlock it for all groups in the organization.

   When it is unlocked, you and other group administrators can configure it separately for your own groups. Also, you can lock it for your group and any subgroups below your group.

   <!--
   This was a Ninja story in Summer/Fall 2020 that may never be implemented Leaving it here drafted in case Ninja decides to add it. Here's what Jeremy Flores says on 12/1/20:
   
   I have not had a chance to follow up with customers to verify if this is still a need. It has not come up organically. I can follow up with a few customers, but overall I would say that we're probably safe to move on and just mark what we've done to support this as complete. It could still come up but I don't want to push it unless customers really want it.
   You can replace the Work On It button with a Start button. When a user assigned to a task or issue clicks Start, the status and Actual Start Date of the work item update automatically, letting others know that the user started work.
   Workfront's default Work On It button also signals that a user started work on a task or issue, but it doesn't update the status and Actual Start Date.

   To switch to the Start button:
   
   Select Change the Work On It button to a Start button to automatically update the status of an item. 
   In the lists of check boxes that display below this option, select one or more statuses for each work item type. With multiple statuses selected here, when a user clicks Start on a work item, a drop-down menu lets the user choose a status for the item. 
     
   Making this change does not affect tasks and issues where the Actual Start Date was already updated. For these, the button displays as Work On It even if it is replaced with the Start button.
   If you select New as a status for a work item type (in step 2 above), the Actual Start Date does not update when a user clicks the Start button and then chooses New. This is because a Workfront item is not yet in progress (therefore not yet started) when New is its current status.
   This setting is not currently available in
   
   The Workfront Mobile App
   Workfront for Office 365
   Workfront email notifications
   
   This setting can be configured both at the system level and at the Team level. Enabling the Start button for everyone in the system automatically disables the same setting at the Team level.
   If the Work On It setting is enabled, then disabled, tasks and issues function with a Work On It button the way they did before.
