# Lock or unlock a group timesheet and hour preference

If you are a group administrator, you can configure and then lock a timesheet and hour preference for your group after a Workfront administrator unlocks it at the system level.

Locking an Adobe Workfront preference ensures that everyone in your group and in its subgroups is using the same setting for that preference. Though you can still reconfigure a preference that you lock, group administrators can't do so for lower subgroups.

Conversely, unlocking a preference  at the group level allows subgroup administrators more flexibility to manage the way their groups work with those items. When a preference is unlocked, group administrators can reconfigure it for those subgroups.

This is parallel to the ability that a Workfront administrator has to lock or unlock a preference for everyone in the system.

For information about how a Workfront administrator can lock or unlock a timesheet and hour preference for all groups in the system, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).

For information about configuring a timesheet and hour preference for a group, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-timesheet-hour-preferences-group.md).

<!--
Unlike other Lock/Unlock articles that start just like this one, we need the steps here. In other areas, the lock/unlock step is part of the article about setting preferences or creating statuses.</p>
-->

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Configuring an unlocked preference for a group doesn't affect that preference for any subgroups below the group.
>
>  However, when a new subgroup is created, it inherits the preference settings and locked or unlocked state of the group immediately above it.
>
>* If you move a group under a group that has a locked preference, the moved group inherits that preference and it is locked for the moved group. 
>* If you move a group under a group that has an unlocked preference, the moved group is not affected by that preference.
>
>  If the preference in the moved group is locked at the time of the move, it remains locked, but the group administrator can unlock it now because it is unlocked for the parent group.

## Lock or unlock a group timesheet and hour preference

>[!TIP]
>
>If you are a Workfront administrator, you can bypass steps 1-4 by going to Setup > Timesheet & Hours > Preferences, then searching for the group's name in the box at the top of the page.

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. In the left panel, click **Groups**.
1. Click the name of the group where you want to lock or unlock a timesheets and hours preference.
1. In the left panel, click **Timesheets and Hours Preferences**.

1. On the page that appears, do any of the following:

   * If you want administrators of groups below your group to be able to configure a preference for their groups, unlock it ![Unlock toggle](assets/unlock-toggle-button.png).
   * If you want all groups below yours to use your configuration for a preference, make sure that it is locked ![Lock toggle](assets/lock-toggle-button.png) (this is the default).

     >[!IMPORTANT]
     >
     >It's important to communicate with the administrators and users in groups below yours to ensure that all needs are accounted for in the way you configure a locked preference. When you lock it, your configuration for it is inherited by any subgroups below. And if the preference has been unlocked for any period of time, your configuration replaces those that group administrators in lower subgroups might have made.

1. Click **Save**.
