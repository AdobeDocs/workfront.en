As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can create groups to organize users and projects and to assign access rights within Workfront. For more information, see [Groups overview](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/groups-overview/groups.md).

Every subgroup needs at least one group administrator. Group administrators can use the Groups page to manage their groups in one place.

If you are a group administrator or a Workfront administrator, you can also create subgroups under a group. For instructions, see [Create a subgroup](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-subgroups/create-a-subgroup.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">

   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Create a top-level group from scratch

These steps explain how to create a new group from scratch. For information about creating a group or subgroup by copying an existing one, see [Create a top-level group by copying an existing group or subgroup](#create-a-top-level-group-by-copying-an-existing-group-or-subgroup) in this article.

You must be a Workfront administrator to create a top-level group.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the left panel, click **Groups** ![](assets/groups-icon.png).

1. Above the list of groups, click **New Group**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >At the bottom of the list of groups, you can also click **Add More Groups** to add a group in-line, then click **Enter** when you are finished adding the group information.

1. In the **New Group** box that displays, type a name for the group.
1. Specify the following information:

## Create a top-level group by copying an existing group or subgroup {#create-a-top-level-group-by-copying-an-existing-group-or-subgroup}

As a Workfront administrator, you can create a new top-level group by copying an existing group or subgroup.

Keep the following in mind when you want to do this:

* All of the members and any subgroups belonging to the existing group are copied to the new top-level group.
* The members of the copied group retain the assignments they had in the original group. Therefore, the group administrators of the original group are also designated as the group administrators in the copied group.

To create a new top-level group by copying a group or subgroup:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the left panel, click **Groups** ![](assets/groups-icon.png).

   In the list that displays, you can see the groups you manage, along with any subgroups they have. Adobe Workfront administrators can see all groups.

1. Select the group you want to copy, then click the Copy icon ![](assets/copy-icon.png).
1. In the **Copy Group** box that appears, type a **Group Name** for the copied group.  

1. Specify the following information:

   <table style="table-layout:auto">
