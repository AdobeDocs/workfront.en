# Configure timesheet and hour preferences for a group

An Adobe Workfront administrator can unlock the following sections of timesheet and hour preferences at the system level so that group administrators can configure them independently for their own groups:

* General Preferences
* Pre-Populate timesheets with

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

The following sections on the Timesheet and Hours Preferences page are configurable only at the system level and can't be unlocked for groups:

* Logging Time 
* Project, Task or Issue Deletion Preferences

For information about how a Workfront administrator unlocks a timesheet and hour preference, see the section [Unlock timesheet and hour preferences for groups](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md#lock) in the article [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>Group-level configuration is also possible for project preferences and for task and issue preferences. For information, see [Configure project preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-project-preferences-group.md) and [Configure task and issue preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-task-issue-preferences-group.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> <p>You must be a group administrator of the group or a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Group timesheet and hour preferences

Consider the following information about configuring an unlocked timesheet or hour preference for a group:

* If you are a group administrator and you configure a timesheet or hour preference for your group, it affects people who use the group as their Home Group.
* Typically, an unlocked preference remains unlocked indefinitely. If the Workfront administrator re-locks it, the system setting takes effect again and settings for the preference made by the group administrators are lost.
* A timesheet inherits the timesheet and hour preferences configured for the timesheet owner’s Home Group.
* After a Workfront administrator unlocks a preference at the system level and you configure it for your group, you can then lock it to ensure that everyone in the groups below yours is using the same configuration. This is parallel to the ability that a Workfront administrator has to configure and lock a preference for everyone in the system. For more information, see [Lock or unlock a group timesheet and hour preference](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/lock-or-unlock-a-group-timesheet-hour-preference.md).

       </ul> <p>This is useful when users plan to be away from the office and want to log that time beforehand.</p> <p>Note: You cannot prevent users from logging time on tasks or issues that are closed or canceled. You can only prevent users from logging time on complete or dead projects. We recommend that you use filters in lists of tasks and issues to exclude&nbsp;the ones that have been completed or canceled from being visible to users.</p> </td>

1. In the **Pre-Populate timesheets with**section, configure any of the following options:

      <td> <p>Defines the number of weeks before and after the date range&nbsp;of the timesheet that contains dates of tasks and issues assigned to the user. The default setting is 1 week, and you can extend this range to 4 weeks. This means that the timesheet is pre-populated with tasks and issues which have dates anywhere between four weeks before the date range of the timesheet up to four weeks after the date range of the timesheet, if you select 4 weeks for your range. </p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr>

      <td>If multiple resources are typically assigned to a single task, we recommend this setting. This means when one resource records time against the task and marks it as complete, the other resources assigned to the task can still find the task or the issue in their timesheet, to record their hours.</td>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Tasks &amp; Issues that have Planned Dates in timesheet's date range</td>

      <td role="rowheader"> Tasks that have Projected Dates in timesheet's date range</td> 
      <td> <p>When selected, the timesheet includes tasks that have either a Projected Start Date or Completion Date that falls within the time frame of the project, even if the planned date of the issue or task falls outside of the timesheet date range.</p> </td>
