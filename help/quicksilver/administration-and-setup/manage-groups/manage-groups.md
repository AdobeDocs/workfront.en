# Manage groups

A Workfront administrator can create groups of users that coincide with your departmental structure. Groups are similar to but distinct from teams and companies.

The Workfront administrator grants groups the access to the Workfront areas where they need to work and communicate. Each group can then keep their Workfront information such as users, templates, and custom forms, and projects separate from those of other departments.
