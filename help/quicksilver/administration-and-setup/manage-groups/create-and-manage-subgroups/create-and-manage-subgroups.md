title: Create and manage subgroups
description: As an group administrator of a subgroup, you can create, move, view, edit, copy, rename, export, and delete the subgroup. You can also make a subgroup a top-level group by removing it from its parent group. If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).
