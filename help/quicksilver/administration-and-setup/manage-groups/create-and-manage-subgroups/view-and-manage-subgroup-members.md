# View and manage subgroup members

When you are viewing a group that you manage, you can view and manage all of the users in the group's subgroups.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans" target="_blank">Workfront plan</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://one.workfront.com/s/document-item?bundleId=the-new-workfront-experience&amp;topicId=Content%2FAdministration_and_Setup%2FAdd_users%2FAccess_levels_and_object_permissions%2Fwf-licenses.html&amp;_LANG=en" target="_blank">Adobe Workfront license</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> <p>You must be a group administrator of the group or a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to users, with the User Admin (All Users) option selected</p> <p><b>Note</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
