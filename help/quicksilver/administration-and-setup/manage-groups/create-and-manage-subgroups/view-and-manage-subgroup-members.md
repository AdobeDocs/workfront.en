# View and manage subgroup members

When you are viewing a group that you manage, you can view and manage all of the users in the group's subgroups.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

## View and manage members of the subgroups under a group

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. Click **Groups**.

   In the list that displays, you can see the groups you manage, along with any subgroups they have. Adobe Workfront administrators can see all groups.

1. Click the name of the group for which you want to view or manage subgroup members.
1. In the left panel, click **Subgroup Members**.

   This left panel item is available only if the group has subgroups.

1. Do any of the following:

   * Select a member in the list, then click Edit ![](assets/edit-icon.png) to modify that person's user profile.

     For more information, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md) or [Edit user profiles in bulk](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-user-profiles-in-bulk.md).
   
   * Select any number of members in the list, then click Update ![](assets/comment-icon.png) to add a comment to their user profiles.

     The user or users receive an in-app notification as well as an email notification with your comment. The comment shows in the Updates area in the user's profile.
   
   * Select any number of members in the list, then click Deactivate ![](assets/deactivate-user.png) or Activate ![](assets/activate-user.png).

     For more information, see [Deactivate or reactivate a user](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/deactivate-a-user.md).
   
   * Export ![](assets/export.png) the list of members.
