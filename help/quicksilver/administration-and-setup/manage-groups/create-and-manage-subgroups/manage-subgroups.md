# Manage a subgroup

As an group administrator of a subgroup, you can create, move, view, edit, copy, rename, export, and delete the subgroup.

You can also make a subgroup a top-level group by removing it from its parent group.

If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

For more information about subgroups, see [Subgroups overview](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/groups-overview/subgroups.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> <p>You must be a group administrator of the group or a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Create, move, view, edit, copy, rename, export, or delete a subgroup

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the left panel, click **Groups** ![](assets/groups-icon.png).

   In the list that displays, you can see the groups you manage, along with any subgroups they have. Adobe Workfront administrators can see all groups.

1. Click the name of the group that contains the subgroup you want to work on.

   Or

   If you are moving one or more subgroups, click the name of the destination group (you will specify which subgroups you want to move in a later step).

1. In the left menu, click **Subgroups**.

1. Do any of the following:

   <table>

>[!TIP]
>
>When you are managing a group that contains subgroups, it's helpful to be able to identify and filter data about the entire group and all of its subgroups. You can do this by using the Top Parent ID field in a report or list.
>
>For example, imagine that you manage a large Marketing department and you want a list of all of the projects that the entire department is working on.
>
>In Workfront, this Marketing department is represented by a group called Marketing, with 3 subgroups called Field Marketing, Product Marketing, and Digital Marketing. To list the projects that belong to the entire Marketing department (all 4 groups), you could create a Filter for the Projects area with the following Filter Rule:
>
>```>
>Group: Top Parent ID > Equal > Marketing
>```>
>You can also use the Top Parent Name field to identify data associated with a top-level group, but only in Views, not in Filters or Groupings.

## Remove a subgroup from its parent group and make it a top-level group

You can make a subgroup a top-level group by removing it from its parent group.

>[!TIP]
>
>When you deactivate a group that has subgroups below it, those subgroups also become inactive. If you want one of them to be active, you can use these instructions to remove it from its parent group, then reactivate it.
>
>For instructions on deactivating and reactivating groups, see the sections [View and manage a group's details](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-manage-a-groups-details.md#view) and [View and manage a group's details](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-manage-a-groups-details.md#inactive) in the article [View and manage a group's details](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-manage-a-groups-details.md).

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. In the left panel, click **Groups** ![](assets/groups-icon.png).

1. Select the parent group of the group you want to make a top-level group, then click the Edit icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png). 
1. In the **Edit Group** box that appears, under **Group Members and Group Administrators**, start typing the name of the subgroup that you want to make a top-level group, then click the X to the right of its name it when it appears.
1. Click **Save**.

## View and manage a group's subgroup members

When you are viewing the main page of a group you administer, you can view and manage all of the users in the group's subgroups. For instructions, see [View and manage subgroup members](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-subgroups/view-and-manage-subgroup-members.md).

## About copying a subgroup {#about-copying-a-subgroup}

Consider the following when you copy a subgroup.

* If a subgroup you copy has its own subgroups, they are included in the copy and their names are formatted as follows:

  *Original subgroup name* (Copy)

* Any subgroup that belongs to a public group is also public, so any user with edit-user access, in or out of the group, can add users to the subgroup.
