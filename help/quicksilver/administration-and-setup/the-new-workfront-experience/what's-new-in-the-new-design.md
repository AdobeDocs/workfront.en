### Choose when the Summary opens on a task list

You can now choose when to open the Summary view of a task on the task list. Once you've opened the Summary, it remains open as you click through tasks until you manually close it.

Previously, the Summary opened automatically when clicking a task.

### Find help and resources without leaving Workfront

The Resource Center (the Help button in the bottom-right corner of the screen) is your self-service knowledge base. View training materials, interact with other Workfront users, and give product feedback here. Check back often to take advantage of new resources.

### Update percent complete using the Summary

Use the progress bar at the top of the Summary to update the percent complete for the task you've selected. Enter a number or drag the bar to the correct percentage.

The Users page is now available in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

The following tabs have been removed from the Users page:

### Proofs open in a new Workfront tab

When you open a proof from anywhere in Workfront, you no longer have to press the Option key (Mac) or the Alt key (Windows) to launch the proofing viewer in a new Workfront tab. The new tab automatically opens to the immediate right of the tab you were using when you opened the proof.

When you are finished using the proofing viewer, you can simply close the tab where you were using it and return to what you were doing in the tab to the immediate left.

### Improved design for Tabs

The Tabs design is now updated to scale when large numbers of tabs are open. The specific improvements include:

* You now see more visible characters per tab.
* A new tooltip displays when hovering over a tab that shows the object type, full title, and a partial description. 
* A More menu (3 dots icon) displays after the tabs that allow you to clear all tabs or reopen the last tab.

### Improved design for Search

Search now displays below the Global Navigation Bar. Only the first 5 favorited areas on the Search page are displayed for each object (projects, dashboards, and so forth).

You can now use SAML to access the new Workfront experience.
