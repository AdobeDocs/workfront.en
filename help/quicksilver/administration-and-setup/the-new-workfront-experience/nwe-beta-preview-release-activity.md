To make edits much faster, we have introduced a new saving option when editing tasks in a list called Timeline Planning mode. Prior to this mode, you could save the changes you made to your task lists either automatically with Autosave, or manually, when disabling the Autosave move.</p> <p>Consider the following benefits when using the Timeline Planning mode for saving your changes in a task list:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Workfront applies a new view, with fewer fields to your task list. This ensures that you can focus on the most important fields that might affect the project timeline.</li> 
     <li>Submitting each change is faster than when using the Automatic or Manual save modes.</li> 
     <li>You can reverse your changes before you save them.</li>
