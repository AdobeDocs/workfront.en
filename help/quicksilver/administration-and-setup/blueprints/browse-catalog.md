# Browse the blueprints catalog and request installation of blueprints

Blueprints provide basic building blocks to help you create a work management system that grows with you. All Adobe Workfront users can browse the catalog of blueprints. You can additionally make a request to have your Workfront administrator install a specific blueprint for you, if your administrator has enabled blueprint requests.

Only the system administrator can install blueprints. For information, see [Install a blueprint](../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-install.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan</strong></td> 
   <td> <p> Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr>
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Browse the blueprints catalog

The catalog displays all of the blueprints that are available for your organization. For information about blueprints such as blueprint types and maturity levels, see [Blueprints overview](../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-overview.md).

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Blueprints**.
1. Browse the catalog of blueprints.
1. Use the filter panel on the right to filter the catalog by the following options:

   * Use case (such as Human Resources or Marketing)
   * Maturity level (managed or integrated)
   * Installation status (installed or not installed)
   * Blueprint type (organizational structure or project template)

1. (Optional) Click **Details** on a blueprint to learn how it works.

   For information about the content available on the Details page, see [Blueprints overview](../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-overview.md).

## Request installation of a blueprint

You can request the installation of a blueprint if a system administrator configures blueprint requests. For more information, see [Configure access to blueprints](../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/configure-access-to-blueprints.md).

When you request to have a blueprint installed, the request is sent to the system administrator. You are notified when the request is completed, according to your notification preferences.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click**Blueprints**.
1. Find the blueprint you want to install. You can filter by use case, maturity level, installation status, and type using the filters in the right panel.
1. Click **Request** on the blueprint.

   If the **Request** button does not appear on the blueprint, your system administrator has not enabled requests.
