# Browse the blueprints catalog and request installation of blueprints

The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

Blueprints provide basic building blocks to help you create a work management system that grows with you. All Adobe Workfront users can browse the catalog of blueprints. You can additionally make a request to have your system administrator install a specific blueprint for you, if your administrator has enabled requests.

Only the system administrator can install blueprints. For information, see [Install a blueprint](../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-install.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p> Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> <!--
   <tr data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> 
    <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
    <td> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> 
   </tr>
  --> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Browse the blueprints catalog

The catalog displays all of the blueprints that are available for your organization. For information about blueprints such as blueprint types and maturity levels, see [Blueprints overview](../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-overview.md).

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Blueprints**.
1. Browse the catalog of blueprints.

   You can filter by use case, maturity level, installation status, and type on the right-hand side.

1. (Optional) Click **Details** on a blueprint to learn how it works.

   For information about the content available on the Details page, see [Blueprints overview](../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-overview.md).

## Request installation of a blueprint

Your system administrator can optionally allow you to request installation of a blueprint.

When you request to have a blueprint installed, the request is sent to the system administrator. You are notified when the request is completed, according to your notification preferences.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click**Blueprints**.
1. Find the blueprint you want to install. You can filter by use case, maturity level, installation status, and type on the right-hand side.
1. Click **Request** on the blueprint.

   If the **Request** button does not appear on the blueprint, your system administrator has not enabled requests.
