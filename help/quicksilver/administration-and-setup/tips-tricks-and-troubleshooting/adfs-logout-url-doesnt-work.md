# ADFS logout URL doesn't work

<!-- Audited: 1/2024 -->

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that are not yet onboarded to the [!UICONTROL Adobe Admin Console].
>
>If your organization has been onboarded to the [!UICONTROL Adobe Admin Console], see [Platform-based administration differences ([!DNL Adobe Workfront]/[!DNL Adobe Business Platform])](../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

## Problem

When using the ADFS logout URL (https://myadfsserver.domain.net/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignout1.0), you receive a message page with the error: "There was a problem accessing the site. Try to browse to the site again."

If the problem persists, contact the administrator of this site and provide the following reference number to identify the problem: **57092dfc-751a-4915-8e6a-b4c5d413f8c6**

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe [!DNL Workfront] license</td> 
   <td> 
   <p>New: Standard</p>
   <p>Current: Plan</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a [!DNL Workfront] administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

For more detail about the information in this table, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md).

## Solution

1. In your ADFS manager server, go to **[!UICONTROL Trust Relationships]** > **[!UICONTROL Relying Party Trusts]** > `<your party trust>` properties.

1. Under the **[!UICONTROL Endpoints]** tab, click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

1. **[!UICONTROL Endpoint Type]** = SAML Logout, Binding = POST, URL = https://myadfsserver.domain.net/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignout1.0

   You can set a response URL if you want it to redirect to another page. But we recommend the ADFS site because it warns that you are logged off, but you should still close your browser.
