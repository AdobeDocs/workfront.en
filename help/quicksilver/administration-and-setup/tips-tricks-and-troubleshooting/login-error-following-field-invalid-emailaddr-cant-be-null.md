# Login Error: The following fields are invalid: emailAddr cannot be null

## Problem

When I try to log into [!DNL Adobe] [!DNL Workfront] with my URL (https://customerdomain.my.workfront.com), I am redirected to the SAML login portal and then redirected back to Workfront with the following error:

"Let's try that again. The following fields are invalid: emailAddr cannot be null."

## Cause

This error is caused by an incorrect item in the Map User Attributes area of the SAML 2.0 configuration. For more information about mapping user attributes for SAML 2.0, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 2.0](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/configure-workfront-saml-2.md).

## Solution

Update the Attribute Mapping for the email address, and click **Save**.
