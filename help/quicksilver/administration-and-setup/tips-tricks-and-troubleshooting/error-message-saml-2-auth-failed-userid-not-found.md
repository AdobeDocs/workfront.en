# Error message: SAML 2.0 Authentication Failed: User Identifier Not Found

## Problem

I am receiving this error when using SAML 2.0: "SAML 2.0 Authentication Failed: User Identifier Not Found."

## Cause

This happens when a **UID** or **NAME ID** is not passed from the **ADFS Claim rules**.

In ADFS the **Relying Party Trust** needs to have a **Claim rule** that passes either a **UID** or a **NAME ID** value. When you run a **[!DNL Workfront] Test Connection**, it should show this if successful.

## Solution

1. When editing the **[!UICONTROL ADFS INFO]**, in the **[!UICONTROL Relying Party Trusts]** > Select object >**[!UICONTROL Edit Claim Rules]**.

1. The **[!UICONTROL LDAP Attribute]** (left column) should have **[!UICONTROL E-Mail Addresses]** (or any unique identifier).

1. The **[!UICONTROL Outgoing Claim Type]** (right column) should be **[!UICONTROL Name ID]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >It does not have to have the LDAP Attribute E-Mail Addresses. Any unique identifier that will identify the user can be used but it must be passed into [!DNL Adobe Workfront] as the **NAME ID**.
