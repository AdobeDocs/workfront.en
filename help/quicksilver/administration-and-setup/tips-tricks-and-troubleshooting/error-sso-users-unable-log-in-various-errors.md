# Error: SSO Users are Unable to Log In to [!DNL Adobe Workfront] Due to Various Errors

## Problem

I am unable to log in to [!DNL Workfront] and received one of the following errors:

* Sorry, you can't access [!DNL Workfront] through this login screen. [!DNL Workfront] is set up for Federated Single Sign-On with SAML 2.0. Please contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.
* That username/password combination wasn't quite right. Make sure your caps lock isn't on and try again.
* Sorry, you do not have access to Workfront. Please contact your Workfront administrator to get a username and password.

## Solution

Your [!DNL Workfront] instance uses SSO, and you are trying to log in through an incorrect URL. Make sure you're logging in using the correct URL without anything after ".com"

>[!TIP]

>Remove any existing bookmarks that have invalid URLs.
