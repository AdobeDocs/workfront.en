# Edit an approval process

If you are an Adobe Workfront administrator, or you have administrative access to approval processes, you can see and edit all approval processes in the system.

If you are a group administrator, you can see and edit the approval processes associated with the group or groups you manage.

For information about creating approval processes, see [Create an approval process for work items](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/configure-approval-milestone-processes/create-approval-processes.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* When you edit a global approval process that is already in use, your changes affect all objects throughout the system that are already associated with it.
>* If you add a new approver to the current stage on an approval process that has already started on an object, the process for that object resets and the approvers have to start over.
>
>  However, if you make the following changes in an approval process that has already started on an object, that process continues without interruption:
>
>* Add a stage beyond the current stage
>* Add an additional approver before the current stage

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td>

   <td> <p>Administrative access to Approval Processes if you are not a System Administrator</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

1. Configure a path for the approval process using the following options.

   A path is where you specify what needs to happen in the approval process. You create stages in a path to indicate who needs to do the approval work and in what order.

      <td> <p>Begin typing the name of the user, team, or job role that you want to designate as an approver for this stage, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list. You can add only active users, job roles, and teams. </p> 
      <p><b>NOTE</b>: Adding a user, team, or role as an approver does not automatically give them permissions to the object associated with that approval. They receive permissions to the object when the approval step is triggered. Otherwise, the objects must be shared with them before they can make an approval decision. </p> 
      <p>You can also designate an individual as an approver by specifying the individual's role. For example, you can assign a Project Owner, Project Sponsor, Portfolio Owner, Program Owner, or Manager as an approver. These options automatically appear when you begin typing.</p> 
      <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  
      <ul> 
      <li> When you assign an approval to the Project Sponsor and no one is designated as the sponsor of a project, the approval is reassigned to the Project Owner. If no one is designated as the owner of the project, the approval is assigned to the Workfront administrator. </li> 
      <li> When you assign an approval to a role and the option <b>Approver not required to be on the project team</b> is disabled, but no roles in the project team  match the role on the approval, the approval is reassigned to the Project Owner. For information about approval settings, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/configure-approval-milestone-processes/establish-approval-settings.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure global approval settings</a>.
      </li> 
      <li>When you assign an approval to the Project Owner and no one is designated as the owner of a project, the approval is reassigned to the main Workfront administrator as indicated in the Customer Info section in the Setup area.

The default assigned resource on the task, or the owner of the project is assigned to the issue. By default, the name of the issue created is <b>Approval Rejected (&lt;Project or Task Name&gt;)</b>. This is a Rejection Issue, entered under the task or the project, depending on the approval process where the rejection happened.</li>

       <ul> 
       <li>Previous Status: The rejected project, task, or issue reverts to the status prior to the status that activates the approval process.</li> 
       <li> <p>Any other status in the list: The rejected object moves to the status you choose, such as On Hold. You can choose one of the default statuses or a custom statuses you added to your Workfront system.</p> 
       <p><b>TIP</b>:</b> <p>If you select a status associated with an approval process as the rejection status, the rejected object moves to the selected status bypassing the approval process for the rejection status.</p> 
       <p> For example, if you select On Hold for the rejection status and the On Hold status is associated with an approval process, the rejected object is placed in the On Hold status without requiring the approval. </p>
       <!--The caveat about the rejection status in an approval below might change; this is on the Product roadmap and might be fixed. Right now, this is a bug but we had to document it due to a request from customers - September 2021)

      <p>For a system-wide approval process, only system-wide statuses are available.</p> 
      <p>For a group-specific approval process, all group statuses are available. This includes any custom statuses that the group administrator created specifically for the group, as well as any system-wide statuses. </p>

1. (Optional) Click **Add path** to add another path to the approval process, referring to the list of options in the previous step.

   The new path must be associated with another status. The path triggers when the item is updated to show this status. You cannot have two paths for the same status.

1. Click **Save**.
1. (Optional) Do any of the following:

   * Associate the approval process with specific projects, tasks, or issues throughout your system, as described in [Associate a new or existing approval process with work](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/associate-approval-with-work.md).
   * Outside of Workfront, notify users that the approval process is available for them to associate with their projects, tasks, or issues, as described in [Associate a new or existing approval process with work](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/associate-approval-with-work.md).
   * Create another approval process that is triggered if this approval process is rejected and the item takes on another status. This gives you a way to link approval processes together.
