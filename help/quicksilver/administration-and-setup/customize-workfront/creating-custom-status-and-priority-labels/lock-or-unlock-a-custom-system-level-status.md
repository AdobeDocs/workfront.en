# Locked and unlocked system-level statuses

Locking custom statuses is a way to ensure that people throughout your organization are using the same processes in their flow of work. When a status is locked, it's available to all users in the system. Though you can edit or delete a status that you lock, group administrators can't do so for their groups; they can change only its display order in the Status list.

Conversely, unlocking custom statuses allows group administrators more flexibility to manage the unique workflows used in their groups. When a status is unlocked, group administrators can change its attributes or delete it for their groups.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you lock a custom status after it has been unlocked for any period of time, your system-wide settings for the status replace those made by group administrators. While the status is locked, group administrators cannot modify or delete the status for their groups.

For instructions on locking or unlocking a system-level status, see [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).
