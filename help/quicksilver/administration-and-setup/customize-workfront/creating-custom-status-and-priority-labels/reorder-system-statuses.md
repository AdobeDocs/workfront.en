# Reorder system-level and group statuses

As a Workfront administrator, you can change the order of project, task, and issue statuses for everyone in the system or for a single group.

<!--The system version of this snippet mentions a single group because a sysadmin call also reorder statuses there. Group admin version of this article is still needed.-->

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Reordering the statuses at the system level doesn't affect the order of statuses within groups.
>
>  However, the statuses within a newly created top-level group inherit the order of the system-level statuses. (A new subgroup inherits the order of the statuses in the group one level up.)
>
>* You can reorder locked statuses. For information about locked statuses, see [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).
>* Group administrators can also reorder statuses used in their groups. For more information, see [Reorder group statuses](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/reorder-group-statuses-from-groups-area.md).
