   For details about each of the built-in system task statuses, see [System task statuses](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/system-task-statuses.md).

## About creating custom task statuses

As a Workfront administrator you can add custom system task statuses to Workfront.

As a group owner, you can add custom task statuses for your group.

When you create a custom task status, you must always equate the new status with an existing system status. You must understand the behavior of the system statuses to know which status is appropriate to equate your custom status with. After you have selected your equal status, this selection cannot be changed.

For more information about creating custom statuses, editing system ones, or selecting new default statuses for your tasks, see [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).
