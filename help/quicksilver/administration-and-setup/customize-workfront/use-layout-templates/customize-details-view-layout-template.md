# Customize the Details view using a layout template

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use a layout template to determine what information appears when a user clicks the Details icon ![](assets/project-details-icon.png) in the left panel while viewing a task, issue, document, program, or portfolio.

<!--
<MadCap:conditionalText class="preview" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
, or billing record
</MadCap:conditionalText>
-->

You can also change the order of the information in which this information appears. For example, for all tasks that your users see, you can move Custom Forms information to the top of the Details view for all tasks that your users see.

The changes you make to the Details view for an object also determine the availability and order of fields that users see in the following areas:

* "New object" boxes, such as New Task and New Issue

  ![](assets/new-task-dialog-350x267.png)

* "Edit object" screens, such as Edit Task and Edit Issue

  ![](assets/edit-task-screen-350x237.png)

* Summary ![](assets/summary-panel-icon.png) panel for lists of tasks and issues

  ![](assets/summary-area-350x276.png)

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Changes to the layout templates affect the order and availability of fields in the Summary panel only for the tasks and issues that are assigned to the logged-in user.

## Customize what users see in the Details view

1. Begin working on a layout template, as described in [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).
1. Click the down arrow ![](assets/dropdown-arrow-12x12.png) under **Customize what users see**, then click **Project, Task**, **Issue**, **Program**, or **Portfolio.****, or Billing Record**

1. In the **Details** section, do any of the following to customize what users see in the Details view:

   * Drag any section headers ![](assets/move-icon---dots.png) to change their order.
   * Enable or disable options under **Overview** and **Custom Forms** to show or hide them.

     If you hide all fields in one of these sections, the entire section is hidden.

     All of the fields are enabled by default.

1. Continue customizing the layout template.

   Or

   If you are finished customizing, click **Save**.
