# Customize pinned pages using a layout template

In a layout template, you can pin the pages that you want users to always have available at the top of Adobe Workfront. These can be either pages accessed via the Main Menu ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) or dashboards.

Any pins that your users have added on their own are displayed to the right of the pins you add in the layout template.

For more information about pinning pages, see [Pin pages to customize your workspace](../../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/pin-pages.md).

For more information about layout templates, see [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a group's layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).

After configuring a layout template, you must assign it to users for changes you made to be visible to others. For information about assigning a layout template to users, see [Assign users to a layout template](../use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md).
