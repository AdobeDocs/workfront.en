# Customize the landing page using a layout template

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use a layout template to specify the area you want users to see each time they log in to Workfront.

Users can open one of the following: 

* A designated Workfront area
* A custom dashboard. 

For information about creating layout templates, see [Create and manage layout templates](../use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md). 

For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a group's layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).

After configuring a layout template, you must assign it to users for changes you made to be visible to others. For information about assigning a layout template to users, see [Assign users to a layout template](../use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When Requests is set as the landing page, Contributor or Requestor users assigned to the layout template see the Home page as the landing page instead. Is it recommended to choose a landing page other than Requests for layout templates intended for Contributor or Requestor users.
