# Testing a new layout template

It's important to test the newly or layout template before assigning it to users.

For more information about layout templates, see [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a group's layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).

## Test a new layout template

You can test your layout template in either of the following ways:

* Assign the template to your own user account and verify that it meets all requirements. For instructions, see [Assign a layout template to users](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md#assign).
* Log in as a user who is assigned to the layout template. For instructions, see [Log in as another user](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/log-in-as-another-user.md).

After you have tested your layout template and you are satisfied that it will work well for your users, continue with [Grant administrative access for a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/grant-admin-access-layout-template.md).

For more information about layout templates, see [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).
