# Brand Adobe Workfront using a layout template

As an Adobe Workfront administrator or a group administrator, you can use a layout template to customize the logos in the top navigation area and on the Main Menu for certain groups, teams, job roles, and users. This is especially useful for groups in a large organization that have their own branding.

For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a groupâ€™s layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>A Workfront administrator can make the same branding customizations for the entire organization at the system level, as explained in [Brand your Adobe Workfront instance](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/brand-workfront/brand-your-workfront-instance.md). But branding in a layout template overrides system-level branding.

## Access requirements
