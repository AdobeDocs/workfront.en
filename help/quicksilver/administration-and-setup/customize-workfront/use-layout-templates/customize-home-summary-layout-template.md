# Customize Home and Summary using a layout template

You can use a Layout Template to configure what users see when they click a task or issue in Home and in the Summary. Each configuration you make using the steps below affects the Home area and the Summary panel in the same way. These customizations don't apply to the Document Summary panel.

You can configure:

* What fields display for a task or issue in the Details area, and in what order
* Whether updates, logged time, attached documents, and timestamps display for a selected task or issue

You can also customize the fields that users see in the Home area when users click a project approval, document approval, or document version approval that is assigned to them.

For information about the Home area, see [Use the Home area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-the-home-area.md).For information about the Summary panel, see Summary overview in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a groupâ€™s layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).

      <td role="rowheader">Tasks</td> 
      <td> <p>In Home, your configuration for this setting affects the area to the right of a task when a user clicks the task. And, in a list of tasks, it affects the Summary panel that displays on the right side of the page when a user selects a task, then clicks the Open Summary icon <img src="assets/summary-panel-icon.png">.</p> <p>For example, you can determine which fields users see in the Details area when users select tasks in Home:</p> <p> <img src="assets/home-details-adobe-branding-350x192.jpg" style="width: 350;height: 192;"> </p> <p>And when they select tasks in the Summary:</p> <p> <img src="assets/summary-details-350x219.jpg" style="width: 350;height: 219;"> </p> </td>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Show updates for work</td> 
      <td>Displays any updates made on a selected task or issue in Home or Summary. This includes both system updates and updates made by a user.

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">View documents associated with work</td> 
      <td>Displays a Documents area in Home and Summary when a task or issue is selected, listing any documents attached to the task or issue. Users can click documents to view them in a preview window.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Hide timestamp</td> 
      <td>Hides timestamps for the following date fields in Home and Summary:
       <ul>
        <li>Planned Completion Date</li>
        <li>Commit Date</li>
        <li><p>Submitted Date</p></li>
       </ul><p>Note:  When this option is enabled, work items that become past due are moved to the Late grouping in the Home Work List based on date only, not time.</p></td>
