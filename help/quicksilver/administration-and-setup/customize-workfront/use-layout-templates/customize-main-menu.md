# Customize the Main Menu using a layout template

As an Adobe Workfront administrator or a group administrator, you can use a layout template to configure the options users see when they open the Main Menu in Workfront:

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Main Menu options that users see depend on their license type and what settings are configured in their access level. Some users who will use this layout template may not see all the options you choose here. For more information see [How access levels and permissions work together](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/how-access-levels-permissions-work-together.md) and [Configurable access to functionality for each object type](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/configurable-functionality-in-each-access-level-by-object-type.md).

For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a group's layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>To perform these steps at the system level, you need the System Administrator access level.
To perform them for a group, you must be a manager of that group.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
