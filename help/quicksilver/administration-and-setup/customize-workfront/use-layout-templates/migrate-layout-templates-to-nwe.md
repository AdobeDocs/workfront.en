## Migrate your layout templates from Workfront Classic to the new Adobe Workfront experience

1. In Workfront Classic, click **Setup** near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.
1. Click **Interface** > **Layout Templates**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >In the list that displays, group administrators can see only the layout templates that are managed by the groups that they administer.

1. Select the layout templates that you want to migrate, then click **Migrate**.
1. If you are sure you want to migrate them, click **Yes, migrate** in the message box that displays.

   If the layout templates don't already exist in the new Adobe Workfront experience, they will be added there.

   If they do already exist in the new Adobe Workfront experience, these layout templates will replace them. 

1. (Optional) Switch to the new Workfront experience to make sure the layout templates you migrated from Workfront Classic are available there.
