# Position custom fields and widgets in a custom form with the legacy form builder

You can reposition custom fields and widgets in a custom form.

For information about custom fields and widgets in custom forms, see [Add a custom field to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md) and [Add or edit an asset widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-widget-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront plan*</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td>Plan</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access level configurations you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Position custom fields and widgets in a custom form

1. Begin creating or editing a custom form, as described in [Create or edit a custom form with the legacy form builder](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).
1. Add custom fields and widgets to the form, as described in [Add a custom field to a custom form with the legacy form builder](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md) and [Add or edit an asset widget in a custom form with the legacy form builder](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-widget-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).

1. (Optional) To position custom fields and widgets on the same row, drag one next to the other until a line appears between them.

Courtney, this is a story that got postponed after I did the work. Slated for some time in 22.4 (https://hub.workfront.adobe.com/task/6220d425000140d7f7d3ea68cc9529c8/documents)
   You can drag multiple items. Press the following keys while you select the items, then drag the items together to the new row:
   * Mac: Command+Shift [Courtney, double-check these commands]
   * Windows: Ctrl+Shift

   When you drop the custom field or widget, a gray box displays around the two items to indicate that they share a row.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* You can use the **Preview** button in the lower-right corner to get an idea of how the custom fields and widgets will display in the form.
   >* Descriptive Text fields cannot share a row. 
   >* Custom fields and widgets may not always display the same way in the form, depending on how much screen space is available when a user is viewing it. For example, the third field in a row of fields may wrap to the next row of fields if horizontal space is limited.

1. (Optional)To position a custom field or widget above or below another one, drag it above or below until a horizontal blue line appears between the items.
1. Click **Apply**.
