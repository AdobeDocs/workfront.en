## Position fields

<!--
and widgets
-->

in a custom form

1. Begin creating or editing a custom form, as described in [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).
1. Add custom fields

   <!--
   and widgets
   -->

   to the form, as described in [Add a custom field to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md) and [Add or edit an image widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-image-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).

1. (Optional) To position fields on the same row, drag one field

   <!--
   or widget
   -->

   next to the other until a line appears between them.

   When you drop the field, a gray box displays around the two items to indicate that they share a row. You can use the **Preview** button in the lower-right corner to see how they will appear on the custom form.

1. (Optional)To position a field

   <!--
   or widget
   -->

   above or below another one, drag it above or below until a horizontal blue line appears between the items.
