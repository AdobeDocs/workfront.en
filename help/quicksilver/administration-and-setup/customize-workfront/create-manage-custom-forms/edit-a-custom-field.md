# Add or edit a custom field, section break, or widget

You can add a new custom field or widget directly from the Fields area in Workfront, without opening a custom form to create the field.

You can also edit the properties of a custom field, section break, or widget that is used in custom forms. These include the item's label, name, instructions, and so on.

For information about custom fields and widgets in custom forms, see [Design a form with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).

## Access requirements
