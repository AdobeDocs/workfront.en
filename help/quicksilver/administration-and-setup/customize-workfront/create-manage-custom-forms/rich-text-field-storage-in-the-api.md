# Rich text field storage in the API

If an object such as a project, issue, or task contains rich text, it is stored and accessible as a parameter value through the Workfront API.

Requesting text information from a project object that contains rich text can be done using the field **parameterValues**.

**Example:** A simple HTTP request could resemble the following:
`https://your-company.workfront.com/attask/api/v11.0/project?ID=your-project-ID&fields=parameterValues:*` If this example project contained a custom form with 3 custom fields: calc field, paragraph text, and rich 1. Then the above request would return a response that resembles the following, where the field "rich 1" is a rich text parameter field and the text value is “**Hello** *World!*”:

```
{
	Data: {
		ID: “xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx”,
		name: “new project with rich text”,
		objCode: “PROJ”,
		- parameterValues: {
			DE:rich 1: “{
				"blocks":[
				{
					"key":"7eibh",
					"text":"Hello Word!",
					"type":"unstyled",
					"depth":0,
					"inlineStyleRanges":[
					{
						"offset":0,
						"length":6,
						"style":"BOLD"
					},
					{
						"offset":6,
						"length":5,
						"style":"ITALIC"
					}
					],
					"entityRanges":[
					],
				"data":{
				}
				}
				],
			"entityMap":{
			}
		}”,
		DE: paragraph text: “here is some paragraph text”,
		DE: calc field: “here is a calc field entry”,
		}
	}
}
```

For a more in depth look at how rich text information is stored and can be retrieved through the Adobe Workfront API, see [Rich text fields in the Adobe Workfront API](../../../wf-api/general/rich-text-field-api.md).
