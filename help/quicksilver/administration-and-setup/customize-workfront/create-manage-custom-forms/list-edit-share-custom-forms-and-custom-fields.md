# List and edit custom forms, fields, and section breaks

When you view a list of the custom forms, custom fields, or section breaks in the system, options in the toolbar let you edit them, limit who they are shared with, copy them, and delete them. You can also view other information in the columns that display, such as which object types each custom form is associated with.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col>

 <tbody> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront plan*</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr>
