# Delete a custom form

You can delete a custom form from the system.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Deleting a custom form also deletes all custom data on the objects associated with the form. The deleted data cannot be recovered. Consider deactivating a custom form insteadâ€”when deactivate a custom form you no longer use, you retain all of the associated historical data. For more information, see [Re-activate or deactivate a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/manage-a-form/activate-deactivate-form.md)

## Access requirements
