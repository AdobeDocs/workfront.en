title: Add calculated data to a custom form
description: In a custom form, you can build a calculated custom field that generates calculations. To do this, you create a statement that uses data expressions and the names of existing fields, which can be custom fields, calculated custom data fields, and built-in Workfront fields. This statement calculates the data you enter and displays the result in the new calculated custom field.

# Add calculated data to a custom form

In a custom form, you can add a calculated custom field that generates new data using data that already exists in your system. The result is generated when the custom form is attached to an object. 

A calculated custom field can contain:

* A simple reference to a single built-in field.

  >[!INFO]
  >
  > **Example:** To calculate the revenue generated by projects and tasks, you could create a calculated custom field  that contains the built-in  field Actual Revenue. When someone attaches the custom form to a project or task, the revenue for the project or task displays in the field.

* An expression that references one or more fields. These can be custom fields, other calculated custom fields, and built-in  fields.

  >[!INFO]
  >
  >**Example:** To calculate the profit generated by projects and tasks, you could create a calculated custom field called Profit containing a mathematical expression that subtracts cost from revenue.
  >
  >To do this, you could use the mathematical expression SUB (subtract) with the built-in Workfront fields Actual Cost and Actual Revenue.
  >
  >In the steps below, you can see how this example can be carried out.

For information about creating custom forms for your organization and understanding the type of fields you can associate with them, see [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

## Add a calculated field to a custom form {#add-a-calculated-field-to-a-custom-form}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Before you create a new calculated custom field, identify the existing fields that you want to include so that you are sure that the data necessary for the calculation is present in Workfront.

1. Begin creating or editing a custom form, as described in [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).  

1. On the **Add a Field** tab, click **Calculated**.

   In the display area on the right, the field displays *12345*. This is merely an indicator to remind you that the field is a calculated custom field while you are creating or editing the custom form. When the form is attached to an object and users are filling it out, they see the result of the calculation in the field, never the *12345* indicator.

1. Specify the following information for the calculated field:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Label</td> 
      <td>Type a label for the field. This is what users will see when they use the custom form. The field <b>Name</b>, which fills in automatically, is referenced by Workfront in reports.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader" id="instructions"><a name="Instructions"></a>Instructions</td> 
      <td> By default, the formula you create for the field is stored here. You can add text to provide additional information about the field and the formula in it. This can be useful in two ways: 
       <ul> 
        <li> <p>As a reminder of what the formula is and how it works. This is especially helpful if you plan to use this calculated custom field on multiple forms.</p> </li> 
        <li> <p>As a tooltip users can see when they hover over the field. You add any text here that you want them to see in the tooltip.</p> <p>If you don't want them to see the formula in the tooltip, which might be confusing for them, you can hide it. For instructions, see the table row "Display formula in instructions" in the section <a href="#build-the-calculation-for-your-calculated-custom-field" class="MCXref xref">Build the calculation for your calculated custom field</a> in this article.</p> </li> 
       </ul> <p>For information about using the same calculated custom field on a new form, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/use-existing-calc-field-new-custom-form.md#using-an-existing-calculated-custom-field-on-a-new-form" class="MCXref xref">Reuse an existing calculated custom field in a custom form</a>.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Format</td> 
      <td> <p>The format in which you want the results of the field are stored and displayed.</p> <p>If the field will be used in mathematical calculations, always use a <strong>Number</strong> or a <strong>Currency</strong> format. When you select Number or Currency, the system automatically truncates numbers that start with 0.</p> 
      <p>Important: Before you choose a format, consider the correct format for the new field. The format field cannot be edited after the custom form is saved. And selecting the wrong format could impact future calculations and aggregate values in report and list groupings.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

## Build the calculation for your calculated custom field {#build-the-calculation-for-your-calculated-custom-field}

1. Start creating the calculated custom field, as explained in the section [Add a calculated field to a custom form](#add-a-calculated-field-to-a-custom-form) in this article.

1. Click **Maximize** to open the **Calculation Editor** and build your calculation.

   >[!INFO]
   >
   >**Example:** Using the example in the introduction to this article, you could create a calculated custom field called Profit in a custom form for projects and tasks. This field could contain a calculation that displays the difference between Actual Revenue and Actual Cost:
   >
   >```
   >SUB({actualRevenue},{actualCost})
   >```
   >
   >In this example, `SUB` is the expression, and the referenced fields are `actualRevenue` and `actualCost.`

   A calculation usually starts with an expression, followed by parentheses containing the fields you want to reference when the custom form is attached to an object. For information about the expressions that are available, see [Calculated data expressions](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-data-expressions.md).

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Each field must use the syntax explained in the section in the section [Syntax required in calculated custom fields](#syntax-required-in-calculated-custom-fields) in this article. Surround each field with curly brackets. When you start typing the name of a field, the system makes suggestions and you can select one to insert it into your calculation.

1. Click in the large text box, then click **Expressions** and **Fields** that are available to add them to your calculation.

   You can also start typing an expression or field in the large text box, then select it when it displays. Each item displays with an "F" for field or an "E" for expression.

   If you type an opening parenthesis, the closing parenthesis is added automatically.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can do any of the following to get help with your calculation:
   > 
   >* Hover over an expression in your calculation to see a description, an example showing how it can be used, and a "Learn More" link to more information in the article [Calculated data expressions](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-data-expressions.md).
   >* Use the color coding to identify the components you have added. Expressions display in blue and fields display in green:

1. Click **Minimize** when you are finished creating the calculation for the calculated custom field.

    >[!NOTE] 
    >
    >In the display area on the right, the field displays *12345.* This is merely an indicator to remind you that the field is a calculated custom field while you are creating or editing the custom form. When the form is attached to an object and users are filling it out, they see the result of the calculation in the field, never the *12345* indicator.

1. (Optional) Use any of the following options to further configure your calculated custom field:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Add Logic</td> 
      <td>You can add Display Logic to determine whether the calculated field displays, based on at least one choice that a user makes in a preceding multiple choice field (Dropdown, Checkboxes, or Radio Buttons) when filling out the form.

     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Update previous calculations</td> 
      <td>When you are editing an existing calculated custom field, you can select this option to trigger an update in the calculation when you save the custom form. This happens only once when you save the custom form. The option returns to its disabled state after you do so.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> 
      <td role="rowheader"><a name="Display_formula_in_instructions"></a>Display formula in instructions</td> 
      <td>Leave this option enabled if you want the users who fill out the custom form to see the field's formula when they hover over the field. For more information, see the information about <a href="#instructions" class="MCXref xref">Instructions</a> earlier in this table.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **Done** when all changes are complete on the calculated custom field.
   
   Or, click **Apply** to apply your changes to the form so far if you want to continue adding custom fields to the form.
   
   Or, click **Save + Close** when all changes are complete on the custom form.
1. To verify that your calculated custom field works correctly, attach the custom form to an object, then review the result in the calculated custom field.

   For instructions on attaching a custom form, see [Add a custom form to an object](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/add-a-custom-form-to-an-object.md).
   
   If you want to continue building your custom form in other ways, you can continue on to one of the following articles:

   * [Preview and complete a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/preview-and-complete-a-custom-form.md)

  ## Syntax required in calculated custom fields
  Each field must use the syntax explained below, with curly brackets around each field name. When you start typing the name of a field, the system makes suggestions and you can select one  to insert it into your calculation. If you enter data in a calculation incorrectly, a warning messages alerts you. You cannot save the form unless you edit your calculation to contain valid fields and a valid calculated expression.

  >[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, the system makes suggestions only when you starting typing the name of a field you want to reference  on an object that the custom form will be attached to, not on the object's parent.

### Surround field names with curly brackets  
* If you want the calculation to reference a built-in field, the name of the field must be surrounded by curly brackets.

      >[!INFO]
      >
      >**Example:** `{actualRevenue}`

* If you want the calculation to reference a custom field, the name of the field must be surrounded by curly brackets, and preceded by `DE:` within the brackets.

  >[!INFO]
  >
  >**Example:**
  >```
  >{DE:profit}

    The system lists all of the custom fields you can choose from when you type when you type `DE:`.

* If you want the calculation to reference a field that will pull data from  the parent object when the custom form is attached to an object, you must precede the field name with the object type of the parent object, also in curly brackets.

  For instance, if the custom form is configured to work with tasks, and you want the field to calculate the actual revenue of the parent object when the form is attached to a task, you need to indicate Project as the object type of the field, as in the first example shown below.

    >[!INFO]
    >
    >**Example:**
    >
    >```{project}.{actualRevenue}```
    >
    >Or, if it's a custom field:
    >
    >```{project}.{DE:profit}```

    If you're not sure what the object type of the parent object will be because the custom for is configured for multiple object types, you can use the wildcard filter variable `$$OBJCODE` to allow the calculation to work for each of the possible types. For more information, see [Calculated custom fields in multi-object custom forms](#calculated-custom-fields-in-multi-object-custom-forms) in this article.

### Separate items with periods
When you reference a related object in a calculated custom field, you must separate object names and attributes with periods.

  >[!INFO]
  >
  >**Example:**
  >
  >In a task-type custom form, to display the name of the Portfolio Owner in a calculated custom field, you would type the following:
  >```
  >{project}.{porfolio}.{owner}
  >```
  >This would determine the following: From the object of the custom form (a task), you can access the next object related to the task (a project). From there, you can access the next related object to the project (a portfolio), then the next related object to the portfolio (the owner).

### Name syntax for referencing a custom field
When you reference another custom field in a calculated custom field, you need to enter the name of the field appears as it displays in the Workfront user interface.

  >[!INFO]
  >
  >**Example:**
  >
  >To reference the selected option in a custom field labeled Executive sponsor, you would enter the following
  >
  >```
  >{DE:Executive sponsor}
  >```

## Considerations for building calculated custom fields

Consider the following when building a calculated custom field in a custom form:

* You can use both built-in Workfront fields and custom fields that you already created.
* You can refer to objects that are related to other objects in a calculation. For information about how objects connect to one another, see the section [Interdependency and hierarchy of objects](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md#understanding-interdependency-and-hierarchy-of-objects) in the article [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md). 

## Calculated custom fields in multi-object custom forms {#calculated-custom-fields-in-multi-object-custom-forms}

In a multi-object custom form, the selected object types must be compatible with all fields referenced in the form's calculated custom fields. If there is an incompatibility, a message alerts you to make adjustments.

 >[!INFO]
  >
  >**Example:**
  >
  >In a custom form configured to work with the Task object type, you create a calculated custom field named In Charge. You configure it to reference the built-in field so that it can show the name of the primary assignee in charge whenever the form is attached to a task:
  >```
  >Assigned To: Name{assignedTo}.{name}
  >```
  >Later, you add the Project object type to the custom form. A warning message tells you that the Project object type is incompatible with the calculated custom field. 

When this occurs, you can do one of the following:

* Remove one of the two incompatible items from the custom form—either the object type or the referenced field.
* Keep both items and use the wildcard filter variable `$$OBJCODE` as a condition in an IF expression to create two different versions of the In Charge field. This allows the field to function successfully, no matter which type of object the form is attached to. 

  >[!INFO]
  >
  >**Example:** Though there is no Assigned To: Name field in projects, there is a built-in Owner field (which fills in automatically with the name of the person who created the project, unless someone manually changes this).
  >
  >So, in your custom In Charge field, you could use `$$OBJCODE`as shown below to reference the Owner field when the custom form is attached to a project, and the Assigned To: Name field when the form is attached to a task:
  >```
  >IF($$OBJCODE="PROJ",{owner}.{name},{assignedTo}.{name})
  >```

  For more information about variables like `$$OBJCODE,` see [Wildcard filter variables](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/understand-wildcard-filter-variables.md).

## Automatic updates of calculated custom fields

Calculated custom fields on an object recalculate automatically when the following things happen:

* Something on the object changes, such as a daily timeline calculation.
* Someone edits another field that is referenced by a calculated custom field on the object.
* The calculated expression is empty and the field contains a value—this sets the value to null.
