# Add a section break to a custom form with the legacy form builder

You can group the custom fields and widgets in a custom form into sections with headings. This is useful for presenting an organized experience to users who will fill out the form. Also, if you need to limit access to certain custom fields and widgets to certain users, you can place them in a section and then grant access to the section to only those users.

For example, if you need to track sensitive information that only system administrators should be able to view or edit, you can create a section break with Admin Only permissions and place the sensitive fields in that section.

The access settings you select for a section are directly tied to the permissions users have on the Workfront object where the custom form is attached. You can hide or show a section based on whether the user has access to view, contribute to, or manage that object. Or you can set a section to Admin Only so that only users with a system administrator access level can access it.

For information about permissions on objects, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

For information about custom fields and widgets in custom forms, see [Add a custom field to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md) and [Add or edit an asset widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-widget-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).

<!--

>Section breaks that you add to custom forms are saved in your system for re-use. For information about listing them, see [List and edit custom forms and widgets added to custom forms](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/list-edit-share-custom-forms-and-custom-fields.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront plan</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td>
   <p>New: Standard</p>
   <p>Current: Plan</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>Administrative access to custom forms</p></td> 
  </tr>  
 </tbody> 
</table>

For more detail about the information in this table, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md).

## Create and configure access for a section in a custom form

1. Begin creating or editing a custom form, as described in [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).
1. Add custom fields and widgets to the form, as described in [Add a custom field to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md) and [Add or edit an asset widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-widget-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).

1. While still creating or editing the custom form, on the **Add a field** tab, click **Section Break**.

1. On the **Field Settings** tab, configure the options you want for the section:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Label</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) Type a descriptive label to display above the section. You can change the label at any time.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Avoid using special characters in this label. They don't display correctly in reports.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Description</td> 
      <td>Type text if you want to explain to users what the section is for. This displays below the section's label on the custom form.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><p>Add Logic</p></td> 
      <td><p>Use display logic to specify whether the section should display on the form, based on selections users make in multi-choice custom fields when they fill out the form.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If all of the individual fields under a section break have display logic applied to them and they are all hidden as a result of the logic, the entire section will be hidden on the custom form. This will happen even if display logic is not applied to the section break.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/display-or-skip-logic-custom-form.md" class="MCXref xref">Add display logic and skip logic to a custom form</a>.</p></td>

## How multiple object types can affect section break permissions {#how-multiple-object-types-can-affect-section-break-permissions-in-a-custom-form}

The Limited Edit permission for custom form section breaks is available for only the Project, Task, Issue, and User object types.

In a custom form with a section break configured with the Limited Edit permission, if you add one of the other object types to the form (Portfolio, Program, Document, Company, Billing Record, Iteration, Expense, or Group), you will be prompted to switch to the Edit permission, which is compatible with both that object type and the existing object types on the form. 

>[!INFO]
>
>**Example:** In a custom form associated with the Project object type, a section break is configured with the Limited Edit permission.
>
>You add the Portfolio object type to the form, which means that the Limited Edit permission option is no longer available for the section break in the form.
>
>An on-screen message prompts you to switch to the Edit permission, which is the most similar option to Limited Edit, and compatible with both the Project object type and the Portfolio object type.
