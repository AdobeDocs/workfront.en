# Access for a shared custom field you want to use

When someone shares a custom field with View or Manage access, they can configure several other settings to further define that access. If you are a recipient of the field, those settings impact what you can do with the field. You might see the following when you view the field.

For more information about how users configure sharing settings when sharing a custom form, see [Configure sharing for custom fields and widgets](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/configure-sharing-for-a-custom-field.md).
