## Delete object types on a custom form

You can delete object types from an existing custom form.

A custom form must have at least one object type.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If people have already attached the custom form to objects of the type you want to delete and added data to it, that data is permanently deleted when you delete that object type on the form. It might include historical information that users will need later.
>
>In general, we recommend minimizing the number of times you edit a custom form that is already in use. There is no notification system to alert people who use the custom form about your changes.
