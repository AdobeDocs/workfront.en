# Add a custom field to a custom form with the legacy form builder

<!-- Audited: 02/2024 -->

{{form-designer-default}}

When you are working on a custom form, you can create a new custom field and add it to a custom form.

You can also add a custom field that was already added to another custom form. For instructions, see [Reuse a custom field or widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/reuse-an-existing-field.md).

For information about adding an asset widget to a custom form, which is a process similar to adding a custom field, see [Add or edit an asset widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-widget-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>In a custom form containing a lot of custom fields or a lot of multi-select options in custom fields, users might experience a slower performance when adding or changing values in those fields. For example, a form containing 100 custom fields, or multi-select custom fields with more than 200 options, might be slower when users interact with it.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront plan</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td>
   <p>New: Standard</p>
   <p>or</p>
   <p>Current: Plan</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td>Administrative access to custom forms </td> 
  </tr>  
 </tbody> 
</table>

For more detail about the information in this table, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md).

## Add a custom field to a custom form {#add-custom-field-to-custom-form}

1. Begin creating or editing a custom form, as described in [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).
1. Select the **Add a field** tab.

   ![Add a field tab](assets/add-a-field.jpg)

1. With **New Field** ![New Field icon](assets/new-field.jpg) selected, select one of these field types:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Single Line Text Field</td> 
      <td>Allows users to type a single line of text in the field.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Paragraph Text Field</td> 
      <td>Allows users to type multiple lines of text in the field.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
      <td role="rowheader">Text Field with Formatting</td> 
      <td>Allows users to type multiple lines of text in the field and format the text with bold, italics, underline, bullets, numbering, hyperlinks, and block quotes. This is available in Home, the Updates area, lists, and the Details area for Workfront objects. A character limit of 15,000 allows for plenty of text and formatting.</p> <p>This custom field type is not supported in filters on lists and reports.</p> <p>For information about accessing this field through the API, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/rich-text-field-storage-in-the-api.md" class="MCXref xref">Rich text field storage in the API</a>.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>:  Text fields with formatting are not available for Workfront mobile apps. </p> </td>

      <td role="rowheader">Typeahead </td> 
      <td>Allows users to type the name of an object that exists in Workfront. A list of suggestions appears when the user starts typing.

      </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr>

      <td>Allows you to define an expression and display the result on the custom form.

      <td>Allows you to include instructions and link to pages outside Workfront.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Section Break</td> 
      <td>A section break is actually not a field. You can use a section break to organize your custom fields and widgets into sections and, if necessary, configure different viewing and editing permissions for each section. For information about adding and configuring section breaks, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-section-break-to-a-custom-form.md" class="MCXref xref">Add a section break to a custom form</a>.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Fields that allow multiple selections, such as the Checkbox and Dropdown, are difficult to chart and group in reports. To allow easier charting and grouping in reports, you can create separate fields for each choice (for example, a single-line text field).

1. On the **Field Settings** tab, configure the options that are available for the type of custom field you are adding:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Label</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) Type a descriptive label to display above the custom field. You can change the label at any time.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Avoid using special characters in this label. They don't display correctly in reports.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) This name is how the system identifies the custom field when you add it to various areas throughout Workfront, such as reports, Home, and API interactions.</p> <p>When you are configuring the custom field for the first time and you type the label, the Name field populates automatically to match it. But the Label and Name fields are not synchronizedâ€”this gives you the freedom to change the label that your users see without having to change the name that the system sees.</p> 
      <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>:   
      <ul> 
      <li>Though it's possible to do so, we recommend that you do not change this name after you or other users start using the custom form in Workfront. If you do, the system will no longer recognize the custom field where it might now be referenced in other areas of Workfront. <p>For example, if you add the custom field to a report and later change its name, Workfront doesn't recognize it in the report and it will stop functioning correctly there unless you re-add it to the report using the new name.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>We recommend that you do not type a name that is already used for built-in Workfront fields.</p> </li>
      <li><p>We recommend that you do not use the period/dot character in the custom field name, to prevent errors when using the field in different areas of Workfront.</p></li>
      </ul> <p>Each custom field name must be unique in your organization's Workfront instance. This way, you can reuse one that was already created for another custom form. For more information, see <a href="#add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form">Add a custom field to a custom form</a> in this article.</p> </td>
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Instructions</td> 
      <td> <p>Type any additional information about the custom field. When users fill out the custom form, they can hover over the question mark icon to view a tool tip containing the information you type here.</p> 
      <p> <img src="assets/custom-field-tooltip.png"> </p>
      </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Format</td> 
      <td> <p>Select the type of data that will be captured in the custom field. You can change the format selection after saving the form, but the new format must support the value entered.</p> 
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you save a numeric value for a field with Text format on at least one object and later change the format to Number or Currency, you will not encounter an error. </p>
      <p>However, if you save an alphanumeric value in a field with Text format on at least one object and then try to change the format to Number or Currency, you will encounter an error because the saved alphanumeric value is not compatible with the Number or Currency formats. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The character limit for Number fields is 16. You can also use a Text field to enter numbers and avoid the limit.</p>

     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. (Conditional) To change the display type of a field on the custom form, click the **Display Type** drop-down menu, then click the type you want.

   You can switch between the following field display types:

   * **Selection-type fields**: Checkboxes, Dropdown, Radio Buttons.
   * **Text-type fields**: Single Line Text Field, Paragraph Text Field. (You can't switch a Text Field with Formatting to a different display type. However, you can remove it and add another type of field.)

   For example, if you have created a Checkboxes field, you can change it to a Dropdown field or a Radio Buttons field. Or, if you have created a Single Line Text Field, you can change it to a Paragraph Text field.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Consider the following when you want to change a field's display type from a checkbox field or a multi-select dropdown field (a dropdown allowing more than one option to be selected) to a single-select field type:
   >
   >* If you change to Radio Buttons, Workfront retains any multi-select values that a user may have entered in the field until the user changes and saves data in any part of the form. At this point, any values that were selected using the multi-select-type field are replaced by the selected Radio Button value.
   >* If you change to a single-select Dropdown, Workfront retains any multi-select values that a user may have entered in the field until the user changes and saves the values in the field. At this point, any values that were selected using the multi-select-type field are replaced by the selected Dropdown value.

1. (Optional) Repeat steps 3-5 to add more custom fields.

   Or

   Add fields that have already been created for your organization, as explained in [Reuse a custom field or widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/reuse-an-existing-field.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can add up to 500 fields and widgets on a single custom form. However, performance degradation can occur when more than 100 exist on a form, depending on its complexity. Examples of complex forms include forms with cascading parameters, calculated custom data fields, and multiple value options in a single field.

1. Click **Apply**.
