## Custom fields and widgets

Workfront provides many built-in fields for each object type. In a custom form, you can create additional fields that prompt users for information that is unique to their workflows. These custom fields are the building blocks of a custom form.

You can add the following types of custom fields to a custom form in Workfront:

* Single line text field
* Paragraph text field
* Text field with formatting 
* Dropdown
* Calculated
* Date
* Checkboxes
* Radio buttons
* Descriptive text

For more information, see [Add a custom field to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md).

You can also add image and ```video``` widgets to a custom form. This is useful when you need to include content such as branding images or visual instructions.
