You can build a custom form that users can attach to a Workfront object. Users who work on the object can fill out the custom form to supply information about the object.

For example, a user can attach the following custom form to a project so that users on the project can request marketing content for the project:

## Custom fields and widgets

Workfront provides many built-in fields for each object type. In a custom form, you can create additional fields that prompt users for information that is unique to their workflows. These custom fields are the building blocks of a custom form.

You can add the following types of custom fields to a custom form in Workfront:

* Single line text field
* Paragraph text field
* Text field with formatting 
* Dropdown
* Calculated
* Date
* Checkboxes
* Radio buttons
* Descriptive text

For more information, see [Add a custom field to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md).

You can also add visual asset widgets to a custom form. This is useful when you need to include content such as branding images or visual instructions. For more information, see [Add or edit an asset widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-widget-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).

For instructions on creating a custom form, see [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

Users can attach custom forms to the following object types:

* Project (including Business Cases)
* Task
* Issue
* Company

* User
* Program
* Portfolio
* Expense
