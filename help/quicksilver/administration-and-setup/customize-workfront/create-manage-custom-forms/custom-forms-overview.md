# Custom forms overview

You can build a custom form that users can attach to a Workfront object. Users who work on the object can fill out the custom form to supply information about the object.

For example, a user can attach the following custom form to a project so that users on the project can request marketing content for the project:

## Custom fields and widgets

Workfront provides many built-in fields for each object type. In a custom form, you can create additional fields that prompt users for information that is unique to their workflows. These custom fields are the building blocks of a custom form.

You can add the following types of custom fields to a custom form in Workfront:

* Single line text field
* Paragraph text field
* Text field with formatting 
* Dropdown
* Calculated
* Date
* Checkboxes
* Radio buttons
* Descriptive text

## How to create a custom form

There are two options to create a custom form in [!DNL Workfront]. You can use the Legacy custom form builder or the new form designer:

* [Legacy custom form builder](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/use-the-custom-form-builder.md)
* [Form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/form-designer-toc.md)

## Objects where users can attach a custom form

Users can attach custom forms to the following object types:

* Project (including Business Cases)
* Task
* Issue
* Company
* Document
* User
* Program
* Portfolio
* Expense
* Group

For instructions, see [Add a custom form to an object](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/add-a-custom-form-to-an-object.md).

Users who create a custom form can configure it to work with more than one object type.
