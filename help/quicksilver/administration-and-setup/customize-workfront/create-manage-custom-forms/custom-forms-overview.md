# Custom forms overview

You can build a custom form that users can attach to an Adobe Workfront object. Users who work on the object can fill out the custom form to supply information about the object.

For example, you can attach a custom form called "Marketing Content Research" to attach to a project so that users on the project can request marketing content for the project:

## How to create a custom form

There are two options to create a custom form in [!DNL Workfront]. You can use the Legacy custom form builder or the new form designer:

* [Legacy custom form builder](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/use-the-custom-form-builder.md)
* [Form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/form-designer-toc.md)

## Custom fields and widgets

Workfront provides many built-in fields for each object type. 

In a custom form, you can create additional fields that prompt users for information that is unique to their workflows. These custom fields are the building blocks of a custom form.

You can add the following types of custom fields to a custom form in Workfront:

* Single Line Text Field, or Single line text in the form designer
* Paragraph Text Field, or Paragraph text in the form designer
* Text Field with Formatting, or Text with formatting in the form designer
* Dropdown
* External Lookup - only available in the form designer
* Typeahead
* Calculated
* Date, or Date Field in the form designer
* Checkboxes
* Radio Buttons
* Descriptive Text
* Section Break
* Adobe XD

Users can attach custom forms to the following object types:

* Project (including Business Cases)
* Task
* Issue (including Request Queue)
* Company
* Document
* User
* Program
* Portfolio
* Expense
