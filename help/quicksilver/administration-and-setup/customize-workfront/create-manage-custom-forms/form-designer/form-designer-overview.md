# Form designer overview

{{highlighted-preview-article-level}}

You can use the new form designer to design a custom form that users can attach to a Workfront object. Users who work on the object can fill out the custom form to supply information about the object.

The new form designer has a new canvas-style workspace that allows you to view the fields, canvas, and field settings all at the same time. It also allows you to drag-and-drop fields within the sections while designing your form. 

<!-- add screenshot when field settings empty state is ready -->

## New funtionality available with the form designer

With the new form designer, we've added the ability to 

* **Copy a field**: You can now copy existing fields by clicking on the Copy icon on the fields directly from the canvas. 

* **Change the size for Descriptive text**: You can now assign small, medium, or large sizes to Descriptive text fields. You can also use them on the same row with other fields. 

* **Use a Default section**: If the form creator has not added a section at the top of the form, a Default section is now visible in the canvas, so that users can adjust the permissions for fields that have no custom section assigned. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Default section is not visible within objects once the form is attached to the object.  

## Functionality coming soon

The folloiwng are not currently available in the form designer but will be added soon:

* Display/Skip logic  

* Filter for typeahead fields 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The existing configurations for logic and typeahead filters will not be affected when you work with the new form designer.

## Functionlity removed from the form designer

We've removed the following functionality from inside form designer. You can still access it in **Setup** > **Custom Forms**.


* Form Settings, Form Sharing, Field Sharing tabs  

    * Form settings are now available at the top of the canvas

    * Form Sharing main tab and Field Sharing subtab

    >[!NOTE]

    >You can control the form and field sharing from Setup > Custom Forms > Forms or Fields tab.
