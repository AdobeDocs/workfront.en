# Design a form from a copy

You can design a new custom form that is based on an existing one. You can attach custom forms to different Workfront objects to capture data about those objects.

## Copy a custom form to create a new one

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. Click **Custom Forms.**
1. Select the custom form that you want to use as the basis for a new custom form, then click ![Copy icon](assets/copy-icon.png).
1. In the **Custom Form Copy** box that appears, type the following information:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Form Name</td> 
      <td>Type a name for the copied form.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"> <p role="rowheader">Form Types </p> </td> 
      <td> <p>In the <b>Form Type</b> box, select the object types that you want the custom form to work with, and click the X next to any types that you want to remove. Types that are already associated with the form are disabled in the list.</p> 
      <p><img src="assets/copy-form-obj-types-040524.png"></p> 
      <p>The form must be associated with at least one object type.</p> 
      </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **Copy**.

   In the original form, if calculated fields reference fields that are incompatible with an object type you add to the new form, a message prompts you to change the calculations in those fields.

   Similarly, if an access option for a section break on the original form isn't compatible with an object type you add to the new one, a message prompts you to adjust the option.

1. Select the form that you just copied, then click ![Edit icon](assets/edit-icon.png).
1. Make any changes to the form, as explained in the following sections of the [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md) article:
