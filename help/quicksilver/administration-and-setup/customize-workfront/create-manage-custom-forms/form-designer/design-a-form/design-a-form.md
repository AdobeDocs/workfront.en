# Design a form with the Form Designer

You can design a custom form with the Form Designer. You can attach custom forms to different Workfront objects to capture data about those objects.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront plan*</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td>
   <p>Current plan: Standard</p>
   <p>or</p>
   <p>Legacy plan: Plan</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Administrative access to custom forms</p> <p>For information about how Workfront administrators grants this access, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-users-admin-access-certain-areas.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant users administrative access to certain areas</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr>  
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access level configurations you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Start designing a custom form

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. Click **Custom Forms** in the left panel.

   <!-- >[!TIP]
    >
    >In the view that appears, you can review all custom forms and custom fields that have been created for your organization. You can also see who created each form and the fields that are associated with it. -->

1. Click **New Custom Form.**
1. Select which object types you'd like to attach the custom form to, then click **Continue**.

   ![](assets/choose-object-type.jpg)

1. In the **Title is required** area, type the custom form title.
1. (Optional) If you want to add more object types to the form so that it can be attached to more objects, click the **Add** icon ![](assets/add-objects-icon.png) after **Object Types**, then select the type you want in the menu that displays. You can repeat this to add as many object types as you want. 
   
   You can also click the X on an object type to delete it from the form. 

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Deleting a custom form also deletes all custom data on the objects associated with the form. The deleted data cannot be recovered. Consider deactivating a custom form instead—when deactivate a custom form you no longer use, you retain all of the associated historical data.
   >
   >For more information, see [Delete object types on a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/delete-object-type-on-a-custom-form.md).

1. Next, you can start adding fields to your custom form. See the following sections:
    * [Reuse an existing field or widget already used in another custom form](#reuse-an-existing-field-or-widget-already-used-in-another-custom-form)
    * [Add text fields](#add-text-fields)
    * [Add calculated fields](#add-calculated-fields)
    * [Add radio buttons, checkbox group, and dropdowns](#add-radio-buttons-checkboxes-and-dropdowns)
    * [Add typeahead and date fields](#add-typeahead-and-date-fields)
    * [Add images, PDFs, and Videos](#add-images-pdfs-and-videos)
    * [Add Adobe XD files](#add-adobe-xd-files)

## Add new or existing fields to your custom form

You can use new or existing fields when designing your custom form. 

## Reuse an existing field or widget already used in another custom form

1. On the top-left side of the screen, click **Field library**.

1. Drag the field or widget here you want it in the custom form.
1. (Optional) Repeat the previous step to add any other fields or widgets.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can add up to 500 fields and widgets on a single custom form. However, performance degradation can occur when more than 100 exist on a form, depending on its complexity. 
   >
   >
   >Examples of complex forms include forms with cascading parameters, calculated custom data fields, and multiple value options in a single field.

1. To save your changes, click **Apply** and move on to another section to continue building your form.

    or

    Click **Save and Close**. 

 ### Add text fields

 You can add several different text fields to a custom form. 

+++ **Expand to see descriptions of available text fields**

* **Single Line Text Field**: Allows users to type a single line of text in the field.
* **Paragraph Text Field**: Allows users to type multiple lines of text in the field.
* **Text Field with Formatting**: Allows users to type multiple lines of text in the field and format the text with bold, italics, underline, bullets, numbering, hyperlinks, and block quotes. A character limit of 15,000 allows for plenty of text and formatting.

    For information about accessing this field through the API, see Rich text field storage in the API.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Text fields with formatting are not available for Workfront mobile apps (available in coming releases).
* **Descriptive text**: Allows you to include instructions and link to pages outside Workfront.

+++

To add a text field: 

1. On the left side of the screen, find one of the following text fields and drag it to a section on the canvas:

    * Single Line Text:
    * Paragraph Text
    * Text field with formatting
    * Descriptive texts

    ![](assets/drag-field-to-section.png)

1. On the right side of the screen, configure the options that are available for the type of custom field you are adding:

   <table>
    <tr>
    <td>Input into</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Available for </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Label</td>
    <td><p>Type a descriptive label to display above the widget. You can change the label at any time.<p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: Avoid using special characters in this label. They don't display correctly in reports.</p></td>
    <td><ul>
    <li>Single line text</li>
    <li>Paragraph text</li>
    <li>Text with formatting</li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Name</td>
    <td><p>(Required) This name is how the system identifies the field. When you are configuring the widget for the first time and you type the label, the Name field populates automatically to match it. But the Label and Name fields are not synchronized—this gives you the freedom to change the label that your users see without having to change the name that the system sees.</p>
    <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>:   
      <ul> 
      <li>Though it's possible to do so, we recommend that you do not change this name after you or other users start using the custom form in Workfront. If you do, the system will no longer recognize the custom field where it might now be referenced in other areas of Workfront. <p>For example, if you add the custom field to a report and later change its name, Workfront doesn't recognize it in the report and it will stop functioning correctly there unless you re-add it to the report using the new name.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>We recommend that you do not type a name that is already used for built-in Workfront fields.</p> </li>
      <li><p>We recommend that you do not use the period/dot character in the custom field name, to prevent errors when using the field in different areas of Workfront.</p></li>
    </td>
    <td><ul>
    <li>Single line text</li>
    <li>Paragraph text</li>
    <li>Text with formatting</li>
    <li>Descriptive text</li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Instructions</td>
    <td>Type any additional information about the widget. When users fill out the custom form, they can hover over the question mark icon to view a tool tip containing the information you type here.

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Format</td>
    <td><p>Select the type of data that will be captured in the custom field.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>:   
    <ul> 
    <li>This field cannot be edited after the form is saved. If you intend to use your field in mathematical calculations, ensure that you select a Number or Currency format.<br></li> 
    <li>When you select Number or Currency, the system automatically truncates numbers that start with 0.</li> 
     </ul></p></td> </td>
    <td><ul>
    <li>Single line text</li>
    <li>Paragraph text</li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Display Type</td>
    <td>Switch between single line and paragraph text fields.</td>
    <td><ul>
    <li>Single line text</li>
    <li>Paragraph text</li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Hyperlink</td>
    <td> If you want to apply a hyperlink to the Descriptive Text you have typed, add it here. The Descriptive text displays as a link on objects where the form is attached.</td>
    <td><ul><li>Descriptive text</li></ul></td>
    </tr>
   </table>

1. To save your changes, click **Apply** and move on to another section to continue building your form.

    or

    Click **Save and Close**. 

 ### Add calculated fields

 In a custom form, you can add a calculated custom field that uses existing data to generate new data when the custom form is attached to an object. 

To add a calcuated field, see [Add calculated fields with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/add-a-calculated-field.md).

 ### Add radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns

    <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
     <td> <p>(Required) This name is how the system identifies the custom field when you add it to various areas throughout Workfront, such as reports, Home, and API interactions.</p> <p>When you are configuring the custom field for the first time and you type the label, the Name field populates automatically to match it. But the Label and Name fields are not synchronized—this gives you the freedom to change the label that your users see without having to change the name that the system sees.</p>

>When you add a video to a custom form this way, only the permissions set for the custom form apply to the video when users access the form on an object, not the permissions that were set for the video in the Documents area.

1. Go to the video in the Documents area and generate a proof for it, as described in [Create an interactive proof for a website or other web content](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-interactive-proof-for-website-or-other-web-content.md).
1. Open the proof.
1. Right-click anywhere on the video, then select **Copy Video Address**.
1. In the custom form where you are adding the video widget, paste the copied address in the **URL** box.

 ### Add Adobe XD files

 You can add an Adobe XD prototype directly to a custom form. Users who work with the object the custom form is attached to can see the Adobe XD file only in the following areas:

* The object's Details area (for example, for a project, the Project Details area)
* The Edit box for the object, if it has the new Adobe Workfront experience look and feel (for example, the Edit Project and Edit Task boxes)

 To add an Adobe XD file:

1. On the left side of the screen, find **Adobe XD** and drag it to a section on the canvas. 
1. Type or edit any of the following properties for the widget:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Label</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) Type a descriptive label to display above the widget. You can change the label at any time.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Avoid using special characters in this label. They don't display correctly in reports.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) This name is how the system identifies the widget. When you are configuring the widget for the first time and you type the label, the Name field populates automatically to match it. But the Label and Name fields are not synchronized—this gives you the freedom to change the label that your users see without having to change the name that the system sees.</p>
    <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>:   
      <ul> 
      <li>Though it's possible to do so, we recommend that you do not change this name after you or other users start using the custom form in Workfront. If you do, the system will no longer recognize the custom field where it might now be referenced in other areas of Workfront. <p>For example, if you add the custom field to a report and later change its name, Workfront doesn't recognize it in the report and it will stop functioning correctly there unless you re-add it to the report using the new name.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>We recommend that you do not type a name that is already used for built-in Workfront fields.</p> </li>
      <li><p>We recommend that you do not use the period/dot character in the custom field name, to prevent errors when using the field in different areas of Workfront.</p></td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">URL</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) Type or paste a valid XD prototype link.</p> 
      <p>Note: The Link Access setting on the Share tab in Adobe XD must be set to Anyone with the link. Otherwise, users will not be able to view the prototype. 
   </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Instructions</td> 
      <td> <p>Type any additional information about the widget. When users fill out the custom form, they can hover over the question mark icon to view a tool tip containing the information you type here.
    <img src="assets/instructions-form-designer.png"></p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Size</td> 
      <td>(Optional) Change the display size of the widget as needed.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>
