# Set a custom condition as the default for tasks and issues

When a user clicks Work on It or adds an update comment to a new task they have been assigned to (without manually setting a condition for the task), Adobe Workfront displays the default condition for tasks, which is configured in Setup. The same is true for issues.

Workfront uses the built-in condition Going Smoothly as the default condition for tasks and, separately, for issues. As a Workfront administrator, you can change the default condition for both of these object types to a custom condition you have created.

## Set a custom condition as a default condition for tasks or for issues:

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. Click **Project Preferences** > **Conditions**.

1. Click the **Tasks** or **Issues** tab. 

1. Click **Set Default Conditions**. 
1. In the drop-down menu, click the custom condition you want as the default condition for tasks (or issues). 
1. Click **Save**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* A user who is assigned to a task or issue, or who has Manage permissions on it, can change its condition manually. For more information, see [Update Condition for tasks and issues](../../../manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/update-condition-for-tasks-and-issues.md).
>* The three default conditions for tasks and issues that come with Workfront are Going Smoothly, Some Concerns, and Major Roadblocks. You cannot hide or delete these conditions, but you can change their names and colors. Or you can create new ones to use instead, as described in [Create or edit a custom condition](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-conditions/create-edit-custom-conditions.md).
