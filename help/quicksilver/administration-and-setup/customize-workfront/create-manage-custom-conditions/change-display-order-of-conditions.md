# Change the display order of conditions

You can change the order in which conditions display in projects, tasks and issues:

* When a user is changing the condition for a task or issue

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >In the default Condition view, the **Condition** field is a type of field that can't be edited inline. When you add the **Condition** field separately to a view, it is editable. For information about inline editing, see [Inline edit items in a list in Adobe Workfront](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/inline-edit-objects.md).
