# Custom conditions

A condition is a visual representation of how a project, task, or issue is progressing. As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use the conditions created by Workfront for use in projects, tasks, and issues, or you can create custom conditions to more closely match the needs of your organization.

This section contains the following articles:

* [Create or edit a custom condition](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-conditions/create-edit-custom-conditions.md) 
* [Change the display order of conditions](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-conditions/change-display-order-of-conditions.md) 
* [Set a custom condition as the default for projects](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-conditions/set-custom-condition-default-projects.md) 
* [Set a custom condition as the default for tasks and issues](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-conditions/set-custom-condition-default-tasks-issues.md) 
* [Delete a custom condition](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-conditions/delete-custom-conditions.md)

For more information about conditions and how to apply them to projects, tasks, and issues, see [Overview of Project Condition and Condition Type](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/project-condition-and-condition-type.md) and [Update Condition for tasks and issues](../../../manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/update-condition-for-tasks-and-issues.md).
