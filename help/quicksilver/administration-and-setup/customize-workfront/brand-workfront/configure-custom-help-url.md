# Configure a custom help URL

If you create a custom internal help site containing information about how your organization uses Workfront, you can configure the Main Menu Help icon to go to that site.

This does not affect the context-sensitive help links throughout Workfront, which take users to the Workfront Help site.

For information about how users access both a custom help URL that you configure in Workfront and the regular Workfront help site, see [Access Adobe Workfront help](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/access-workfront-help.md).

## Configure a custom Help URL

{{step-1-to-setup}}

1. Click **System** > **Preferences**.
1. In the **General Preferences** section, in the **Custom Help URL** field, type the URL where your custom help site is located.

   If your custom help location requires login credentials, those credentials are required for users when they access the site from Workfront. The credentials to your custom help site might need to be managed separately from the Workfront credentials if you are not using Single Sign-On (SSO).

1. Click **Save**.
