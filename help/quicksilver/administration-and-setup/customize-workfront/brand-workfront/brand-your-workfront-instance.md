>* A Workfront administrator or group administrator can also brand Workfront for certain groups and users using a layout template. Branding in a layout template overrides the system-level branding explained in this article. For instructions on branding in a layout template, see [Brand Adobe Workfront using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/brand-wf-using-a-layout-template.md).

         <ul>

Use a high-resolution image (up to 2 MB) for the best results.</p> <p>When you use this option, the Workfront banner, which is not customizable, obscures part your image.</p> </li> 
          <li> <p><strong>Tile</strong>: Tiles your image across the login screen background area, in its original size. This is useful for creating a pattern. Select a blue alignment option to start the tiling from the top-left corner, top-center, or top-right of the background area.</p> </li> 
          <li> <p><strong>Position</strong>: Places your image in its original size in the position you choose using one of the blue alignment options: the top-left, top-center, or top-right of the login screen background area.</p> <p>The background color fills the rest of the login screen background area. For more about the background color, see the preceding row in this table.</p> </li>
