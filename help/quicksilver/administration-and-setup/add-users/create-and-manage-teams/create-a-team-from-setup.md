## Create a team

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. Click **Teams**, then click **New Team**.

1. In the **New Team** box that displays, specify the following information:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Team Name</td> 
      <td>Type a name for the team.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Group</td> 
      <td> <p>If you want to associate the team with a group, start typing the name of the group, then select the name when it appears.</p> <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">You can make sure you are associating the right group with the team by hovering over it and clicking the information icon <img src="assets/info-icon.png"> that displays next to it. This displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and its administrators.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: When a team is assigned to a group or subgroup, any group administrators of that group or subgroup can manage the team without being a member of it. Group administrators can go to the Teams area from the Main Menu and click the Switch Teams arrow <img src="assets/switch-team-icon.png" alt="Switch team icon"> to list all of the teams that are assigned to the groups that they manage.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Team Members</td> 
      <td> <p>Begin typing the name of a user to be on the team, then select the name when in appears in the drop-down list. Repeat this process to add multiple users to the team.</p> <p>There is no limit to how many users you can add to a team. However, we recommend to not have an excessively large number of users in one team, because the team's work management might become too complex.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Description</td> 
      <td>Type a description for the team.</td> 
     </tr>

     </tr>

## Team owners

When you create a team you become the team owner, by default.

You can view team owners for all the teams when you create a report for teams and include the Owner Name field in your report. (For more information about creating a report, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).)
