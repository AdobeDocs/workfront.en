# Access to objects and areas by new licenses

<!-- Audited: 2/2024 -->

The table below tells you the highest level of access (Edit or View) that each of the Adobe Workfront licenses allow for the objects and areas in Workfront.

* **View**: The user can review and share items.
* **Edit**: The user can create, edit, delete, and share items.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >When another user shares an object, the sharer can specify permissions that limit their ability to edit it. For more information, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

&#42; Users with a Contributor license can view only reports, dashboards, and calendars that are shared with them.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Users with a Light license or a Contributor license have limited sharing capabilities. For more information, see [Licenses overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/how-access-levels-work/licenses-overview.md).
>
>External users cannot search for items in Workfront. They can view documents and calendars that are specifically shared with them. They can also see the users that share items with them.
