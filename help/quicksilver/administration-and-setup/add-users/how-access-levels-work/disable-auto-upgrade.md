# Disable the auto-upgrade option for non-paid users on the new licensing plan 

Proof and document decisions are limited for all non-paid Workfront licenses on the new plans. When users reach their allotted number of decisions, they are upgraded to a Light license by default.

You can disable the auto-upgrade option from the setup area. To learn more about how auto-upgrades work, see [Limited document and proof decision for non-paid users overview](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proof-doc-decision-limits.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Once disabled, any non-paid user who goes over their allotted number of decisions will not be upgraded automatically.
