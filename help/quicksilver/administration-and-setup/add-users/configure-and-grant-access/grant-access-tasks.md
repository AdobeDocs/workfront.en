# Grant access to tasks

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use an access level to define a user's access to tasks, as explained in [Access levels overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-levels-overview.md). 

For information about using custom access levels to manage users' access to other object types in Workfront, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

## Configure user access to tasks using a custom access level

1. Begin creating or editing the access level, as explained in [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).
1. Click the gear icon ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png) on the **View** or **Edit** button to the right of Tasks, then select the abilities you want to grant under **Fine-tune your settings**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When you configure an access level setting for a certain type of object, that configuration doesn't affect the users' access to objects with a lower rank. For example, you can restrict users from deleting tasks in their access level, but this does not restrict them from deleting issues, which are lower-ranking than tasks.For more information about the hierarchy of objects, see the section [Interdependency and hierarchy of objects](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md#understanding-interdependency-and-hierarchy-of-objects) in the article [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md).

1. (Optional) To restrict inherited permissions for tasks from higher ranking objects, click **Set additional restrictions**, then select **Never inherit document access from projects, tasks, issues, etc**.

1. (Optional) To configure access settings for other objects and areas in the access level you are working on, continue with one of the articles listed in [Configure access to Adobe Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/configure-access.md), such as [Grant access to financial data](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-financial.md).
1. When you are finished, click **Save**.

   After the access level is created, you can assign it to a user. For more information, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

## Access to tasks by license type

For information about what users in each access level can do with tasks, see the section [Tasks](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md#tasks) in the article [Functionality available for each object type](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md).

## Access to shared tasks

As the owner or creator of an issue, you can share with other users by granting them permissions to it, as explained in [Share a task](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-task.md).

</div>

When you share any object with another user, the recipient's rights on it are determined by a combination of two things:

* The permissions that you grant to your recipient for the object
* The recipient's access level settings for the object's type
