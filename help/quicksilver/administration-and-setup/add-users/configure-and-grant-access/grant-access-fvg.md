# Grant access to filters, views, and groupings

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use an access level to define a user's access to the filter, view, and grouping controls for lists and reports, as explained in [Access levels overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-levels-overview.md).

For information about the filter, view, and grouping controls, see [Reporting elements: filters, views, and groupings](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/reporting-elements-filters-views-groupings.md).

## Access requirements

## Configure user access to filters, views, and groupings using a custom access level

1. Begin creating or editing the access level, as explained in [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).
1. Click the gear icon ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png) on the **View** or **Edit** button to the right of Filters, then select the abilities you want to grant under **Fine-tune your settings**.

   ![](assets/gear-icon-filters-dashboards-groupings.jpg)

   By default, users with a Plan, Work, Reviewer, or Request license have full View and Edit abilities. Users with an External User license do not access to filters, views, and groupings.

   <!--If this changes, undraft section with table below
   -->

1. (Optional) To configure access settings for other objects and areas in the access level you are working on, continue with one of the articles listed in [Configure access to Adobe Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/configure-access.md), such as [Grant access to tasks](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-tasks.md) and [Grant access to financial data](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-financial.md).
1. When you are finished, click **Save**.

   After the access level is created, you can assign it to a user. For more information, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

<!--## Access to filters, views, and groupings by license type

Drafting out this section for now because the table is redundant since all four license types can do everything.</span>-->

This table lists what a Workfront administrator can allow users with each license type to do with filter, views, and groupings. For information about the Workfront license types, see [Adobe Workfront licenses overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md).
