# Grant access to documents

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use an access level to define a user's access to documents, as explained in [Access levels overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-levels-overview.md). 

This access also applies to document folders.

For information about using custom access levels to manage users' access to other object types in Workfront, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

## Configure user access to documents using a custom access level

1. Begin creating or editing the access level, as explained in [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).
1. Click the gear icon ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png) on the **View** or **Edit** button to the right of Documents, then select the abilities you want to grant under **Fine-tune your settings**.

   You can allow users to do the following on projects, tasks, and issues that they have access to:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Create</td> 
      <td>Upload documents.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Delete</td> 
      <td> <p>Remove uploaded documents.</p> <p>The <b>Create</b> option is automatically enabled when this option is enabled.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Share</td> 
      <td>Share documents with specific users, job roles, teams.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Share Documents Publicly</td> 
      <td>Share documents with external users (don't have a Workfront license).</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Share System-wide</td> 
      <td> <p>Make documents available to everyone in your Workfront instance.</p> <p>Anyone in the system can see a document shared this way if:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> <p>You send them a link to the Documents page where it's uploaded.</p> </li> 
        <li> <p>They search for it in Workfront</p> </li> 
       </ul> <p>The <b>Share</b> option is automatically enabled when this option is enabled.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When you configure an access level setting for a certain type of object, that configuration doesn't affect the users' access to objects with a lower rank. For example, you can restrict users from deleting projects in their access level, but this does not restrict them from deleting documents, which are lower-ranking than projects.For more information about the hierarchy of objects, see the section [Interdependency and hierarchy of objects](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md#understanding-interdependency-and-hierarchy-of-objects) in the article [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md).

1. (Optional) To restrict inherited permissions for documents from higher ranking objects, click **Set additional restrictions**, then select **Never inherit document access from projects, tasks, issues, etc**.
1. (Optional) To configure access settings for other objects and areas in the access level you are working on, continue with one of the articles listed in [Configure access to Adobe Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/configure-access.md), such as [Grant access to tasks](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-tasks.md) and [Grant access to financial data](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-financial.md).
1. When you are finished, click **Save**.

   After the access level is created, you can assign it to a user. For more information, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

## Access to documents by license type

For more information about what users in each access level can do with documents, see the section [Documents](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md#document) in the article [Functionality available for each object type](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md).

## Access to shared documents

After you upload a document to Workfront, you can share it with other users by granting them permissions to it, as explained in [Share a document](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/document-permissions.md).

<!--
If you make changes here, make them also in the "Grant access to" articles where this snippet had to be converted to text:
* reports, dashboards, and calendars
* financial data<
* issue
-->

When you share any object with another user, the recipient's rights on it are determined by a combination of two things:

* The permissions that you grant to your recipient for the object
* The recipient's access level settings for the object's type
