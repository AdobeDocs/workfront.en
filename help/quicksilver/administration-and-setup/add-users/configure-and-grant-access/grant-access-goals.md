# Grant access to Adobe Workfront Goals

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use an access level to define a user's access to Adobe Workfront Goals, as explained in [Access levels overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-levels-overview.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to grant users access to Workfront Goals:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>Workfront Goals <p>Contact your Workfront account manager to learn about a Workfront Goals license. </p> <p>Workfront Goals is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience. For information about enrolling users in the new Adobe Workfront experience, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/enroll-users-new-workfront-experience.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Enroll users in the new Adobe Workfront experience</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configuration*</td> 
   <td> <p>You must have the System Administrator access level. For information about this access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>
