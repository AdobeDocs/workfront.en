# Grant a user full administrative access

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that have not yet been onboarded to the Admin Console. If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, you must perform this action through the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>For instructions on granting full administrator access in the Adobe Admin Console, see [Manage system administrators in the Adobe Admin Console](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/admin-console.md).
>
>For a list of procedures that differ based on whether your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can create another Workfront administrator by assigning them the System Administrator access level. A user with this access level has full administrative access to everything in Workfront, including items they did not create themselves.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This is different from using an access level to grant users administrative access to certain areas of the system. For more information, see the following:
>
>* [Grant users administrative access to certain areas](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-users-admin-access-certain-areas.md) 
>* [Access of a Workfront administrator vs. access of a Plan user with administrative rights](#access-of-a-workfront-administrator-vs-access-of-a-plan-user-with-administrative-rights) in this article
>

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td>Plan</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="#" class="MCXref xref selected">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Grant full System Administrator access to a single user

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Users** ![](assets/users-icon-in-main-menu.png).   

1. Click the name of the user to whom you want to grant administrator rights.
1. Click the More menu ![](assets/more-icon.png), then click **Edit**.  

1. On the **Edit Person** box that appears, click **Access**.

1. In the **access level** drop-down list, select the **System Administrator** access level.

   Depending on changes made in your system, the name of this access level might have changed.

1. Click **Save Changes.**

   The user now has full System Administrator rights in the system.

## Access of a Workfront administrator vs. access of a Plan user with administrative rights  {#access-of-a-workfront-administrator-vs-access-of-a-plan-user-with-administrative-rights}

The two tables below show the difference between the access rights of a user with a Workfront administrator access level versus those of a user with a Plan license with some administrative rights.

Workfront administrators can view all the objects in the system (regardless of who created them), create new ones, and modify or delete existing ones. They have full access to all objects in the system.

Users with a Plan license who can edit functionality in one area have full access to the functionality in that area.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Users with a Plan license who are designated as group administrators can perform some of the actions allowed for Workfront administrators. They are allowed to perform these actions only for the groups they administer, their subgroups, and the users in these groups and subgroups. For more information, see [Group administrators](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md).
