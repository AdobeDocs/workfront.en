# Manage users in the Adobe Admin Console

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment for all customers. After the monthly releases to Production, the same features are also available in the Production environment for customers who enabled fast releases. </span>   

<span class="preview">For information about fast releases, see [Enable or disable fast releases for your organization](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/enable-fast-release-process.md). </span>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The functionality in this article is available only if your organization's instance of Workfront has been onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform.
>
>For a list of procedures that differ based on whether your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

As an Adobe administrator, you can create Adobe Workfront system administrators using the Adobe Admin Console. The console is a central location for managing the Adobe entitlements across your organization. For more information, see the [Admin Console Overview](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>We recommend adding non-system administrator users directly in Workfront. It is possible to add users in the Adobe Admin Console, but adding them in Workfront allows you to set their access level while creating them, which can save you time.

<span class="preview">When making changes to users' profiles from the Admin Console, an update is added to the System activity tab of the user in Workfront. The update shows as made by the "System". This refers to the Adobe Admin Console administrator and not to the Workfront main Administrator.</span>

## Prerequisites

Before using the Admin Console for Workfront, you should receive an email inviting you to the console.

1. If you are new to Adobe and you have received an email telling you that you now have administer rights to manage Adobe software and services for your organization, click the button in the email to create an Adobe account and open the Admin Console.

   Or

   If you already have an Adobe account, go to the [Adobe Admin Console page](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/).

## Additional details about the Adobe Admin Console

* Workfront System Administrators can deactivate a Workfront user from within Workfront, but this does not deactivate the user in the Admin Console.

  <!--
  <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">For information about deactivating a user in Workfront, see </p>
  -->

* The user **Home Group** is determined based on the user who created them. This is not customizable from within the Admin Console.
* The Workfront System Administrator access level can only be edited from within the Adobe Admin Console.

  <!--
  DRAFTED IN FLARE:
  How is this done?
  
  -->

* Changing a user's access from System Administrator to any other access level must be done through the Admin Console first.

  <!--
   This is not clear
  -->

* To remove System Administrator access from a user in Workfront, you must use the Adobe Admin Console to remove the user as Product Profile Administrator. This changes the user's Workfront access level from System Administrator to Requestor.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >Do not make any changes to the Product Profile itself.

## Access the user and admin area for your Production instance of Workfront {#access-the-user-and-admin-area-for-your-production-instance-of-workfront}

   This is your Production instance where your users work.

   <!--![](assets/instances-1.png)-->

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The second link in the list, your Preview instance, is a testing environment that replicates your live Production environment. For more information, see [The Adobe Workfront Preview Sandbox Environment](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/wf-preview-sandbox-environment.md).

   >You might also see links to sandbox environments in the list. For more information, see [The Adobe Workfront Preview Sandbox Environment](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/wf-preview-sandbox-environment.md).

1. In the list that displays, with the **Product Profiles** tab selected, click the name of the Workfront Product Profile link.

   ![](assets/prod-profile-1.png)

   This list includes all users that are already assigned to your Production instance of Workfront.

1. Select the **Admins** tab above the list of users. 
1. Select **Add Admin**.
1. In the **Add product profile administrators** box, enter the email addresses or names of the administrators you want to add, then select **Save**.

### Create users in Workfront directly in the Adobe Admin Console

1. Go to the user and admin area in the Admin Console, as described in the section [Access the user and admin area for your Production instance of Workfront](#access-the-user-and-admin-area-for-your-production-instance-of-workfront) in this article.
1. With the **Users** tab selected above the list, select **Add User**.
1. In the **Add users to this product profile** box, enter the email address or name of a user you want to add, then select **Save**.

   The user is created in Workfront with the Requestor access level.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Do not make any changes to the Product Profile itself.

1. In Workfront, change the user's access level.

   For instructions on how a Workfront administrator can change the user's access level, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add more users.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For new Adobe users, the Admin Console delivers an email to invite them to complete the registration process. All users must complete the registration process to access any Adobe application.
   >
   >For existing Adobe users, the user may or may not receive an email about Workfront being available. This is a preference controlled by the Adobe administrator for the product. Your Adobe administrator may be a different person than your Workfront administrator.

### Create users in Workfront and approve them for the Adobe Admin Console

This workflow allows group administrators that do not have access to the Adobe Admin Console to create users.

First, the group administrator creates the user in Workfront. This creates the user in Deactivated and Pending Approval status.

Then, a Workfront administrator approves the user. This activates the user in Workfront and adds them to the Adobe Admin Console.

#### Create the user in Workfront (Group administrator)

For instructions on creating a user in Workfront, see [Add users](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).

#### Approve the user (Workfront administrator)

To approve a user:

{{step-1-to-users}}

1. Select the user, then click the **More** icon ![](assets/more-icon.png).

1. To approve the user, click **Approve**, then click **Submit**. 

   Or

   To reject the user and delete them from Workfront, click **Reject**, then click **Submit**.

   Approved users are automatically added to the Adobe Admin Console.

   Rejected users are automatically deleted from Workfront.
