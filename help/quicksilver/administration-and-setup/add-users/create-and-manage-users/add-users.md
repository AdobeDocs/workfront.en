## Prerequisites

Before you add a user, gather the information about the user listed below and determine which information you want to associate with that user:

* What is the user's personal information? At a minimum you need the following:

   * Full name
   * A user name
   * Default password
   * Email address

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >You can determine whether users can view other users' contact information by fine-tuning the Users View setting when specifying access levels for Workfront objects. For more information, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

* What is the position of the new user within the company? Does this person have any direct reports? Who does this person report to?
* What job role does the person fill? Does this job role exist in Workfront? Is there a limit to the number of people who can fill this job role? For information about creating job roles, see [Create and manage job roles](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/create-manage-job-roles.md).
* What access level should the user have? Does it already exist or do you need to create a new one? For more information, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).
* What home group should this user be in? Should the person be in more than one group? For information about groups, see [Groups overview](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/groups-overview/groups.md).
* What home team should this user be in? Should the person be on more than one team? For information about teams, see [Teams overview](../../../people-teams-and-groups/create-and-manage-teams/teams-overview.md).
* What custom information do you need to associate with this user?

  If information about users is captured in custom fields that you created, you must have a custom form ready when creating a user. For information about custom forms, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).

## Create a user from scratch

{{step-1-to-users}}

1. Click **New User > New User** to add a user who has not yet been added to Workfront.

   Or

   Click **New User > Import Users** to add users by uploading a spreadsheet import file.

   If you are importing users, you don't need to continue these steps. For more information, see [Import users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/import-users.md).

1. In the **New User** box that appears, click **Show Advanced Options**, then configure the available options to enter the person's information.

   For information about these options, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

1. Do one of the following:

   * Leave **Send an invite email to this person** enabled. If you do this, the user receives an email where they can follow a link to create their own password for Workfront. Users who do not accept the email invitation and create a Workfront password are listed as Unregistered in Workfront.
   * Disable **Send an invite email to this person**, then type a **Password** for the person and confirm it in the **Confirm Password** box. You will need to share this password with the user outside of Workfront.
 
   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* If your Workfront administrator enabled an SSO integration with Workfront, then the Only Allow &lt;SSO Configuration&gt; Authentication field is hidden if you disable the email invitation. The Federation ID or &lt;SSO Configuration&gt; Username field remains visible.
   >
   >* If your organization has been onboarded to the Admin Console and you add a user through Workfront, you do not have the option to send an email invitation.
   >
   >   For existing Adobe users, the user may or may not receive an email about Workfront being available. This is a preference controlled by the Adobe administrator for the product.

1. Click **Add This Person**.

   Or

   Click **Add Person & Start Another** to save the new user and add another one.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you are a group administrator adding a user to an organization that has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, the options for this step are **Submit user for Admin Approval** and **Submit for Approval & Start Another**. The user is created in a Deactivated and Pending Approval status. A Workfront administrator must approve the user, which activates the user in Workfront and adds them to the Adobe Admin Console.

## Copy a user to create a new one

You can create a user by copying an existing user.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you create a user this way, all information is copied from the original user to the newly created user except for the following:
>
>* The information in the Personal Info section.
>* When I log in, show: The default landing tab for the access level is selected in this box.
>* Direct Reports
>

To create new user by copying an existing one:

{{step-1-to-users}}

1. Select the user that you want to copy, then click the Copy icon ![Copy icon](assets/copy-icon.png).
1. In the **Copy User** box that displays, edit the fields available for the new user.

   For information about all fields associated with a user, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

1. Click **Add This Person**.        

   Or

   Click **Add Person & Start Another** to save the new user and add another one.

This creates a new account in Workfront for the user.

If you selected the option to send an invitation to the user, they should receive an email where they can follow a link to create their Workfront password.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your organization has been onboarded to the Admin Console and you add a user through Workfront, you do not have the option to send an email invitation.
>
>For existing Adobe users, the user may or may not receive an email about Workfront being available. This is a preference controlled by the Adobe administrator for the product.
