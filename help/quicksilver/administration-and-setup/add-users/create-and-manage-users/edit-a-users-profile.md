# Edit a user's profile


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that have not yet been onboarded to the Admin Console. If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, you must perform this action through the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>For instructions on editing a user's profile in the Adobe Admin Console, see the section "Edit user details" in the article [Manage users individually](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-users-individually.html) or contact your Adobe Admin Console Administrator.
>
>For a list of procedures that differ based on whether your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can create new users and manage the profiles of existing ones. For information about creating users, see [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).

Users with a Plan license can also create and manage users. For information about the access needed to edit users, see [Grant access to users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-other-users.md).

      The field's default is 1, indicating that a user spends their entire FTE on actual, project-related work.  

      The system uses this number to calculate the availability of the user for actual, project-related work. 

      For more information about creating schedules in Workfront, see <a href="../../set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md">Create a schedule</a>.

      Schedule exceptions and time off might also affect the user capacity. 

      Workfront calculates a user's availability depending on the Resource Management preferences in your Setup area. For more information, see <a href="../../set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md">Configure Resource Management preferences</a>. 

      <b>TIP</b>

      Set the Work Time value to  1 to indicate that the user is available for project-related work their entire full-time equivalent.

      <li> <b>Schedule Deactivation</b>: Check this box if you want to schedule this user to be deactivated after a period of time. </li>

       <li> <p><b>Other Roles</b>: A user can have multiple job roles in Workfront. Job roles are essential in resource management. There is no limit for how many job roles a user can fulfill. However, we recommend to not assign one user to an excessively large number of job roles, because resource management might become too complex for these users.<p>Only active job roles display in the list.

       <li> <p>(Conditional) If you selected one or multiple <b>Other Roles</b>, the <b>Percentage of FTE Availability</b> field displays for each role.

The default value for the Percentage of FTE Availability for the Other Roles is 0%.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>:  If Other Roles have a 0% FTE Availability, they do not display in the Resource Planner, unless the users are assigned to tasks in these roles.</p> <p> <img alt="user_settings_roles_and_dte_boxes_rp_story.png" src="assets/user-settings-roles-and-dte-boxes-rp-story.png"> </p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: <p>The sum of all <b>Percentages of FTE Availability</b> for all roles must equal 100%. Each Percentage of FTE Availability calculates the Available Hours for each role per user in the Resource Planner.

       <li> <p><b>Timesheet Profile</b>: Associate a Timesheet Profile with the user to ensure that timesheets generate automatically for the user.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>:  The list of profiles you have available in this field depends on your access:
       <ul>
       <li>As a Workfront administrator, you can see all system-level and all group-level Timesheet Profiles.</li>
       <li>As a group administrator, you can see system-level Timesheet Profiles, as well as those associated with the groups that you manage.</li>
       <li>As a user with a Plan license and access to edit users, you can see only system-level Timesheet Profiles.

      </ul></p> </li> 
       <li><b>Default Hour Type</b>: Select the default hour type for the user. This is the hour type that is used by default when the user logs time.</li> 
       <li><b>Available Hour Types</b>: Select the hour types that should be available to the user. These hour types are visible everywhere in Workfront where the user can log time. A user can only see the hour types that are enabled at the project level as well as the user level. For more information about what hour types are available to users, see <a href="../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/define-hour-types-and-availability.md" class="MCXref xref">Define hour types and availability for timesheets</a>.</li> 
       <li><b>Log Time in:</b> Select whether the user should log time on work items in hours or days.

      <li> <b>FTE</b>: This is the Full Time Equivalent of the user. Workfront uses this number to calculate the availability of the user based on the Default Schedule only when the Resource Management Preferences at the system level are set to The Default Schedule. 

      <p>The FTE indicates the amount of time that the user can spend at work. This includes overhead, as well as time spent on project work. For example, time that is spent in meetings, or training is also included in the FTE.</p> 

      The FTE must be a decimal number up to 1, and it cannot be 0. For example, if the FTE value is 0.5 and the Default Schedule in Workfront is 40 hours, the user is available for 20 hours a week. 

      The field's default is 1.

      Schedule exceptions, time off might, and the value of Work Time may affect the availability of the user. 

      Workfront calculates a user's availability depending on the Resource Management preferences in your Setup area.

      If the Resource Management Preferences at the system level are set to The User's Schedule, the value you specify here is ignored and the user is considered to be available according to what is specified in their schedule.
