# Edit a user's profile

{{highlighted-preview}}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that have not yet been onboarded to the Admin Console. If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, you must perform this action through the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>For instructions on editing a user's profile in the Adobe Admin Console, see the section "Edit user details" in the article [Manage users individually](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-users-individually.html) or contact your Adobe Admin Console Administrator.
>
>For a list of procedures that differ based on whether your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can create users and manage the profiles of existing ones. For information about creating users, see [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).

       <p>When you assign an access level to a user, you can assign a level equal to or lower than your own access level.</p>

       <p>For example, if you have a Plan license with no access to delete tasks, you cannot assign someone a Work license with access to delete tasks, although the Work license is lower than the Plan license.

      The field's default is 1, indicating that a user spends their entire FTE on actual, project-related work.  

      The system uses this number to calculate the availability of the user for actual, project-related work. 

      For more information about creating schedules in Workfront, see <a href="../../set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md">Create a schedule</a>.

      Schedule exceptions and time off might also affect the user's capacity. 

      Workfront calculates a user's availability depending on the Resource Management preferences in your Setup area. For more information, see <a href="../../set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md">Configure Resource Management preferences</a>. 

      <b>TIP</b>

      Set the Work Time value to 1 to indicate that the user is available for project-related work their entire full-time equivalent.

       <li><b>Available Hour Types</b>: Select the hour types that should be available to the user. These hour types are visible everywhere in Workfront where the user can log time. A user can only see the hour types that are enabled at the project level as well as the user level. For more information about what hour types are available to users, see <a href="../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/define-hour-types-and-availability.md" class="MCXref xref">Define hour types and availability for timesheets</a>.</li> 
       <li><b>Log Time in:</b> Select whether the user should log time on work items in hours or days.

      <li> <b>FTE</b>: This is the Full Time Equivalent of the user. Workfront uses this number to calculate the availability of the user based on the Default Schedule only when the Resource Management Preferences at the system level are set to The Default Schedule. 

      <p>The FTE indicates the amount of time that the user can spend at work. This includes overhead, as well as time spent on project work. For example, time that is spent in meetings, or training is also included in the FTE.</p> 

      The FTE must be a decimal number up to 1, and it cannot be 0. For example, if the FTE value is 0.5 and the Default Schedule in Workfront is 40 hours, the user is available for 20 hours a week. 

      The field's default is 1.

      Schedule exceptions, time off might, and the value of Work Time may affect the availability of the user. 

      Workfront calculates a user's availability depending on the Resource Management preferences in your Setup area.

      If the Resource Management Preferences at the system level are set to The User's Schedule, the value you specify here is ignored and the user is considered to be available according to what is specified in their schedule. 

      For more information, see <a href="../../set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md">Configure Resource Management preferences</a>.
