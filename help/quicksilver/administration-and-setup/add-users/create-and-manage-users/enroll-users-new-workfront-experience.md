>[!NOTE]

>The weekly refresh of the Preview environment does not affect user enrollment in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

By default, new users have Adobe Workfront Classic as their personal Workfront environment. As a Workfront administrator or a group administrator, you can manually enroll users in the new Adobe Workfront experience, or you can manually remove users who are already enrolled.

For more information about the new experience, see [the new Workfront experience page](https://one.workfront.com/s/new-workfront-experience).

``` ```**Tip: **`````` As an Adobe Workfront administrator or a group administrator, you can change your own Workfront environment by doing one of the following:

* Selecting Switch to the new experience from the user menu in the Global Navigation Bar
* Selecting Switch to Classic in the Main Menu.

For more information, see [Switch your admin account to Adobe Workfront Classic](#switch) or [Switch your admin account to the new Adobe Workfront experience](#switch2).
