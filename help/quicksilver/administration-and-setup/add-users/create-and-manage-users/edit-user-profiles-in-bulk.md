# Edit user profiles in bulk

<!--

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that have not yet been onboarded to the Admin Console. If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, you must perform this action through the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>For instructions on editing a user's profile in the Adobe Admin Console, see the section "Edit user details" in the article [Bulk Upload Users](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/bulk-upload-users.html) or contact your Adobe Admin Console Administrator.
>
>For a list of procedures that differ based on whether your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).
-->

You can edit user accounts in bulk. When bulk editing users, only the fields you specifically select are updated with the same information for all users selected. All other fields that you leave unselected stay the same for each individual user, even if they are different for each user.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* You cannot bulk edit the Personal Info section of the users' profiles because that information must be unique for every user.
>* To ensure accuracy of data and optimal performance, we recommend that you select no more than 2000 users at one time for a bulk edit.

## Edit user accounts in bulk

{{step-1-to-users}}

1. Select more than one user, then click the Edit icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png).

1. In the **Edit User** box that appears, change any of the following options:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Preferences</td> 
      <td> 
       <ul> 
        <li><b>Time Zone:</b> The users' time zone.</li> 
        <li><b>Locale</b>: The users' preferred locale. This affects the format of numbers and dates in the emails that come from Workfront.</li> 
        <li><b>Send work I assign to myself to my Working On tab</b>: This setting refers to a deprecated feature that has been removed from Workfront.</li> 
       </ul> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Notifications</td> 
      <td>Select the email notifications which should be enabled for the new user.<p>You can select instant as well as daily digest notifications. All the daily digest notifications are delivered sometime after the same time for all the users selected. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure event notifications for everyone in the system</a>.</p></td>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Access</td> 
      <td> 
       <ul> 
        <li><b>Is Active:</b> Select this field to indicate whether the users are active. Active users use a Workfront license. Deselecting the field deactivates the users.</li> 
        <li> 
        <p><b>Access Level:</b> Select the access level to assign to these users. All users selected will have the same access level.
        </p> 
        <p>When you assign an access level to users, you can assign a level equal to or less than your own access level. (For example, if your access level is Planner, you cannot assign the Administrator access level.) </p>
        <p>However, you cannot assign an access level that is lower than your own if the Workfront administrator has enabled permissions on the access level that are not also enabled in your own (via the Fine-Tune settings, as described in <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>).</p>

         </li> 
        <li> 
        <p><b>Layout Template</b>: Choose a layout template for the users. The layout template assigned to the users will take precedence over any layout template assigned to their Home Group, Home Team or primary job role. For more information about the assignment priority of layout template, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and manage layout templates</a>.</p>

       <b>Work Time</b>: Represents the percentage of the Full Time Equivalent (FTE) time that the user is available for actual work, not including overhead. Work Time must be a decimal number up to 1, and it cannot be 0. For example, a 20% availability for actual work would be 0.2.

      The field's default is 1, indicating that a user spends their entire FTE on actual, project-related work. 

      The system uses this number to calculate the availability of the user for actual, project-related work. 

      For more information about creating schedules in Workfront, see <a href="../../set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md">Create a schedule</a>.

      Schedule exceptions and time off might also affect the user capacity. 

      Workfront calculates a user's availability depending on the Resource Management preferences in your Setup area. For more information, see <a href="../../set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md">Configure Resource Management preferences</a>. 

      <b>TIP</b>

      Set the Work Time value to  1 to indicate that the user is available for project-related work their entire full-time equivalent.
      </li> 

      <li><b>Schedule Deactivation</b>: Check this box if you want to schedule users to be deactivated after a period of time.</li> 
       <li><b>Scheduled Deactivation Date</b>: The date after which the users become deactivated. For more information about scheduling users for deactivation, see the section <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/deactivate-a-user.md#scheduling-users-for-deactivation" class="MCXref xref">Schedule users for deactivation</a> in <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/deactivate-a-user.md" class="MCXref xref">Deactivate or reactivate a user</a>.</li> 
       <li> <p><b>Primary Role</b>: This is the primary job role that a user has in Workfront. Every task and issue that the users are assigned to is also assigned to this job role, by default. Job roles are essential in resource management. For more information about job roles, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/create-manage-job-roles.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and manage job roles</a></p> <p>You can update this field only if you have a Plan license with administrative user access, or if you are a Workfront administrator.

       <li>(Conditional) If you selected a <b>Primary Role</b>, the <b>Percentage of FTE Availability</b> field displays. Specify what percentage of time of the users' schedules is allocated to this job role. The default value for the Percentage of FTE Availability for the Primary Role is 100%.</li> 
       <li> <p><b>Other Roles</b>: Users can have multiple job roles in Workfront. Job roles are essential in resource management. There is no limit for how many job roles a user can fulfill. However, we recommend to not assign one user to an excessively large number of job roles, because resource management might become too complex for these users.</p> <p>For more information about job roles, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/create-manage-job-roles.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and manage job roles</a>.</p> <p>You can update this field only if you have a Plan license with administrative user access, or if you are a Workfront administrator.

       <li> <p>(Conditional) If you selected one or multiple <b>Other Roles</b>, the <b>Percentage of FTE Availability</b> field displays for each role. Specify what percentage of time of the users' schedules is allocated to each job role. The default value for the Percentage of FTE Availability for the Other Roles is 0%.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>:  
       <ul> 
       <li>If Other Roles have a 0% FTE Availability, they do not display in the Resource Planner, unless the users are assigned to tasks in these roles.</li> 
       <li> <p>The sum of all Percentages of FTE Availability for all roles must equal 100%. Each Percentage of FTE Availability calculates the Available Hours for each role per user in the Resource Planner. The Available Hours for each role per user depends on the available time for the user.</p> <p>The available time for the user is calculated by Workfront depending on the method that has been selected by the Workfront administrator to calculate the FTE in the Resource Management Preferences.</p> <p>For more information about calculating availability for the user, see <a href="../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/calculate-hours-fte-for-users-roles-resource-planner.md" class="MCXref xref">Overview of calculating hours and FTE for users and roles in the Resource Planner</a>.</p> <p>For more information about configuring Resource Management preferences, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure Resource Management preferences</a>.</p> </li> 
       </ul> </p> </li> 
       <li> <p><b>Schedule</b>: Associate a schedule with the users. The schedule of the users calculates the timeline of the tasks the users are assigned to.</p> <p>A Workfront administrator or a group administrator must create a schedule before it can be associated with users.</p> <p>Select a system-level or a group schedule to assign it to the selected users.</p> <p>For more information about system-level and group schedules, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md" class="MCXref xref">Create a schedule</a>.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Workfront uses the schedule of a user only when the Calculate Resource Availability Using setting is set to The User's Schedule. For information about how the Calculate Resource Availability Using setting affects which schedule is used for Resource Management, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure Resource Management preferences</a>.</p> </li> 
       <li> <p><b>Timesheet Profile</b>: Associate a Timesheet Profile with the users. This ensures that timesheets generate automatically for the users.</p> 
       <p><b>NOTE</b>:  
       <ul> 
       <li>The list of timesheet profiles you have available in this field depends on your access:
       <ul>
       <li>As a Workfront administrator, you can see all system-level and group-level timesheet profiles.</li>
       <li><p>As a group administrator, you can see system-level timesheet profiles, as well as those associated with the groups that you manage.</p></li>
       <li><p>As a user with a Planner license and access to edit users, you can see only system-level timesheet profiles.</p></li>
       </ul></li> 
       <li>If you are a group administrator, all of the users you are editing must be members of a group that you administer.</li> 
       </ul> </p> </li> 
       <li><b>Default Hour Type</b>: Select the default hour type for the users. This is the hour type that is used by default when the users log time.</li> 
       <li> <p><b>Available Hour Types</b>: Select the hour types that should be available to the user. These hour types are visible everywhere in Workfront where the users can log time. A user can only see the hour types that are enabled at the project level as well as the user level.</p> 
       <p>For more information about what hour types are available to users, see <a href="../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/define-hour-types-and-availability.md" class="MCXref xref">Define hour types and availability</a>.</p> 
       </li> 
       <li> <b>FTE</b>: This is the Full Time Equivalent of the user. Workfront uses this number to calculate the availability of the user based on the Default Schedule only when the Resource Management Preferences at the system level are set to The Default Schedule. 

      <p>The FTE indicates the amount of time that the user can spend at work. This includes overhead, as well as time spent on project work. For example, time that is spent in meetings, or training is also included in the FTE.</p> 

      The FTE must be a decimal number up to 1, and it cannot be 0. For example, if the FTE value is 0.5 and the Default Schedule in Workfront is 40 hours, the user is available for 20 hours a week. 

      The field's default is 1.

      Schedule exceptions, time off might, and the value of Work Time may affect the availability of the user. 

      Workfront calculates a user's availability depending on the Resource Management preferences in your Setup area.

      If the Resource Management Preferences at the system level are set to The User's Schedule, the value you specify here is ignored and the user is considered to be available according to what is specified in their schedule.

       <li><b>Billing Per Hour</b>: The amount of billing per hour for the user.</li> 
       <li><b>Custom Forms</b>: Associate an existing user custom form with the users. You must create a custom form before you can associate it with a user. Only active custom forms display in the list.
