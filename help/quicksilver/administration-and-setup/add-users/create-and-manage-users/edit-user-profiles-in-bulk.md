# Edit user profiles in bulk

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that have not yet been onboarded to the Admin Console. If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, you must perform this action through the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>For instructions on editing a user's profile in the Adobe Admin Console, see the section "Edit user details" in the article [Bulk Upload Users](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/bulk-upload-users.html) or contact your Adobe Admin Console Administrator.
>
>For a list of procedures that differ based on whether your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

You can edit user accounts in bulk. When bulk editing users, only the fields you specifically select are updated with the same information for all users selected. All other fields that you leave unselected stay the same for each individual user, even if they are different for each user.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* You cannot bulk edit the Personal Info section of the users' profiles because that information must be unique for every user.
>* To ensure accuracy of data and optimal performance, we recommend that you select no more than 2000 users at one time for a bulk edit.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

## Edit user accounts in bulk

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Users** ![](assets/users-icon-in-main-menu.png). 

1. Select more than one user, then click the Edit icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png).

1. In the **Edit User** box that appears, change any of the following options:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Preferences</td> 
      <td> 
       <ul> 
        <li><b>Time Zone:</b> The users' time zone.</li> 
        <li><b>Locale</b>: The users' preferred locale. This affects the format of numbers and dates in the emails that come from Workfront.</li> 
        <li><b>Show percent complete on update status</b>: Check this option if you want to display a percent complete bar inside the update stream of tasks for all users.</li> 
        <li><b>Send work I assign to myself to my Working On tab</b>: Check this option if you want everything that the users assign to themselves to appear directly on their Working On tab. The default is to list everything assigned to a user on their Work Request tab.</li> 
       </ul> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Notifications</td> 
      <td>Select the email notifications which should be enabled for the new user.<p>You can select instant as well as daily digest notifications. All the daily digest notifications are delivered sometime after the same time for all the users selected.

        <li> 
        <p><b>Access Level:</b> Select the access level to assign to these users. All users selected will have the same access level.
        </p> 
        <p>When you assign an access level to users, you can assign a level equal to or less than your own access level. (For example, if your access level is Planner, you cannot assign the Administrator access level.) However, you cannot assign an access level that by default is less than your own access level if the Workfront administrator has enabled non-default permissions on the access level that are not also enabled in your own access level (via the Fine-Tune settings, as described in <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>).</p>

        <li> <p><b>Available Hour Types</b>: Select the hour types that should be available to the user. These hour types are visible everywhere in Workfront where the users can log time. A user can only see the hour types that are enabled at the project level as well as the user level.</p>

        <p>For example, if the FTE value is 0.5 and the Default Schedule is 40 hours, the user is available to work for 20 hours a week.

        <p>If the Resource Management Preferences at the system level are set to <b>The User's Schedule</b>, the value you specify here is ignored and the user is considered to be available according to what is specified in their schedule. In this case, the FTE of the user for the Resource Planner is calculated by the following formula:</p>
