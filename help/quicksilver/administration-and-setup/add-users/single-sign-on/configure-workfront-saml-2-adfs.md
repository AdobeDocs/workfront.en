# Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 2.0 using ADFS

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that are not yet onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can integrate Workfront with a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 solution for single sign-on while using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).

This guide focuses on setting up ADFS without auto provisioning or attribute mappings. We recommend that you complete the setup and test it prior to setting up any auto provisioning.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This is not available if your organizationâ€™s Workfront instance is enabled with Adobe IMS. See your network or IT administrator if you need more information.

## About updating users for SSO

Following this guide, the **SSO Username** will be their **Active Directory Username**.

As a Workfront administrator, you can bulk update users for SSO. For more information about updating users for SSO, see [Update users for single sign-on](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/update-users-sso.md).

As a Workfront administrator, you can also manually assign a Federation ID editing the user's profile and completing the Federation ID field. For more information about editing a user, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When editing users' profiles to include a Federation ID, selecting **Only Allow SAML 2.0 Authentication** removes the ability to log in to Workfront using the bypass url (`<yourdomain>`.my.workfront.com/login).
