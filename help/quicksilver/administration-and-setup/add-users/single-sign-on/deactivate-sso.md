# Deactivate single sign-on in Adobe Workfront

{{important-admin-console-onboard}}

<!--REMOVE ME MARCH 2026-->

<!--After you deactivate single sign-on (SSO) in Adobe Workfront, users need to log in using their Workfront credentials. These are the credentials the user originally set up. (If you need to change user credentials, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).)
