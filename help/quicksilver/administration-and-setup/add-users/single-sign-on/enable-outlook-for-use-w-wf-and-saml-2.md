## Enable Outlook for use with Workfront and SAML 2.0

1. Click **Setup** near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.
1. Click **System** > **Preferences**.

1. In the **Security** section, make sure that **Allow SAML 2.0 authentication in Office 365 add-ins**is enabled.

   This option enables embedding of Workfront in an Iframe only for Office 365 add-ins. This does not open a click-jacking breach as there is no clickable content involved.

   This option is enabled by default.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you enable **Allow embedding of Workfront in an iframe**, the **Allow SAML 2.0 authentication in Office 365 add-ins** is dimmed and enabled.
