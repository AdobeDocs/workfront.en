For information, see the section [](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md#sharing-an-object) in the article [Overview of sharing permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).
