# List your users' access levels and licenses

You can see which access level and license is assigned to each user in a user list or report.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can also group the list by license types, or filter it by a specific license.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access to users. For more information about access to viewing users, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-other-users.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to users</a>.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## List your users' access levels and licenses

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click**Users**.

   By default, all users who are set as Active display in the list.

1. In the **View** drop-down menu, select **Licenses**.

   The License column displays the name of the license assigned to each user.

1. In the **Grouping** drop-down menu, click **License Type**.

   This view groups together the users who have the same license types.

1. (Optional) To filter the list by a specific license:

   1. Click the **Filter** drop-down menu, then click **New Filter**.
   
   1. Click **Add a Filter Rule**.
   1. Start typing **License** and select it when it appears in the list.
   1. With the **Equal** modifier selected, start typing the name of the license you want to filter the list by.

      You can specify more than one license type.
   
   1. Click **Save Filter**.

      The list displays only the users associated with the license types that you specified in the filter.
