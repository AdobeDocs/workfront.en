## List your users' access levels and licenses

{{step-1-to-users}}

   By default, all users who are set as Active display in the list.

1. In the **View** drop-down menu, select **Licenses**.

   The License column displays the name of the license assigned to each user.

1. In the **Grouping** drop-down menu, click **License Type**.

   This view groups together the users who have the same license types.

1. (Optional) To filter the list by a specific license:

   1. Click the **Filter** drop-down menu, then click **New Filter**.
   
   1. Click **Add a Filter Rule**.
   1. Start typing **License** and select it when it appears in the list.
   1. With the **Equal** modifier selected, start typing the name of the license you want to filter the list by.

      You can specify more than one license type.
   
   1. Click **Save Filter**.

      The list displays only the users associated with the license types that you specified in the filter.
      
   >[!TIP]

   >You can also group the list by license types, or filter it by a specific license.
