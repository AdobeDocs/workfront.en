# Access levels overview

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you assign an access level to a user for 2 purposes:

* Every user must have an access level in order to log in and work in Workfront. 
* You use the access level to control what a user can see and do with certain Workfront objects and areas.

Each of the six built-in access levels is attached to one of the five Workfront licenses: Plan, Work, Review, Request, and Externall. (External is an unpaid license designed primarily for sharing documents with collaborators who don't use Workfront.)
