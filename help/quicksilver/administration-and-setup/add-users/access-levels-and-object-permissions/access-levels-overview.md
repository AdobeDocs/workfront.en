# Access levels overview

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you assign an access level to a user for two purposes:

* Each user must have an access level in order to log in and work in Workfront. 
* Access levels control what a user can see and do with certain Workfront objects and areas.

Each of the six built-in access levels is attached to one of the five Workfront licenses: Plan, Work, Review, Request, and External. (External is an unpaid license designed primarily for sharing documents with collaborators who don't use Workfront.)
