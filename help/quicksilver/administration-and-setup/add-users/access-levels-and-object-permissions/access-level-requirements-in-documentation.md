# Access requirements in Workfront documentation

Workfront documentation how-to articles contain a table that explains the access and permissions requirements needed for that procedure. This Access requirements table allows you to understand whether you can perform a certain action in Workfront, or why you might not be able to. This article explains each element of the Access requirements table, and provides troubleshooting tips and links to more in-depth information.

If a row is absent from the Access requirements table in a given article, there are no requirements of that type for that action.

Some rows contain information labeled "New" and "Current." This is because Workfront is transitioning to a new pricing and packaging model, with some organizations operating under the new model and others still using the current model. To find out which model your organization uses, contact your Workfront administrator. You can find details and links to information in the [The Access requirements table](#the-access-requirements-table) section of this article. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you have questions about how any of the fields in this table apply to you, contact your Workfront administrator.
