# Copy and submit requests

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE:&nbsp;this is NWE only - hard code it in classic articles!)</p>
-->

When you submit similar requests frequently you can copy an existing submitted request. In this case, you can copy an existing request, make minimal changes to it, and resubmit it as a new request.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Issues</p> <p><b>NOTE</b> 
   
   If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Access to add requests to a request queue</p> <p>View or higher permissions on the existing request</p> <p>For information on setting up a request queue, see <a href="../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md" class="MCXref xref">Create a Request Queue</a>. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have a request that you or someone in your organization previously submitted to be able to copy it and resubmit it. If the request belongs to someone else, you must have at least access to View it to be able to copy and submit it as new.

## Considerations about copying and submitting requests as new

* You can only copy and submit submitted requests. You cannot copy drafted requests.
* You can copy and submit requests you originally submitted, or requests that others submitted and you have access to at least&nbsp;View.
* You always have access to copy and submit a copy of your own requests, unless someone removed your permissions to them.
* The access to copy and submit requests originally submitted by others might be granted automatically to people in the same company when the creator of the request queue enables the **People from the same company will inherit the same permissions for all requests** in the Queue Details or Edit Project areas. Disabling this setting allows only the original requestor to view their own requests.

  For more information, see the following articles:

   * [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md) 
   * [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md)

* You can update the copy of the original request before resubmitting it as a new request.
* If the following changes occur after the original request is submitted, you can no longer copy it and resubmit it:

   * The request queue was deleted.
   * The queue topic was deleted.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >If the queue topic was the only one in the request queue, you can still copy and submit the request and it will be saved under the request queue itself.

   * The request queue is no longer published as a Help Request Queue. For information, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).
   * If the request queue has no queue topic and the original request was submitted before January 2022.

   * The Status of the project associated with the request queue is no longer Current.

* You can copy and submit a copy of a converted request if the request was preserved in the conversion process. For more information, see [Overview of converting issues in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/issues/convert-issues/convert-issues.md).

  >[!TIP]

  >The copied request is not linked to a resolving object.

## Copy and submit requests

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Requests**.
1. (Conditional) If the Submitted section does not display by default, click **Submitted** in the left panel.
1. Locate the request that you want to copy and submit as new, and do one of the following:

   * Select it, then click the **Copy and submit as new** icon ![](assets/copy-and-submit-as-new-requests-area-nwe.png) in the upper-left corner of the Submitted requests list.
   * Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-icon.png) to the right of the request name, then click&nbsp;**Copy and submit as new**

     Or

     Right-click on the selected request, then click **Copy and submit as new**.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >When you do not have access to create issues, you receive a warning that your administrator restricted you from creating requests.

1. (Optional) Update the following information, if needed:

   * **Request Type**: the request queue where the copied request is saved. By default, the copied request is saved to the request queue of the original request.
   * **Topic Groups** and **Queue&nbsp;Topics**, if they are selected. The names or topic groups and queue topics are customized for your environment. By default, the copied request is saved to the topic groups and the queue topics of the original request.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >If the path changes from the path of the original request, then the creator of the request queue modified the queue.

1. (Optional) Update any information from the copied request. Depending on what fields the request queue creator enabled in the **New Issue Fields** section of the **Queue Details**&nbsp;subtab on the project, you might find&nbsp;any of the following fields:

   <table style="table-layout:auto">

      <td role="rowheader"><strong>Subject</strong> </td>
