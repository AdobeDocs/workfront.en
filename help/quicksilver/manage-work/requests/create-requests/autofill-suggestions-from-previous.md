AI can help you auto-fill request fields based on previous requests. You can approve or reject these suggestions before submitting the request. 

Auto-fill does not overwrite any fields that you have already filled in.

Users do not receive suggestions of data that they do not otherwise have access to.

## Get suggestions when filling out form 

Auto-fill can suggest field values while you are filling out the form. As you enter values into the request fields, Workfront compares those values with previous requests. If the entered value closely correlates with other field values in similar contexts in previous requests, Workfront suggests those values.

For example, if a clinic always uses the same billing code, Workfront would suggest that billing code in the appropriate field when the clinic name is entered.

To use suggestions based on previous requests:

1. Begin creating a request.

   For instructions, see [Create and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).

1. Begin filling in fields.

   As you fill in fields, other fields may show suggestions.

1. For each field suggestion, select **Accept** or **Reject** below that field.

   Or

   Select **Accept all** or **Reject all** at the top of the page to accept or reject all suggestions.
