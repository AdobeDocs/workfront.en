# Create requests from drafts

In addition to using the available drafts that Workfront suggests to you when you enter a new request, you can also access a draft request from the Drafts section and finish submitting it from there.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites for creating requests from drafts

You must do the following before you can create a request from a draft:&nbsp;

* Start creating a request. This saves the request as a draft automatically in the Drafts section.

  For information about creating requests, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).

## Create requests from drafts

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront.
1. Click&nbsp;**Requests** > **Drafts**.

   A draft for each queue topic of each request queue displays in this list.

   ![](assets/nwe-drafts-section-with-list-of-drafts-350x169.png)

1. Review the information about each draft in the following columns of the Drafts list:

   | Subject |This is the name you gave your request as you started to create it.  |
   |---|---|
   | Path |The name of the request queue, topic groups, and queue topics where you originally intended to submit the request. |
   | Entry Date |The date when you initiated creating the request. |
   | Last Update Date |The last of your last update. If you did not update it since you first started the request the&nbsp;Entry Date and the Last Update Date should be the same.  |

1. (Optional) Click **Filter by request type** in the upper-right corner of the list of drafts, then select the request queue that contains the drafts you want to display. 
1. Click the name of a draft to open it. 
1. Update the information for the request as described in [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).
1. (Optional and conditional) At any point during entering the request, click **Discard** ```draft``` if you want to delete the draft. This deletes the draft which cannot be recovered. For more information about deleting drafts, see [Delete a request draft](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/delete-request-draft.md). 

1. (Optional) Click **Cancel** in the lower-left corner of the page if you want to revert your action and keep the ```draft.```

1. After completing the information for the request, do one of the following:

   * Click ```**Submit**``` if you are ready to submit the request. The request is saved in the Submitted section. Depending on the Routing Rule of the Request Queue, this request might be routed to a different project than the one designated&nbsp;as a Request Queue. For information about routing rules, see [Create Routing Rules](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-routing-rules.md).

     Or

     C ```lick **Close** if you are not quite ready to submit it and you might come back and finish it later.``` Your request is saved in the Drafts section  and it will be available to you next time you submit a request for this request queue.

     When you submit the request, the draft is deleted and cannot be restored.
