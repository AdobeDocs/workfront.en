# Convert an issue to a project

<!--Audited: 08/2025-->

If more work needs to be done to complete an issue after the issue is submitted, you can convert the issue to a project.

You can convert an issue to a project with our without using a project template. This article describes both ways for converting issues to projects.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>For general information about converting issues, we recommend that you also read the article [Overview of converting issues in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/issues/convert-issues/convert-issues.md).

When creating a project from an issue, some of the fields on the project populate from other objects. For more information, see the "New project default settings" section in the article [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).

## Considerations

* There is a 5-minute processing limit when converting an issue to a project. If the issue has a large number of documents attached to it and fails to convert, you might need to remove some of the documents and try again.

## Convert an issue to a project

You can convert an issue to a blank project. 

1. Go to a project and click **[!UICONTROL Issues]** in the left panel. 
1. In the list of issues that displays, do one of the following:

   * To convert an issue to a blank project, click the name of the issue, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon.png) to the right of the issue name, then click **[!UICONTROL Convert to a blank project]**.

        
     Or   
      
     Select the issue in the list of issue, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon.png) at the top of the list, then click **[!UICONTROL Convert to a blank project]**. 

      >[!IMPORTANT]
      >
      >The Convert to a blank project option displays only when your system or group administrator enabled the [!UICONTROL Allow users to create projects without using a template] preference in the [!UICONTROL Setup] area. For more information, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).


     You must manually add tasks to the project or attach a template to the project after you convert the issue.
     
     >[!TIP]
     >   
     >* If the issue was created using a request queue, the new project inherits the request queue's Group. 
     >* If the issue was created by adding it to the Issues section of the project, the new project inherits the Group of the issue's project.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >If the issue is associated with an approval process or it is already associated with a resolving object, Workfront displays a warning at the top of the Convert to Project box to notify you that the approval will be removed or the resolving object will be overwritten during the conversion. For more information, see [Overview of converting issues in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/issues/convert-issues/convert-issues.md).

1. (Optional and conditional) Click [!UICONTROL **Options**] in the left panel, then select from the options that are available:

      * [!UICONTROL **Keep the original issue and tie its resolution to this project**]

        When deselected, the original issue is deleted.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >Users without access or permissions to delete issues will not be able to delete the issue as they are converting it, regardless of the status of this setting. For information about access and permissions to issues, see:
        >
        >* [Grant access to issues](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-issues.md)
        > 
        >* [Share an issue](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-an-issue.md) 

      * [!UICONTROL **Allow (User Name) to have access to this project**]

        If unselected, the issue's [!UICONTROL Primary Contact] has no access to the new task.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >The options that are available here depend on how the Workfront administrator has configured them for everyone in the system or for your group. For more information, see [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).
        >
        >
        >Or, if the top-level groups in your organization configured them separately, the options available here depend on which group you selected for the new project in step 6. For more information, see [Configure task and issue preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-task-issue-preferences-group.md).

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Custom Forms**] and do any of the following:

   * Review the custom forms attached to the issue. They will transfer to the new project, if they are also project custom forms.
   * Add more custom forms
   * Ensure all required fields have valid information. 
   * Rearrange the custom forms by dragging them ![Drag icon](assets/drag-object-icon.png) where you want them. 
   * Click the **x** icon to the right of any form that you do not want to transfer to the project. This removes the form from the project. 
   * If necessary, transfer custom form information from the issue to the project.

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >* If a multi-object custom form attached to the issue is configured for use with both issues and projects, all information saved in the form is retained when you make the conversion if the fields exist both on the issue as well as the project's custom forms.
      >* If a multi-object custom form with a calculated field is attached to the issue as well as to the project, the issue and the project must be compatible with all fields referenced in the form's calculated custom fields. If there is an incompatibility, a message alerts you to make adjustments. For more information, see the "Calculated custom fields in multi-object custom forms" section in the [Add calculated fields to a form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/add-a-calculated-field.md). 

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Convert to project**].

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >If you decided to delete the original issue, the issue is now a project.
      >   
      >Or
      >  
      >If you decided to keep the original issue, the issue is now linked to the new project and it will complete when the project completes. 
      >
      >Information in some issue fields transfer to the project, if you did not change them during conversion. 

1. (Optional) Set any further project details â€‹(project owner, project dates) and tasks as necessary.
1. Click [!UICONTROL **Convert to project**].

   The issue is now converted to a project. The project page displays. 

## Convert an issue to a project using a template

     >* If the issue was created using a request queue, the new project inherits the request queue's Group. 
     >* If the issue was created by adding it to the Issues section of the project, the new project inherits the Group of the issue's project.

1. Review template details on the right.

   The template details include the following:

   * Template duration
   * Template owner

1. If a field is already populated in the template, the field is pre-populated in the [!UICONTROL Convert to project] box. You can edit the pre-populated values to better match your project. For more information, see [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >* Your system or group administrator can add or remove fields in the [!UICONTROL Convert to Project box] by updating the Project Details information in your [!UICONTROL Layout Template]. 
   >
   >* To update fields in the [!UICONTROL Finance] section in the [!UICONTROL Convert to Project] box you must have [!UICONTROL Edit] access to [!UICONTROL Financial Data] in your access level. If you have [!UICONTROL View] access to [!UICONTROL Financial Data] in your access level all financial information from the template transfers to the new project and you cannot edit it while you convert the issue. For information, see [Grant access to financial data](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-financial.md) and [Share a template](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-template.md).
