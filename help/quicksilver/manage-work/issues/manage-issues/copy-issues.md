# Copy issues

You can copy an issue or a request and save them on the same or another project. You can also copy an issue from a task to another project.

You can copy issues from the following objects:

* From a project to the same project (duplicate it on the same project)
* From a task to the same task (duplicate if on the same task)
* From a project to another project
* From a task to a project

>[!TIP]
>
>"Issues" and "requests" are used interchangeably in Workfront. You can record issues on both projects and tasks to indicate unforeseen work that needs to be addressed. You can also submit requests which are recorded as issues on a project designated as a Request Queue.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> <p>Review or higher license to copy an issue in the Issues section of a project.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Issues</p> <p>View or higher access to Projects and Tasks</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information about access to issues in your Access Level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-issues.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to issues</a>. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to the issue</p> <p>Contribute permissions to the item where you are copying&nbsp;the issue to with the ability to&nbsp;Add Issues.</p> <p> For information about granting permissions to issues, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-an-issue.md" class="MCXref xref">Share an issue </a></p> <p>For information on requesting additional permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Considerations for issues associated with documents or request queues

Consider the following when copying issues that contain documents or are associated with a request queue:

* **When an issue is associated with a request queue:** When you copy&nbsp;an issue to another object&nbsp;and the issue&nbsp;is associated with a request queue, the copied issue is no longer associated with the original queue&nbsp;the first issue originated from.
* **When a document is attached to the issue:**&nbsp;When you copy&nbsp;an issue to another object&nbsp;and the issue has a document attached to it, the document and its versions also move to the new&nbsp;issue. Any proofs or approvals associated with the document do&nbsp;not move.
* **When an issue is linked to a document or a folder:**&nbsp;When you copy an issue which has documents or folders linked to a third party service like Google Drive, the&nbsp;links to the documents transfer to the copied issue.&nbsp;

## Copy issues in a list

You can copy one or multiple issues from a list of issues or from an issue report.

1. Go to the project that contains the issue or issues that you want to copy.

   Or

   Go to an issue report. 

1. If you selected to go to a project, click **Issues** in the left panel. 
1. Select the issue or issues that you want to copy and click the **More menu** at the top of the issue list, then click **Copy to**.

   >Similar messages display if the project selected is in pending approval, completed, or dead, when the Workfront administrator prevents adding issues to these projects.&nbsp;For more information, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).
