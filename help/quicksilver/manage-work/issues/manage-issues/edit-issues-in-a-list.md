## Inline edit issues

You can edit issue information in a list of issues, by inline editing fields displayed in the view of the list.

Consider the following when editing issues in a list:

* You can edit any issue field that displays in the list and that you have permissions to update.
* You can edit an issue in the following lists:

   * The Issues section of a project or of a task
   * An issue report

To inline edit an issue:

1. Go to a list of issues in a project or task. 
1. Click inside any field that you have permissions to update manually. The field becomes editable and you can make your changes.

   ![Edit issues inline](assets/edit-issues-inline-350x34.png)

1. Press enter when you want to accept your changes. Changes are saved immediately.

   For information about inline editing objects, see [Inline edit items in a list in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/inline-edit-objects.md).

## Edit issues from a list

1. Go to a list of issues in a project or task. 
1. Do one of the following

   * Select the issue in the list, then click **Edit** icon ![Edit icon](assets/qs-edit-icon.png) in the toolbar. 
   * Click the name of the issue, then click **Edit**.

     Any of these actions opens the **Edit Issue** box.

     For information about editing issues in the **Edit Issue** box, see [Edit issues](../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/edit-issues.md).

## Edit issues using the Summary

You can edit an issue in a list using the Summary panel.

1. Go to the project whose issues you want to edit.
1. Click **Issues** in the left panel.

   The list of issues on the project displays. 

1. Select an issue that you want to edit, then click the **Open summary** icon ![Open summary icon](assets/qs-open-summary-icon-in-new-toolbar-small.png) in the upper-right corner of the issue list.

   The **Summary** opens.

1. (Optional) Start typing an update for the issue in the **Updates** area. 
1. Click any of the following icons or areas to go to the issue and edit information at the issue level:

   | Icon  |Action |
   |---|---|
   | Documents ![Documents icon](assets/documents-icon-in-summary.png) |Click **Click here to add** to add documents to the issue. |
   | Details ![Details icon](assets/details-icon-in-summary.png) |Click to update information about the issue. |
   | Hours ![Log time](assets/log-time-icon-in-summary.png)  |Click to log hours. |
   | Approvals ![Approvals icon](assets/approvals-icon-in-summary.png)  |Click to add issue approvals.  |

1. (Optional) Click the **Open Summary** icon again, or the **X icon** in the upper-right of the Summary to close the panel and edit the issue inline.

## Edit issues in bulk

You can edit issues in bulk and update all their information at the same time.

To edit issues in bulk:

1. Go to the **Main Menu**. 
1. Click **Projects**.  
1. Click a project name to access the project.
1. Click **Issues** in the left panel.  
1. Select several issues in the list. 
1. Click the **Edit** icon ![Edit icon](assets/edit-icon.png).

   The **Edit Issues** dialog box opens.

1. Specify the information on all selected issues.

   Editing the information on all issues is identical to editing information on one issue when editing the following areas:

   <div class="preview">

   * Overview
   * Assignments
   * Custom Forms 
   * Settings
   * Comment

   </div>
      
   For more information about editing an issue, see [Edit issues](../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/edit-issues.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The information you are changing on all the issues selected will override the existing information on individual issues, except for the **Assignments** field. Adding a new assignee in bulk edit will add that assignee to all the selected issues. If other assignees are assigned to the selected issues, they will remain assigned in addition to the one added through bulk edit.

1. Click **Custom Forms** to edit the custom forms attached to all the issues selected.

   If the issues selected do not have any common custom forms, no forms are listed in this section.

   You can edit only the fields on the forms that are attached to all issues selected and which you have permissions to edit.

1. (Optional and conditional) Depending what environment you use to edit the issues, do one of the following to recalculate custom expressions for all issues:

   1. In the Production environment, in the **Custom Forms** area, select the **Recalculate Custom Expressions** option to ensure that all Calculated Custom Fields that are on the Custom Forms attached to the issues selected are up to date.
 
   1. <span class="preview">In the Preview environment, with all the issues selected in the list, click the **More** menu ![More menu](assets/more-icon.png) at the top of the issue list, then click **Recalculate Expressions**. </span>   

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >We recommend not to select more than 500 issues at a time when you recalculate custom expressions.

1. Click **Save Changes**.

   All changes you made are now visible on all the selected issues.
