# Update issue severity

<!--Audited: 08/2025-->

You can associate a severity with issues in Adobe Workfront. Tasks and projects do not have severities.

Issues are unexpected events that can prevent your projects from finishing on time or within budget. You can use severities to indicate how serious an issue is. 

Your Workfront administrator defines the severities available in Workfront. After they establish them, they are available for you to associate with an issue.  
For more information about creating severities in Workfront, see [Create or customize issue severities](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-customize-issue-severities.md).

You must have Contribute permissions on an issue to be able to update its severity. 

You can update the severity of issues in the following areas of Workfront:

* In the **Edit Issue** dialog box
* In the **Issue Details** area of an issue  
* In an issue list or report
