# Issue Duration overview

The Duration of an issue is the number of days between the Planned Start Date and the Planned Completion Date of the issue.&nbsp;

The duration of an issue is automatically calculated by Adobe Workfront and it cannot be manually modified.&nbsp;

You can display the Duration of an issue in an issue report or the view of a list of issues.&nbsp;

For more information about building a report, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).
