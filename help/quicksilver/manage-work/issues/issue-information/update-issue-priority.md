You can define a priority for an issue&nbsp; to indicate how important the issue is.

You must have Manage permissions to the issue to modify the Priority of the issue.&nbsp; [Update the Priority of an issue](#update-the-priority-of-an-issue).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to the issue</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td>

 </tbody>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Overview of issue Priorities

Each priority label&nbsp;has a number associated with it that can not be modified.

Adobe Workfront administrators can&nbsp;modify priority labels within Workfront or they can create new priorities. As a result, the options you might have for the Priority field in your Workfront instance might&nbsp;differ from those listed below.

You should become familiar with the numbering sequence for priorities used in your&nbsp;organization.   
For example, your organization might&nbsp;use the number 1 to refer to urgent tasks, if the label of the priority has been modified.

For more information about customizing the names of priorities in your instance, see [Create and customize priorities](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-customize-priorities.md).

Refer to the following table to understand each&nbsp;default priority label and its corresponding number: 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Priority Label <br>(Can be modified) </th> 
   <th>Priority Number <br>(Cannot be modified) </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> None </td> 
   <td> 0 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Low </td> 
   <td> 1 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Normal </td> 
   <td> 2 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> High </td> 
   <td> 3 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Urgent </td> 
   <td> 4 </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
