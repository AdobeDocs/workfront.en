## Overview of issue Priorities

Each priority label has a number associated with it that can not be modified.

Adobe Workfront administrators can modify priority labels within Workfront or they can create new priorities. As a result, the options you might have for the Priority field in your Workfront instance might differ from those listed below.

You should become familiar with the numbering sequence for priorities used in your organization.   
For example, your organization might use the number 1 to refer to urgent tasks, if the label of the priority has been modified.

For more information about customizing the names of priorities in your instance, see [Create and customize priorities](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-customize-priorities.md).

Refer to the following table to understand each default priority label and its corresponding number: 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Priority Label <br>(Can be modified) </th> 
   <th>Priority Number <br>(Cannot be modified) </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> None </td> 
   <td> 0 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Low </td> 
   <td> 1 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Normal </td> 
   <td> 2 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> High </td> 
   <td> 3 </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Urgent </td> 
   <td> 4 </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>
