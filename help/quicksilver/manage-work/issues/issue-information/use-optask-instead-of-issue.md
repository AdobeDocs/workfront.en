# Use "opTask" and "issue" when referencing issues

The name of an issue appears as `opTask` in the Adobe Workfront database. Although there are times when you need to use the `issue` field name to refer to issues, most of the time you must use the `opTask` field name instead of `issue` when referencing issues.

For more information about how objects appear in the Workfront database, refer to the [API Explorer](https://one.workfront.com/s/api-explorer).

## `opTask` filename

Use the `opTask` field name when referencing issues in the following contexts:

* When you create a text mode custom report for issues, and you want to reference issues in views, filters, groupings, or prompts.  
 
  For more information about using text mode in a report, see [Text Mode overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md).

<!--* When you pull information about issues using our API.  
  For more information about the Workfront API, see [Adobe Workfront API](../../../wf-api/workfront-api.md)-->

* When you update issue fields in a Kick-Start data importer sheet. 

  For more information about importing data in Workfront using a Kick-Start, see [Import data into Adobe Workfront using a Kick-Start template](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/using-kick-starts/import-data-via-kickstarts.md).

## `issue` field ename 

Use the `issue` field name to reference issues in the following contexts:

* When you reference issues in a collection using text mode in a report. 
* When you reference an issue collection using the Workfront API.

For information about reporting on collections, see [Reference collections in a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/reference-collections-report.md).
