# Issue information: article index

<!--Audited: 08/2025-->

While working on a project, you might discover that unexpected events arise. You can log those unexpected events as issues for a particular project or for a task. 

Unlike tasks, issues cannot drive the percent complete of a project. However, issues are work items that can prevent a project from completing. An incomplete issue indicates that there is still work to be done before a project can close. 

This section contains the following articles:

* [Issue Duration overview](../../../manage-work/issues/issue-information/issue-duration.md) 
* [Update issue Priority](../../../manage-work/issues/issue-information/update-issue-priority.md) 
* [Update issue severity](../../../manage-work/issues/issue-information/update-issue-severity.md) 
* [Overview of the issue Planned Completion Date](../../../manage-work/issues/issue-information/issue-planned-completion-date.md) 
* [Use "opTask" and "issue" when referencing issues](../../../manage-work/issues/issue-information/use-optask-instead-of-issue.md)
