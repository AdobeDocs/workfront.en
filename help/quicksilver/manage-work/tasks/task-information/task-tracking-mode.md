# Task Tracking Mode overview

You can adjust the Tracking Mode setting of a task when creating or editing a task to control how and when the Progress Status indicators of a task display. Adobe Workfront displays Progress Status flags when you configure certain settings for tracking progress on tasks.

For more information about Progress Status of tasks, see [Task Progress Status overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/task-progress-status.md).

## Tracking Mode options {#tracking-mode-options}

As a task owner or a project manager, you can select how Workfront indicates the progress status on each task. For information about how to set Tracking Mode on your tasks, see [Set Tracking Mode for tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/set-tracking-mode-for-tasks.md).

You can select from the following options:

* [User Must Update](#user-must-update) 
* [Assume On Time](#assume-on-time) 
* [Ignore Late Warnings](#ignore-late-warnings) 
* [Auto Complete](#auto-complete) 
* [Predecessor](#predecessor)

### User Must Update {#user-must-update}

When this option is selected, Workfront uses the task's Percent Complete and Actual Hours logged to determine the Progress Status of the task. This is the default option.

### Assume On Time {#assume-on-time}

Workfront assumes a task will be completed on time regardless of the current completion status. If it does not, then Workfront automatically assumes a Planned Completion Date of the next working day. You must still indicate when the task completes. Use this option when users will not be regularly updating their tasks.

### Ignore Late Warnings {#ignore-late-warnings}

The Progress Status of a task will be On Time until it becomes Late. For example, if you schedule a task to take 10 days and on the day it is to be completed the task shows a Percent Complete of 60%, then Workfront updates the Projected Completion Date by adding four days and the Progress Status of the task becomes Late.

### Auto Complete {#auto-complete}

Workfront assumes tasks will be completed as scheduled and marks them as complete on their Due or Planned Completion Dates. Until then, Workfront uses Percent Complete and Actual Hours logged to determine the Progress Status. However, regardless of the Progress Status before the scheduled completion date, Workfront still marks the task completed. In case the task has incomplete predecessors, it will not be automatically completed until all its predecessors are completed. 


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Selecting to have tasks auto complete marks the task Complete when the project time is recalculated. If the Update Type of the project is set to Automatic or Automatic and On Change, the project timeline is calculated daily. For information about timeline recalculations on projects, see [Recalculate project timelines](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/recalculate-project-timeline.md). 
>
>The time of the Actual Completion Date is midnight of the day when the timeline is automatically calculated. The time used to generate this time stamp is your system's Time&nbsp;Zone as defined by your Workfront administrator in the Customer Info section of Setup. For information about setting your system's Time Zone, see [Configure basic information for your system](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-basic-info.md).

### Predecessor {#predecessor}

Workfront estimates the Projected Completion Date of a task according to its predecessor relationship. The Progress Status of a task is determined based on this estimation. For example, Task B has a Duration of 1 Day and is scheduled to complete two days after its predecessor, Task A, which should take five days. A user then updates Task B to 50% complete, but the predecessor, Task A, has not yet started. Workfront chedules the dependent Task B for completion six days after the start date of the predecessor task, allowing 5 days for Task A and 1 day for Task B.
