# Tasks overview

<!-- Audited: 01/2024 -->

A task is a work item inside of a project. It represents a finite amount of work smaller than the project.

Tasks can be assigned to users to be completed. When all the tasks in a project are completed, the project Status can be marked Complete.

For more information about projects in Adobe Workfront, see [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).

The following are types of tasks in a project:

* Parent tasks 
* Subtasks or children tasks
* Top-level tasks
* Working tasks
* Recurring tasks

## Overview of Parent tasks  {#overview-of-parent-tasks}

You can break down a task that is larger in scope into several smaller tasks that are easier to complete. The smaller tasks become the children tasks or subtasks of the original task. The original task becomes the parent task.

Depending on what the Summary Completion Mode is on the project, you maybe be able to complete a parent task independently from its children tasks. By default, you cannot complete or update a parent task independently from its children.

For more information about the Summary Completion Mode of projects, see [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

## Overview of Subtasks or children tasks

Subtasks or children tasks are tasks listed under a parent task. They typically influence the updating and the resolution of the parent task.

For more information about parent tasks, see [Overview of Parent tasks](#overview-of-parent-tasks) in this article.

For more information about creating a child task, see [Create tasks in a project](../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-tasks-in-project.md).

## Overview of top-level tasks

Top-level tasks are a type of working tasks, which can either be a parent or a stand-alone task with no parent nor children. You can update and complete top-level tasks without influencing the update or resolution of other tasks.

## Overview of working tasks

Working tasks are tasks that do not have children or subtasks of their own, or tasks that are not listed under another parent.

This is an important distinction because it is possible for children tasks to have children tasks of their own.

You can update and complete working tasks without influencing the update or resolution of other tasks.

## Recurring tasks

If you have a task that occurs repeatedly, you can create it as a recurring task with multiple recurrences. For information about recurring tasks, see [Recurring tasks overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/recurring-tasks-overview.md).
