# Update task Leveling Delay

At times, there might be conflicts between task schedules on a project. You can level resources or address resource conflicts by rescheduling resources and tasks so that all tasks can be completed within a realistic&nbsp;schedule. For information about leveling tasks, see [Level Resources in the Gantt Chart](../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/level-resources-in-gantt.md).

As the project manager, or the task assignee, you can also add a Leveling Delay on individual tasks to account for any resource or scheduling conflicts. In other words, a task might be scheduled with a delay to ensure that when Adobe Workfront levels&nbsp;the tasks a more realistic schedule overcomes resource conflicts.

Adding a leveling delay to a task adjusts the Projected Completion Date of the task. For information about the projected completion date, see [Overview of the Projected Completion Date for projects, tasks, and issues](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-projected-completion-date.md).

## Access requirements

1. Specify the **Leveling Delay**, in hours, then choose a unit of time.  
   This is the time that the resource will be delayed starting the task due to resource conflicts.

   Select from the following options for units of time:

   * Minutes
   * Hours.&nbsp;This is the default.
   * Days
   * Weeks
   * Months
   * Elapsed Minutes
   * Elapsed Hours

   * Elapsed Weeks
   * Elapsed Months

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Elapsed time is a unit of time for a task's Duration. It is the time between the Planned Start Date and the Planned Completion Date of a task that includes holidays, weekends, and time off. In other words, elapsed time is the passage of calendar days.

1. Click **Save**.&nbsp;
