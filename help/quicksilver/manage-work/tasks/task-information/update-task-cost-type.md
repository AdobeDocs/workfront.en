# Update task&nbsp;Cost Type

The Planned and Actual Cost of the tasks and their Labor Costs are determined by the Cost Type of each task.

You can configure the Cost Type for individual tasks within the project. Each cost type affects the Planned Cost and Actual Cost values.

For information about tracking costs in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront, see [Track costs](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/track-costs.md).
