# Tasks FAQs

## Does the user who assigns tasks to other users receive notifications about changes or updates on the tasks they assign?

### Answer

By default, a task requester/ assigner does not receive email notifications for the changes on the tasks that they assign to other users. The amount of notifications on these tasks would be overwhelming for someone who assigns a large number of tasks routinely.

## Why does the New Task button not show in the Subtasks section?

The New Task button does not show in the subtask section when there is an Approval on the main task.

### Answer

The New Task button does not show because Adobe Workfront does not allow a task with an Approval to become a parent task.

## What is the Allocation Date?

### Answer

The Allocation Date is the first day (Sunday) of a week in which the allocation of a Job Role to a task starts. For information, see [Glossary of Adobe Workfront terminology](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/workfront-terminology-glossary.md).
