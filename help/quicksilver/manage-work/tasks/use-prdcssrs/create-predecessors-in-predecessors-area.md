# Create a predecessor relationship using the Predecessors area

<!-- Audited: 5/2025 -->

You can use predecessor tasks (or just predecessors) to link tasks that depend on other tasks to start or complete. For example, you wouldn't want to host a party (dependent task) before you send out the invitations (predecessor task).

This article shows how you can set predecessors using the Predecessors tab within a task.

For information about setting predecessors in a list of tasks, see [Create a predecessor relationship on the task list](../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/create-predecessors-on-task-list.md).

You can view the predecessors of tasks in the following areas of Adobe Workfront:

* In the Predecessors section of the dependent tasks
* In the Gantt Chart
* In the task list in the Predecessors column

For information about predecessors, see [Overview of task predecessors](../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/predecessors-overview.md).
