# Task Constraint overview: Earliest Available Time

Earliest Available Time is a Task Constraint that schedules a task to begin at the earliest available time after considering any predecessor relationships.

For information about how to update the Task&nbsp;Constraint on a task, see [Update the Task Constraint of a task](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-constraints/update-task-constraint-of-task.md).

## The difference between Earliest Available Time and As Soon As Possible

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: [! This section is duplicated in "Earliest Available Time"])</p>
-->

The Earliest Available Time constraint differs from the As Soon As Possible constraint when all of the following criteria exist:

* The project is scheduled From Completion 
* Tasks in the project have a predecessor relationship 
* The predecessor task has a flexible task constraint

In this situation:

* **Earliest Available Time:** Using the Earliest Available Time constraint on the successor task gives priority to the predecessor's flexible constraint.

  **Example:** Task A is a predecessor to Task B. Task B has the Earliest Available Time constraint and Task A has the As Late As Possible constraint. In this situation, Task B is scheduled as close to the completion of the project as possible.

* **As Soon As Possible:** In this scenario, using the As Soon As Possible constraint on the successor task gives the priority to the successor task.

  **Example:**  Task A is a predecessor to Task B. Task B has the As Soon As Possible constraint and Task A has the As Late As Possible constraint. In this situation, Task B is scheduled as close to the start of the project as possible.
