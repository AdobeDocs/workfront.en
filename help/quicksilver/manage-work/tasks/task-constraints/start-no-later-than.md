# Task Constraint overview: Start No Later Than

Start No Later Than (SNLT) is a Task Constraint that schedules a task to start prior to the date you specify.

Consider the following when working with the SNLT constraint:

* You should use the Start No Later Than constraint when the project is scheduled From Complete Date. In this case, you can provide a soft constraint on a task before it forces other dependent tasks to show as At Risk.
* Start No Later Than is the default constraint if a project uses a schedule mode of&nbsp;Schedule from Completion Date and system or group default for the Start&nbsp;Date of a task is Today. For information about where to set the default Constraint for a new task, refer to [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).
* When you use the SNLT constraint with a Schedule From Start Date project, Adobe Workfront schedules the task as it would an As Soon As Possible task.
* When you move or copy a task with a SNLT constraint to another project, the constraint of the task or the dates of the project might change depending on what the constraint dates are and what the Start and Completion Dates of the project are. The following scenarios exist:

   * When the destination project is scheduled From Start:

      * When the constraint date of the task is earlier than the project Planned Start Date, the task constraint changes to As Soon As Possible. 
      * When the constraint date of the task is later than the project Planned Completion Date, the project Planned Completion Date changes to match the completion constraint date of the task.

      * When the destination project is scheduled From Completion:

         * When the constraint date of the task is later than the Project Completion Date, the task constraint changes to As Late As Possible. 
         * When the constraint date of the task is earlier than the Planned Start Date of the project, the project Planned Start Date changes to match the start constraint date of the task.

      * Regardless of the schedule of the project, when the constraint date of the task is within the Start and Completion Dates of the project, there are no changes to the Task Constraint or the project dates.
