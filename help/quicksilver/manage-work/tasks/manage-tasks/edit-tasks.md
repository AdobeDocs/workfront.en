<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<p>(NOTE: some information in this area is repeated in the following articles. If you need to update a fied, update it in both:</p>

You can edit information on tasks that you have created, or that you have Contribute or Manage permissions to.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

   <td> <p>Edit access to Tasks and&nbsp;Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## Limitations for editing tasks

There are some limitations that might prevent you from editing tasks.

Consider the following when editing tasks:

* Updating tasks triggers notifications for projects that are a Current status. To avoid confusion for users who are assigned to the tasks, limit editing tasks as much as possible when the project is in the Current status. 
* You cannot edit tasks that are in an Approval Process. You can only log time or update the Status for a task in an approval process.

  ![](assets/edit-task-in-approval-process-nwe-350x148.png)

* You can edit and add documents to tasks on a project that has a status of Complete, Dead, or is Pending Approval only when your Workfront administrator ```or a group administrator``` enabled this functionality in the Project Preferences area. For information about setting project preferences, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md). 

* You can always edit the following information on a task when the project has been marked Complete, Dead, or is in an Approval Process:

   * Log time
   * Edit existing expenses
   * Attach a custom form

## Edit a task in a list

You can edit task information in a list of tasks, by inline editing fields displayed in the view of the list.

For information about editing tasks in lists, see [Edit tasks in a list](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks-in-a-list.md).

## Edit a task in a list using the Summary

You can edit a task in a list using the Summary panel. For information about editing a task in the Summary panel, see the "Edit a task in the Summary" section in the [Edit tasks in a list](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks-in-a-list.md) article.

### Assignments {#assignments}

1. Begin editing your task as described above.
1. Click&nbsp;**Assignments** in the left panel.

   ![](assets/nwe-assignments-section-edit-task-box-350x217.png)

1. Click **Search people, role and teams** and start typing the name of a user, role, or team that you want to assign to the task, then click it or press Enter when it displays on the list.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the user's name contains a special character, you must include the special character in the search field.

   You can assign multiple users or job roles to a task. You can assign only one team to a task.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can assign multiple users or job roles, and you can assign only one team. ```You can assign only active users, ```job roles```, and teams.```
   >
   >
   >```If a user, ```job role```, or a team was assigned before they were deactivated, they remain assigned to the work item. In this case, we recommend the following:``` 
   >
   >   
   >   
   >   * ```Reassign the work item to active resources.``` 
   >   * ```Associate the users in a deactivated team with an active team and reassign the work item to the active team.``` 
   >   
   >

1. (Optional) Indicate whether an assignee is the primary assignee on the task, by selecting the **Owner** radio button next to their name. A team cannot be the primary assignee of a task.

         <p>Note: Elapsed time is a unit of time for a task's Duration. It is the time between the Planned Start Date and the Planned Completion Date of a task that includes holidays, weekends, and time off. In other words, elapsed time is the passage of calendar days. Regular time takes into account holidays, weekends, and time off and excludes them from the Duration of the task.

### Custom&nbsp;Forms

You can define default custom forms to be automatically attached to tasks when the tasks are added to a project. For information about setting up the project to include default task custom forms for all new tasks, see the "Tasks"section in the article [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

1. Begin editing the task as described above.
1. Click **Custom Forms** in the left panel, or click the name of a custom form if it is already attached.

   ![](assets/nwe-custom-forms-section-edit-task-box-350x127.png)

1. Click **Add custom form** and select the custom form or forms that you want to associate with the task. You must build the custom forms before they are available to select in this field. Only active custom forms display in the list.

   For more information about building custom forms, see [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).You can add up to ten custom forms to a task.

1. (Conditional) If you attached a custom form to the task, edit any fields on the form. You must specify all required fields before you can save the task.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Depending on how your Workfront administrator set the permissions for the sections in your custom form, not everyone can view or edit the same fields on a given custom form. The permissions to edit fields within a section of a custom form depend on the permissions you have on the task itself. ```For information about setting task permissions, see [Share a task](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-task.md).```
