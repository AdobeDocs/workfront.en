# Manage task information in the Task Details Overview area

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: some of the information (fields) in this article is also in the Edit tasks article; if you need to update one field, do it in both articles)</p>
-->

You can view or edit the information of a task by accessing the Overview area of the Task&nbsp;Details  section . There is a limited number of fields that you can view or edit in this area. For information about editing all information for a task see [Edit tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks.md).

This article describes how to view or edit information in the Overview area of Task Details. For information about updating other areas of Task Details , see the following articles:

* [Manage task finances in the Task Details section](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/task-finances-in-details.md) 
* [Add a custom form to an object](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/add-a-custom-form-to-an-object.md) 
* [Manage custom forms attached to objects](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/manage-custom-forms-attached-to-objects.md)

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <caption style="text-align: left;">
   *To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Edit task information in the Task Details Overview section

1. Go to a task that you want to view or edit.
1. Click **Task Details** in the left panel .
1. Go to the **Overview** area to view more information about the task.

   By default, Overview is the first area on the Task Details section and it is expanded.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Depending on how your Workfront administrator or Group administrator sets up our Layout Template, the fields in the Task Details section might be rearranged or not display. For information, see [Customize the Details view using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-details-view-layout-template.md).

1. Click the **Edit** icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of the Details section, then click **Overview**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You cannot edit fields that are automatically generated by Workfront or that you don't have permissions to edit.

1. Edit any field that is available for editing, by single-clicking the field or click **+Add** to add information to an empty field.
1. View or edit any of the following fields listed.

   Not all fields are editable. &nbsp;

         <p> Elapsed time is a unit of time for a task's Duration. It is the time between the Planned Start Date and the Planned Completion Date of a task that includes holidays, weekends, and time off. In other words, elapsed time is the passage of calendar days. Regular time takes into account holidays, weekends, and time off and excludes them from the Duration of the task.
