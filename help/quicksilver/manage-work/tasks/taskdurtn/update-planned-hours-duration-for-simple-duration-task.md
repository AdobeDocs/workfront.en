# Update the Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type

By default, Adobe Workfront calculates the Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type based on the amount of Planned Hours. However, you can also manually edit the amount of Planned Hours and the Duration of a Simple Duration task in certain areas of Workfront.

You can either edit Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type inline or at the task level in the Assignments area.

For more information about editing information inline, see [Inline edit items in a list in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/inline-edit-objects.md).

This article describes how you can update the Planned Hours and Duration for a task with a Simple Duration Type at the task level, in the Assignments area.

## Update the Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>After you manually update the Duration on a Simple Duration task, Workfront stops calculating it based on the Planned Hours.

To edit the Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type in the Advanced Assignments box:

1. In a task list, click the name of the task for which you want to change the duration type.
1. Do one of the following:

   * Click the **More** icon ![](assets/qs-more-icon-on-an-object.png) next to the name of the task, click **Edit**, then **Assignments**. 
   * Click the **Assigned to** or the name of the assignments in the Assignments area of the task header, then click **Advanced**.

1. Enter a total value for the **Planned Hours** for all the assignments, for example, 10 hours. The total number of Planned Hours is distributed equally between all the resources assigned to the task.
1. (Optional) Manually adjust the Planned Hours of each resource assigned to the task. The total number of Planned Hours for the task updates to reflect the new hours individually assigned to your resources.
1. Enter a value for the task **Duration**, for example 2 Days.
