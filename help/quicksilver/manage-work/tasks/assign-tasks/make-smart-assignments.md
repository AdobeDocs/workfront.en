# Make smart assignments

You can use smart assignments to identify who the best user is to complete the work. Smart assignments are suggestions for users that Adobe Workfront presents to you when you assign work items to resources based on an algorithm that determines the most appropriate resource for the job. For information about smart assignments, see [Smart assignments overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
