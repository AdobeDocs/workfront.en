# Make smart assignments

You can use smart assignments to identify who the best user is to complete the work. Smart assignments are suggestions for users that Adobe Workfront presents to you when you assign work items to resources based on an algorithm that determines the most appropriate resource for the job. For information about smart assignments, see [Smart assignments overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Tasks and Issues</p> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Contribute or higher permissions with the ability to make assignments on tasks and issues</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>

## Make smart assignments

Smart assignments are available in most locations where you can make assignments in Workfront.

1. Go to an issue or a task and click one of the following fields to edit them: &nbsp;&nbsp;

  * A task or issue list or report 
  * Resource Scheduling
  * Workload Balancer

1. Place your cursor in the assignment field, and wait for two seconds. The ``Suggestions or Suggested Assignments list displays.

   Users displayed in this list are the smart assignment suggestions for the task or the issue.

   For more information about where the smart assignments display, see the "Locate smart assignment suggestions" section in the article [Smart assignments overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md) . 

1. Select the user in the recommendations list by clicking their name. Clicking Assign to me assigns the work item to yourself.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If there are no suggestions, the suggestion list does not open.

1. (Optional) If you do not want to use one of the recommended users from the smart assignments list, start typing the name of the desired user and select the name when it appears in the list.

   The selected user is assigned to the task or issue.
