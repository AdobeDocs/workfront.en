# Create tasks in a project

You can create tasks in a project only after you created the project.

For example, after creating a project, you might want to add tasks and modify them to organize the project plan. For more information about creating a project, see [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).

For information about creating personal tasks that are not in a project, see the "Create a personal task" section in the article [Create work items from the Home area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/create-work-items-in-home.md).

This article describes how you create tasks from scratch. You can also create tasks in the following ways:

* By copying or duplicating existing tasks.&nbsp;For information, see [Copy and duplicate tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/copy-and-duplicate-tasks.md).
* By moving tasks from one project to another.&nbsp;For information, see [Move tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/move-tasks.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td>

For information about access to tasks, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-tasks.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to tasks</a>. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Contribute permissions to the project with ability to Add Tasks or higher</p> <p>When you create a task you automatically receive Manage permissions to the task</p> <p> For information about task permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-task.md" class="MCXref xref">Share a task in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront</a>. </p> <p>For information on requesting additional permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td>

## Create tasks in a project

1. Go to the project where you want to create a task.
1. Click **Tasks** in the left panel. 
1. (Conditional) If you are currently viewing the task list in an agile view, click the **List View** icon ![](assets/list-view-in-agile-view-for-tasks.png) in the upper-right corner to display the task list. 
1. (Optional) Click the **Plan Mode** icon ![](assets/nwe-plan-mode-icon-task-list.png) and select **Manual Save**, then select either **Standard** or **Timeline Planning**. This disables the **Autosave** option which is enabled by default.

1. (Conditional)&nbsp;If you clicked **New Task** do the following:

  1. Specify any of the fields on the limited list of fields inside the **New Task** box, then click&nbsp;**Create Task** if you want to quickly create a task.

     The **Create Task** box opens.

     &nbsp;

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >Depending on how your Workfront administrator sets up our Layout Template, the fields in the Create Task box might display different fields in your environment. For information, see [Customize the Details view using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-details-view-layout-template.md).

  1. Specify information for the following areas in the left panel of the Create Task box:

    * Task Name
    * Overview
    * Assignments
    * Custom&nbsp;Forms
    * Finance
    * Settings

      For information about defining all task-related fields on a task, see [Edit tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks.md).

  1. (Conditional and optional) If you want the task to be recurring, update the **Recurrence Frequency** field. For more information about creating recurring tasks, see [Create recurring tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-recurring-tasks.md).
  1. (Optional) Click **Documents** in the left panel to attach a document to the new task, then click **Add or link files** to add a document to the task from your computer, another service, or to link documents and folders from your computer or another service.

1. (Conditional) If you clicked **Add More Tasks** in step 5, start entering the task information using in-line editing, then press Enter.

   We recommend using this option especially when adding multiple tasks to the list.

       This makes the new task a child or subtask of the previous task.

    1. (Conditional) If you disabled the **Autosave** option after pressing **Add More Tasks**, you may do the following:

      * Click **Undo** at any time to reverse your last change, or **Cancel** to reverse all the changes you made to the task list. 
      * If you previously clicked **Undo**, click **Redo** to re-apply the last change you canceled.
      * Click **Save** to save your changes to the task list.
