A campaign is a new object in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] that allows you to organize work across multiple projects. A campaign is a larger work object than projects, similar but not identical to portfolios or programs. A campaign can be  associated with multiple projects that may or may not belong to different portfolios or programs.

## Create a campaign

1. Click the [!UICONTROL **Main Menu**] icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of [!DNL Workfront], then click [!UICONTROL **Campaigns**].

   A list of all campaigns in the system displays.
1. Click [!UICONTROL **New Campaign**].
1. Update the name of the campaign by inline editing it in the header. By default, the campaign's name is [!UICONTROL **Untitled Campaign**].
1. (Optional) Update the [!UICONTROL **Campaign Owner**] in the header of the new campaign. As the creator of the campaign, you are designated as the owner of the campaign.
1. (Optional) Click [!UICONTROL **[!UICONTROL Campaign Details]**] in the left panel and update or review the following fields:
   * [!UICONTROL **Description**]: Add additional information about the campaign.
   * [!UICONTROL **Campaign Owner**]: By default, the campaign owner is the user who created the campaign. When you replace the original owner of the campaign with another user, the user you specify is automatically given permissions to edit the campaign. The user who is designated as the Campaign Owner must be a [!DNL Workfront] active user.
   * [!UICONTROL **Entry Date**]: This is the date when the campaign was created. You cannot edit the Entry Date.
   * [!UICONTROL **Last Updated By**]: This is the name of the user who updated the campaign last. You cannot edit the [!UICONTROL Last Updated By] field.
   * [!UICONTROL **Entered By**]: This is the name of the user who created the campaign. You cannot edit the [!UICONTROL Entered By] field.
