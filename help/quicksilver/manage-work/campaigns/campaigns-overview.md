To centralize and align the work happening across multiple portfolios or programs, you can associate your projects with campaigns. You can manage the dependencies, resources, and finances of all projects in one place.

For example, you can capture the work necessary to complete a marketing campaign called "Summer campaign" that includes various projects across the organization. Each project might cover a limited scope (Social media project, Product readiness project, Stream advertising project, for example), but all of them are ultimately responsible for delivering the larger initiative of completing the Summer campaign. Associating all projects with the one campaign allows you to manage everything in one place.

>[!NOTE]

>A campaign is a new object in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] that allows you to organize work across multiple projects. A campaign is a larger work item  than projects, similar but not identical to portfolios or programs. A campaign can be associated with multiple projects that may or may not belong to different portfolios or programs.

Because you can associate the same project with multiple campaigns, [!DNL Workfront] allows you to organize work both vertically and horizontally in your strategic roadmap and move away from the linear hierarchy you have been used to so far.

For information about creating campaigns, see [Create campaigns](create-campaigns.md).

## Benefits of using campaigns

The following are some of the benefits of campaigns:

* You can add multiple projects to a campaign. This connects multiple programs or portfolios that the projects belong to with the same unified effort.
* You can add the same project to multiple campaigns to indicate that the work of one project might affect several larger efforts.
* With multi-level breadcrumbs, you can access all work objects from one central page, that of one object.


## Considerations when using campaigns

* Only system or group administrators can see the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area in a [!UICONTROL Layout Template] and can add it for other users. No users can see the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area in the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] by default.
* All users, regardless of their access level, can create a campaign.
* All users, regardless of their access level, can see all campaigns when they access the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area from the [!UICONTROL Main Menu].
* You can edit or delete a campaign only when you are the owner of the campaign or when you are the system administrator.
