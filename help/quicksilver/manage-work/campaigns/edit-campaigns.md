A campaign is a new object in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] that allows you to organize work across multiple projects. A campaign is a larger work object than projects, similar but not identical to portfolios or programs.  A campaign can be  associated with multiple projects that may or may not belong to different portfolios or programs.

For information about creating campaigns, see [Create campaigns](create-campaigns.md).
