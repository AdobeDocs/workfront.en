1. (Optional) Click the [!UICONTROL **search**] icon ![](assets/search-icon.png) to quickly search for a campaign using a keyword.
1. Click the name of a campaign to open it. 

   The [!UICONTROL Projects] section should open by default.
1. Click [!UICONTROL **New Project**], then [!UICONTROL **Existing Project**].  

   The Add projects box opens and displays a list of projects.
1. (Optional) Click the [!UICONTROL **search**] icon ![](assets/search-icon.png) to type a keyword and find a particular project.
1. (Optional) Click the [!UICONTROL **Filter**], [!UICONTROL **View**], or [!UICONTROL **Grouping**] icons to modify the list of projects in the list.
1. Select the projects that you want to add to the campaign, then click [!UICONTROL **Add**].
   
   The projects are added to the [!UICONTROL Projects] section of the campaign.
1. (Optional) Click a project to open it.

   If the added project belongs to multiple campaigns, there is an indication in the breadcrumb of the project that displays all the campaigns connected to the project.
   
   If the project belongs to a portfolio or a program, the campaign displays in the breadcrumb after the program and immediately before the project.
