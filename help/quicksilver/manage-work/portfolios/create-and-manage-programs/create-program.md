A program represents a collection of projects that share a common strategy, objective, or goal that transcends project boundaries. 
Programs are a subdivision of portfolios and they cannot exist outside of a portfolio. Programs typically share the same resources as other programs within the same portfolio. 

You can create programs to organize your portfolios when they become too large. 

For example, you can have a Marketing Fiscal Year 2024 Portfolio that contains all your Marketing division's projects. You might want to consider further organizing your projects into fiscal quarters and add Marketing Fiscal Quarter 1-4 2024 programs within the Marketing Fiscal Year 2024 Portfolio.

## Ways to create programs

You can create a program in Workfront using one of the following methods:

* Create a program from scratch starting in the Programs area of the Main Menu, or in the Programs section of a portfolio. This article describes how you can create a program from scratch. 

* Import a program using kick-starts.

   As a Workfront administrator, you can import programs using a kick-start.

   For information about importing data using kick-starts in Workfront, see [Import data into Adobe Workfront using a Kick-Start template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/using-kick-starts/import-data-via-kickstarts.md).


* Add programs as you connect them from a record type in Workfront Planning. 

   You must have an additional Workfront Planning package.

   For information about access to Workfront Planning, see [Adobe Workfront Planning access overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/access-overview.md).

   For information about creating portfolios by adding them to records, see the section "Create records as you connect them" in the article [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).

1. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL Program Manager]** in the header of the program to update it.

   >[!TIP]

    <col> 
    <thead> 
     <tr> 
      <th>Field</th> 
      <th>Description</th> 
     </tr>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Description]</td> 
      <td> <p>Specify a description for the program.</p> <p>The description is displayed on the landing page of the program.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Program Manager]</td> 
      <td> <p>Begin typing the name of the user who you want to act as the Program Manager, then click the user's name when it appears in the drop-down list. This is the same as the [!UICONTROL Program Owner]. </p> <p>Tip: You can also update the Program Manager in the program header. </p> </td>

      <td> <p>Add the name of a single group if the group owns the program or has responsibility for completing it. </p> <p>You can make sure you are selecting the right group by hovering over it and clicking the [!UICONTROL information] icon <img src="assets/info-icon.png"> that displays next to it. This displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and its administrators.</p> 
       <div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> 
        <img src="assets/group-details-widget-programs-350x268.png" style="width: 350;height: 268;">

## Program header overview

You can find some information about the program in its header.

The following information displays in the header of a program:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Header Information</td> 
   <td> <strong>Notes</strong> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Breadcrumb with the name of the portfolio</td> 
   <td>You can access the portfolio that the program belongs to from the header of the program. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Name of the program</td> 
   <td>You can edit the program name in the header.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Name of the object type and activation status</td> 
   <td>The word "Program" displays with an orange icon when you view a program. The word "[!UICONTROL Deactivated]" displays next to it and the outline is gray if the program is not marked as [!UICONTROL Active]. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">The actions area of the program </td> 
   <td> <p>Click any of the following to access more information or editing options for the program:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>The star icon to add the program to your list of Favorites</li> 
     <li> <p>The [!UICONTROL More] menu <img src="assets/qs-more-menu.png"> to do one of the following: </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Edit the program</li> 
       <li>Deactivate it. When a program is deactivated, you can no longer associate it with projects at the project level. </li> 
       <li> <p>Delete it. Deleting the program does not delete the projects in the program. It removes the association of the projects with the program. </p> </li> 
       <li>Share it with others</li> 
      </ul> </li> 
    </ul> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Percent Complete]</td> 
   <td> <p>You cannot edit the [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] of the program in the header. This information is updated from the projects in the program. By default, the percent complete of the program is an average of the percent complete values of the projects in a [!UICONTROL Current] or [!UICONTROL Approved] status that belong to the program.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Program Manager]</td> 
   <td> <p>You can edit the Program Manager in the header. This is the same as the [!UICONTROL Program Owner]. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date]</td> 
   <td>You cannot edit the Planned Completion Date of the program in the header. This information is updated from the projects in the program. The Planned Completion Date of the latest project in the program becomes the Planned Completion date of the program.  </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Active Projects Condition]</td> 
   <td>This is a calculation of what percentage of projects in the program have the [!UICONTROL Condition] set as [!UICONTROL On Target], [!UICONTROL At Risk], or [!UICONTROL In Trouble]. The projects represented here are projects with a status of [!UICONTROL Current] and [!UICONTROL Approved]. </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Move a program

You can add existing programs to a portfolio. Because programs cannot exist in two different portfolios, adding an existing program permanently moves it from one portfolio to another.

For more information, see [Add an existing program to a portfolio](../../../manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-programs/move-program.md).
