# Delete and deactivate programs

A program represents a collection of projects that share a common strategy, objective, or goal that transcends project boundaries. Programs are a subdivision of portfolios and they cannot exist outside of a portfolio. Programs typically share the same resources as other programs within the same portfolio. 

When a program becomes irrelevant, you can do one of the following things to prevent users from associating projects with the program: 

* Deactivate it: Exiting projects remain associated with the program and with its respective portfolio. Users no longer see the program as an option when trying to associate new projects with the program.
* Delete it: Existing projects lose their association with the program and they move directly under the portfolio. Users no longer see the program as an option when trying to associate their future projects with the program.

We recommend deactivating a portfolio, rather than deleting it, to preserve the historical information for your projects. However, sometimes, deleting a program might be necessary.
