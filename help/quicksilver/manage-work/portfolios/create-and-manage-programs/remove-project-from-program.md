# Remove a project from a program

You may remove a project from a program by doing one of the following:

* Move it to another program.
* Permanently remove it from the current program and do not associate it with another program.
* Permanently delete the project.

  For information about deleting projects, see [Delete projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/delete-projects.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:
