# Programs overview in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]

<!-- Audited: 09/2024 -->

In Adobe Workfront, a program is a collection of projects that have unifying characteristics. For example, they might compete for the same budget, resources, or time frame. Programs are a sub-group of portfolios. 

This article contains general information about programs in Workfront.

## Access needed to create programs

<!--leave the table uncollapsed as this article is about access-->

You must have the following access to create and manage portfolios:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>New: Any</p>
   <p>Current: [!UICONTROL Business] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>New: [!UICONTROL Standard]</p>
   <p>Current: [!UICONTROL Plan] </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Edit] access to Portfolios and Programs</p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to edit a program or add projects to it</p>
   <p>Manage permissions to the portfolio that the program belongs to </p>
   <p>View permissions to a program to view it</p>
   <p>After you create a program, you have Manage permissions to it, by default</p> 
    </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>

## Considerations about working with programs

* You can use both portfolios and programs to organize projects. Through organizing projects, you can compare similar projects and determine where resources will be best spent.

* Programs are a sub-group of portfolios. If a portfolio contains too many projects, you can divide it in multiple programs and organize the projects first by program, and secondly by portfolio. 

    For example, you can have a Marketing 2024 portfolio that is divided into four quarterly programs. 

* Projects that belong to the same program usually compete for the same resources, budget, or time slot. 

* You must first create a portfolio and then you can create multiple programs inside the same portfolio. 

    For information about using Programs, see [Create a program](../../../manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-programs/create-program.md).

* You must first create a portfolio, then a program before you can associate a project to a program and a portfolio. 

* When you create projects, programs, and portfolios, consider the following:

    * A project can be independent, without being associated with a program or portfolio.
    * A project can be associated with a portfolio, but it does not need to also be associated with a program. 
    * A program must always be associated with a portfolio. It can never exist outside a portfolio. 
    * A project associated with a program is always associated with the program's portfolio. 
    * A program can only be associated with one portfolio.
    * A project can be associated only with one program and the program's portfolio at a time. 
    * A portfolio can have multiple programs and projects. 
    * A program can have multiple projects. 

    For information about creating projects and portfolios, see the following articles:
    * [Create a project](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md)
    * [Create a portfolio](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-portfolios/create-portfolios.md)


* You can use the portfolio optimizer to analyze the performance of all projects inside a portfolio. You cannot compare the performance of multiple projects across the same program alone. You must analyze project performance at the portfolio level. 

    For information, see [Optimize projects in the Portfolio Optimizer](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/portfolios/portfolio-optimizer/optimize-projects-in-portfolio-optimizer.md).
