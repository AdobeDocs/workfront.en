# Add a project to a program

<!--Audited: 5/2025-->

You can organize your projects by adding them to programs within portfolios. You can have multiple projects inside of one program, but you can associate only one program with a project.

You must create a portfolio and a program inside this portfolio before you can add a project to a program.

Adding a project to a program automatically adds it to the program's portfolio at the same time.

For information about creating portfolios, see [Create a portfolio](../../../manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-portfolios/create-portfolios.md).

For information about creating programs, see [Create a program](../../../manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-programs/create-program.md).
