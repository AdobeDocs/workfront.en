# Add a project to a program

You can organize your projects by adding them to&nbsp;programs within&nbsp;portfolios. You can have multiple projects inside of one program, but you can associate only one program with a project.

You must create a portfolio and a program inside this portfolio before you can add a project to a program.

For information about creating portfolios, see [Create a portfolio](../../../manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-portfolios/create-portfolios.md).

For information about creating programs, see [Create a program](../../../manage-work/portfolios/create-and-manage-programs/create-program.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Team or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access to Programs or higher</p> <p>Edit access to Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions to the program</p> <p>Manage permissions to the projects</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td>
