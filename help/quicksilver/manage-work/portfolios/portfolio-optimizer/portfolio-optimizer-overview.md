# [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] overview

<!-- Audited: 01/2024 -->

The [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] is the tool used for project evaluation and comparison. The process of reviewing and comparing [!UICONTROL Business Case] values for projects assigned to a portfolio is how a portfolio manager can prioritize projects and generate the most value for an organization.

![Portfolio optimizer with projects](assets/portfolio-optimizer-with-projects-nwe-350x89.png)

The purpose of the [!UICONTROL portfolio optimizer] is to provide an interface through which a portfolio manager, steering committee, or product management office can view summary information about the business case of each project. Projects can then be prioritized according to strategic values and goals, or according to their overall score.

The [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] can only assist you if you have completed the following prerequisites:

* The [!UICONTROL Business Cases] have been completed on the projects. For information, see the articles in [Define a Business Case: article index](../../projects/define-a-business-case/define-business-case.md).
* A portfolio is defined in the Project Overview area of Project Details section for the projects you want to review.
* You have indicated the Project Budget and Planned Benefit for the projects you want to review. Fixed Cost and Fixed Revenue are optional but add additional value. For information, see [Project finances fields](../../projects/project-finances/project-finances-overview-1.md).

For information about locating the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer], see [Locate the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]](../../../manage-work/portfolios/portfolio-optimizer/locate-portfolio-optimizer.md).

## Finances in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]

You can see the financial state of your portfolio at any time during the life of your projects when using the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer].

Consider the following when working with finances in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]:

* Projects are each given a score when their [!UICONTROL Business Cases] are completed according to what criteria they match in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]. For example, low cost or high alignment projects receive a higher score.

   For more information about calculating the portfolio optimizer score of a project, see [Overview of the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] Score](../../../manage-work/portfolios/portfolio-optimizer/portfolio-optimizer-score.md).

* The financial calculations for the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] use the [!UICONTROL Budgeted Cost] in the [!UICONTROL Business Case] of the project.
* You can manually prioritize your projects in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer], taking into account all the information about them. This includes financial data, alignment to their scorecards, and ROI, for example.

### The financial areas in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] {#the-financial-areas-in-the-portfolio-optimizer}

You can view financial information in the following areas of the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]:

* **[!UICONTROL Portfolio Header]**: This area displays financial information gathered from all the projects in the portfolio. It displays on every tab of the Portfolio object.
* **[!UICONTROL Portfolio Finances for Selected Projects]**: This area displays financial information gathered from the projects that are selected in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]. You can add or remove projects and understand how this will affect the finances of the portfolio by viewing the information in this area.
* **[!UICONTROL Projects Finances]**: This area displays the financial information of each project listed in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer].

### The financial fields in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]  {#the-financial-fields-in-the-portfolio-optimizer}

The following financial fields display in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]:

* [Portfolio header](#portfolio-header)
* [Portfolio finances for selected projects](#portfolio-finances-for-selected-projects)

#### Portfolio header {#portfolio-header}

![Portfolio header](assets/portfolio-header-nwe-350x14.png)

[!DNL Adobe Workfront] calculates the financial fields in the portfolio header using information from projects with statuses that equate only with [!UICONTROL Approved] or [!UICONTROL Current].
