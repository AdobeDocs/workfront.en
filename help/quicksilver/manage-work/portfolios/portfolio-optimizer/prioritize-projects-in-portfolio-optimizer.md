# Prioritize projects in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]

You can prioritize your projects in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer], to establish the order in which they should be completed.

Consider the following when using the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]:

* The projects at the top of the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] are considered more important than the ones listed towards the bottom. You will need to complete the projects in order of their priority in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] for the Portfolio to be optimized. 
* The priority of projects in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] is unrelated to the [!UICONTROL Priority] field located on the [!UICONTROL Project Details] tab of a project.

   The [!UICONTROL Priority] field on the [!UICONTROL Project Details] tab is a visual flag that you manually specify to understand how important a project should be.

* The priority of projects in the Portfolio Optimizer is visible in the [!DNL Resource Planner], if it is enabled there. In the [!DNL Resource Planner], projects receive resources in the order of their [!UICONTROL Resource Planner] priority, and not that of the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Priority].

   For information about prioritizing projects in the [!UICONTROL Resource Planner], see the article [Prioritize projects in the [!UICONTROL Resource Planner]](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/prioritize-projects-resource-planner.md).

* The **[!UICONTROL Project Prioritization]** area of the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] displays projects in the order of [!UICONTROL Planned Start Dates] and [!UICONTROL Net Value], by default.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Set Priority]** in the project optimization area when you finish re-arranging your projects. The projects will receive a new number based on the new order.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the new project priority in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]. The priority is listed as a number in the number **#** column.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >This does not necessarily change the order of the projects in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer], because the list of projects might be sorted by a column other than the **#** column. Click the **#** column header to order the list by project priority.

   You can see the priority of the project as it appears in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] in the Resource Planner, by enabling the **[!UICONTROL Display Portfolio Priorities]** setting in the Resource Planner.

   For information about prioritizing projects in the [!UICONTROL Resource Planner], see the article [Prioritize projects in the [!UICONTROL Resource Planner]](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/prioritize-projects-resource-planner.md).
