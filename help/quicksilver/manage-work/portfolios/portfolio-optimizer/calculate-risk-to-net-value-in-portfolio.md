# Calculate the [!UICONTROL Risk to Net Value] in a portfolio

In the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer], the [!UICONTROL Risk to Net Value] indicator measures the Potential Risk taking into account the [!UICONTROL Net Value] provided by all projects displayed in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer].&nbsp;

For achieving the most efficiency within the portfolio, you want to see that the [!UICONTROL Risk] indicator is low and the [!UICONTROL Net Value] indicator is high.&nbsp;

The [!UICONTROL Risk] and [!UICONTROL Net Value] indicators are represented from the perspective of how they relate to each other.

[!DNL Adobe Workfront] calculates the [!UICONTROL Risk] and [!UICONTROL Net Value] indicators using the following formulas:

* The [!UICONTROL Risk] indicator is calculated by the following formula:

   ```
   Risk indicator = Risk / (Risk + Net Value)
   ```

* The [!DNL Net Value] indicator is calculated by the following formulas:

   ```
   Net Value indicator = 1 - Risk / (Risk + Net Value)
   ```

   Or

   ```
   Net Value indicator = Net Value / (Risk + Net Value)
   ```

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Risk to Net Value] indicator calculates based on the projects that you display in the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer], and not on all the projects which are associated with the portfolio.&nbsp;
