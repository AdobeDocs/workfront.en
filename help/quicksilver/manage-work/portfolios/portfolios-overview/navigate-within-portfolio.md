In Adobe Workfront, a portfolio represents a collection of projects that compete for the same resources, budget, schedule, and priority. The primary purpose of the portfolio is to assist executives and project&nbsp;managers in selecting to work on projects that provide the most benefit to an organization.

For more information about portfolios, see [Portfolio overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/portfolios/portfolios-overview/portfolio-overview.md).
