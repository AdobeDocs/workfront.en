In [!DNL Adobe Workfront], a portfolio represents a collection of projects that compete for the same resources, budget, schedule, and priority. The primary purpose of the portfolio is to assist executives and project managers in selecting to work on projects that provide the most benefit to an organization.

For more information about portfolios, see [Understand portfolio methodology](../../../manage-work/portfolios/portfolios-overview/portfolio-overview.md).
