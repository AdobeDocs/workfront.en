# Delete and deactivate portfolios

Portfolios are collections of projects or programs in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]. You can delete or deactivate a portfolio if you find that it's irrelevant for your system.

We recommend deactivating a portfolio that no longer needs to be associated with future projects instead of deleting it, to keep the historic information on the projects that are currently associated with the portfolio and its programs.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan] </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Edit] access to Projects and Portfolios</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Manage] permissions on the portfolio </p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Overview of deleting and deactivating portfolios

Consider the following when deciding whether to delete or deactivate portfolios:

* Deleting a portfolio deletes the programs associated with it.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >You do not need to have any permissions to programs to be able to delete the portfolio.

* Deleting a portfolio does not delete the projects associated with it.
* You cannot recover deleted portfolios.
* Deactivating a portfolio ensures that the name of the portfolio and its programs can no longer be assigned to projects when creating a project.
