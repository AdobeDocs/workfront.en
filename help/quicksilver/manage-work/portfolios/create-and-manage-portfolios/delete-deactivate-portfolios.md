# Delete and deactivate portfolios

<!--Audited: 2/2024-->

Portfolios are collections of projects or programs in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]. You can delete or deactivate a portfolio if you find that it's irrelevant for your system.

We recommend deactivating a portfolio that no longer needs to be associated with future projects instead of deleting it, to keep the historic information on the projects that are currently associated with the portfolio and its programs.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license</td> 
   <td> <p>New: [!UICONTROL Standard] </p>
   <p>Current: [!UICONTROL Plan] </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Edit] access to Projects and Portfolios</p>  </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Manage] permissions on the portfolio </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

For more detail about the information in this table, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md).

## Overview of deleting and deactivating portfolios

Consider the following when deciding whether to delete or deactivate portfolios:

* Deleting a portfolio deletes the programs associated with it.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >You do not need to have any permissions to programs to be able to delete the portfolio.

* Deleting a portfolio does not delete the projects associated with it.
* You cannot recover deleted portfolios.
* Deactivating a portfolio ensures that the name of the portfolio and its programs can no longer be assigned to projects when creating a project.

## Deactivate a portfolio

When you deactivate a portfolio, you can still access it from the [!UICONTROL Portfolios] area, but it no longer displays in the list of portfolios when users try to add it to a project.
