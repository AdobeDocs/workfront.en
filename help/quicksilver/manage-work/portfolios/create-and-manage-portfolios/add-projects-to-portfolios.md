# Add projects to a portfolio

We recommend that you add projects to portfolios when you initiate them. However, you can add them to a portfolio at any time during their lifetime.

Consider the following when adding projects to portfolios: 

* Although a portfolio may contain an unlimited number of projects, you can associate only one portfolio with a project.
* A project remains in a portfolio until it is removed or associated with another portfolio.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Business] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan] </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL View] access to Portfolios or higher</p> <p>[!UICONTROL Edit] access to Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL View] permissions to the portfolio</p> <p>[!UICONTROL Manage] permissions to the projects</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.
