# Add projects to a portfolio

<!--Audited: 7/2024-->

We recommend that you add projects to portfolios when you initiate them. However, you can add them to a portfolio at any time during their lifetime.

Consider the following when adding projects to portfolios: 

* Although a portfolio may contain an unlimited number of projects, you can associate only one portfolio with a project.
* A project remains in a portfolio until it is removed or associated with another portfolio.
