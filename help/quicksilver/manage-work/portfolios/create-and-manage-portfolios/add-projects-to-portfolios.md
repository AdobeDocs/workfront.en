<!--Audited: 5/2025-->

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment for all customers.

We recommend that you add projects to portfolios when you initiate them. However, you can add them to a portfolio at any time during their lifetime.

Consider the following when adding projects to portfolios: 

* Although a portfolio may contain an unlimited number of projects, you can associate only one portfolio with a project.
* A project remains in a portfolio until it is removed or associated with another portfolio.
