# Review Requested Projects

When multiple project requests are submitted for review, the project management office or portfolio committee can meet to review submitted requests and determine project request approvals. To submit a project request for review, do one of the following:

* Change the project status to **Requested**.
* Complete the Business Case of the project and submit it for approval.   
  For more information about completing a Business Case for a project, see [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

You can review requested projects in the following areas of Adobe Workfront:

* In a project report
* Within a portfolio

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">

## Review Requested Projects in a project report

You can build a report for projects to see what projects have a status of Requested.

For more information about approving project requests by building a project report, see the [Approving the Business Case by Building a Project Report](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/approve-business-case.md#build-a-report) section in [Approve a Business Case](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/approve-business-case.md).&nbsp;
