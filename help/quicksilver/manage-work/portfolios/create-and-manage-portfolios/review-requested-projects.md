# Review Requested Projects

When multiple project requests are submitted for review, the project management office or portfolio committee can meet to review submitted requests and determine project request approvals. Project requests display as projects with a status of [!UICONTROL Requested] in [!DNL Adobe Workfront].

You can submit a project request for review by doing one of the following:

* Change the project status to **[!UICONTROL Requested]**.
* Complete the [!UICONTROL Business Case] of the project and submit it for approval.\
   For more information about completing a Business Case for a project, see [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

You can review requested projects in the following areas of [!DNL Adobe Workfront]:

* In a project report
* Within a portfolio
