# Share project templates

You can share a template with users, or you can define how the projects that are created from a template will be shared with users by using the following sharing options at the template level.

When sharing an object in Adobe Workfront, you allow other users to view, contribute to, or edit that object.

For information about Workfront permissions, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

For information about the permissions you can give users when sharing a template, see [Sharing a template](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-template.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Templates</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to a template</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
