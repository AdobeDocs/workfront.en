# Create project templates from examples

<!--Audited: 08/2025-->

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can download several preconfigured templates in your Workfront instance using Blueprints. For more information, see [Configure a blueprint](../../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/configure-template-package.md).

As a user with any Workfront license, you can request a blueprint template to be installed. For more information, see [Browse the blueprints catalog and request installation of blueprints](../../../administration-and-setup/blueprints/browse-catalog.md).

Blueprints provides basic building blocks to help you create a work management system that grows with you. You can browse the blueprints catalog and install ready-to-use project templates.

Each template is targeted to a department and specific maturity level to help you implement proven best practices in your system faster.
