# Create template from project

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(Note: Keep this article in the Creating and Managing Templates area with the detailed information that this contains. Since this is an article about creating TEMPLATES, this needs to be detailed under Templates; there is a similar article with almost the same title in Managing projects that points to this one - since this functionality is in the UI under Projects, this article must have a presence in that areas as well. Keep both, but make this one the only editable one (iterative))</p>
-->

You can create templates when you save an existing project as a template.

After you save an existing project as a template, you can use the new template to create new projects. This simplifies and expedites the project creation process.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When saving a project as a template, the actual dates of the tasks and of the project do not save for the template. 
>
>A template and its tasks do not have actual dates, but rather an indication of which day (from when the future project might start) a task might start and on which day the task might need to complete. When using templates to create the future projects, the projects will receive actual dates. For information, see [Create a project](../create-projects/create-project.md).

## Create template from project

1. Go to the project that you want to save as a template. 
1. Click the **More** menu ![More icon](assets/qs-more-icon-on-an-object.png), then **Save as Template**. 
1. Specify the following information for the template:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
      <td>Specify a name for the template.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Description</td> 
      <td>Provide a description for the template.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Is Active</td> 
      <td> <p>Select from the following options:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> <p><strong>Yes</strong>: Other users can find the template and attach it to projects.</p> </li> 
        <li><strong>No</strong>: Other users cannot find the template and cannot attach it to projects.</li> 
       </ul> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Custom Forms</td> 
      <td>Use the drop-down list to select any custom forms to attach to the template. If any custom forms have already been associated with the project, all of the data fields from those custom forms are displayed.<br>You can include up to 10 custom forms on a single template.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **Manage Forms** to remove or reorder the forms. For information about how to remove and reorder custom forms on the template, see [Custom forms](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-and-manage-custom-forms.md).
