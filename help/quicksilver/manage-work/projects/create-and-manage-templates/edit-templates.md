You can edit project templates to reflect changes in the processes and settings of future projects. 

After you update and save the changes on a template, the new changes are visible in new projects when the projects are created using the template. 

The changes you make on the template do not reflect on  projects currently using that template.

You can edit one template at a time, or you can edit templates in bulk.

>Because linked folders are created when the project is created, editing the linked folder workflow on an existing project is ineffective. Editing these values when creating a project functions as expected.-->

<!-- This section is here by mistake - it should be maybe in layout templates?? 

### Linked folders (conditional availability) {#linked-folders}

This section appears only if all of the following apply:

* Your organization has been migrated to the Adobe Admin Console
* Your organization has enabled and configured an integration with Adobe Experience Manager
* The template has enabled and configured linked folders.

For instructions on editing Linked folders, see [Edit workflow values in a project](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/use-aem-workflows.md#edit-workflow-values-in-a-project) in the article [Use workflows in the Experience Manager Assets integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/use-aem-workflows.md).

## Add tasks to a template

After you have created your template and have edited the template information, you can add tasks to it.

Adding tasks to a template is similar to adding tasks to a project.

For more information about adding tasks to a project, see [Create tasks in a project](../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-tasks-in-project.md).

When you add tasks to a template, the Duration of the template and the Start and Completion Days of the template change accordingly. For information about the Start and Completion Days of the template and of the template tasks, see [Overview of Start and Completion Days in a template](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/overview-of-start-completion-day-on-template.md).

## Add more items to a template

After you have created your template and have edited the template information, you can add more items to it. The items you add will be available for the project when you are creating it from the template.

Adding the following items to a template is identical to adding them to a project:

* Documents
* Risks

  For more information about creating risks, see [Create and edit risks on projects](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-edit-risks-on-projects.md).

* Approval processes

  For information about associating approval processes with work, see [Associate a new or existing approval process with work](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/associate-approval-with-work.md).

* Billing Rates

  Adding billing rates for a template is similar to adding billing rates to a project. For more information, see [Override Job Role Billing Rates at the project level](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/project-finances/override-job-role-billing-rates-at-the-project-level.md).

* Expenses

  For more information about adding expenses, see [Manage project expenses](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/manage-project-expenses.md).

* Queue Details

   For information about adding Queue Details to a project or a template, see [Create a Request Queue](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

* Topic Groups and Queue Topics

  For information about adding Topic Groups and Queue Topics to a project or template, see the following articles:
  
   * [Create Topic Groups](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-topic-groups.md)
   * [Create Queue Topics](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-queue-topics.md)

You can add the following items to the tasks in the template:

* Documents
* Expenses

  For more information about adding expenses, see [Manage project expenses](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/manage-project-expenses.md).

* Approvals

  For more information about associating approvals with work, see [Associate a new or existing approval process with work](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/associate-approval-with-work.md).


## Activate or deactivate a template

You can deactivate a template if you want users to not be able to find it and create proojects from it. You cannot attach a deactivated template to projects nor use it to create a project. 

Deactivated templates do not affect existing projects that were created using them. 

To deactivate a template: 

1. Go to an active template, then click the **More** ![More icon](assets/qs-more-icon-on-an-object.png) menu next to the template name, then click **Deactivate**. 

   ![Deactivate template](assets/deactivate-template-link-in-more-menu.png)

   The template is no longer active and users can no longer find it to create projects from it.
1. (Optional) To activate the template, click the **More** ![More icon](assets/qs-more-icon-on-an-object.png) menu next to the template name, then click **Activate**. 

   The template is now active and can be attached to projects or used to create projects.
