# Update project owners and sponsors

<!--Audited: 07/2024-->

When you create a project in Adobe Workfront, you are automatically set as the Project  Owner of the project. You can update this field with another user. You can also update the Project Sponsor field of a project.

For information about projects owners and sponsors, see [Overview of project owners and sponsors](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-owners-and-sponsors.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>You can identify an owner and a sponsor for a template. When you create a project from that template, the Template Owner becomes the Project Owner and the Template Sponsor becomes the Project Sponsor. 
>
>If the template does not have an Owner, the user who creates the project from the teamplate becomes the Project Owner.
>
>For information about editing templates, see [Edit project templates](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/edit-templates.md).
