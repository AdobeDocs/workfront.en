# Update project owners and sponsors

When you create a project in Adobe Workfront, you are automatically set as the Project&nbsp;Owner of the project. You can update this field with another user. You can also update the Project Sponsor field of a project.

For information about projects owners and sponsors, see [Overview of project owners and sponsors](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-owners-and-sponsors.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>You can identify an owner and a sponsor for a template. When you create a project from that template, the Template Owner becomes the Project Owner and the Template Sponsor becomes the Project Sponsor.&nbsp;For information about editing templates, see [Edit project templates](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/edit-templates.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit permissions to a project</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
