# Update project owners and sponsors

When you create a project in Adobe Workfront, you are automatically set as the Project&nbsp;Owner of the project. You can update this field with another user. You can also update the Project Sponsor field of a project.

For information about projects owners and sponsors, see [Overview of project owners and sponsors](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-owners-and-sponsors.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>You can identify an owner and a sponsor for a template. When you create a project from that template, the Template Owner becomes the Project Owner and the Template Sponsor becomes the Project Sponsor.&nbsp;For information about editing templates, see [Edit project templates](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/edit-templates.md).

## Access requirements
