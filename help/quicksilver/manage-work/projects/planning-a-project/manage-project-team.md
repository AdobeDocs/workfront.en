*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Add users to a Project Team

When you add users to the project team, they gain View permissions on the project and the tasks, issues, and documents of the project. For more information, see the article [Project Team overview](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-team-overview.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>Users on the Project Team are not automatically added to the resource management tools for the project.

You can add users to the project team in the following ways:

* [Automatically add users to a Project Team](#automatically-add-users-to-a-project-team) 
* [Manually add users to a Project Team](#manually-add-users-to-a-project-team)

### Automatically add users to a Project Team {#automatically-add-users-to-a-project-team}

The users that fulfill the following roles on the project are automatically added to the project team and appear  in the People section when the project is created:

* The creator of the project
* The project owner
* The project sponsor

Users are also automatically added to the project team when they are assigned to the following:

* Tasks
* Issues

### Manually add users to a Project Team {#manually-add-users-to-a-project-team}

If users that don't fulfill any role on the project want to be notified about certain updates or changes during the life of the project, you can manually add them to the project team. 

 For more information about what notifications can be enabled for users on the project team, see [Event notifications available in Adobe Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/event-notifications-available-in-wf.md). 

 <!--drafted - this used to be the case, in the note below but this limitation was removed on Jan 5, 2023 - as a patch, not a release feature:

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You can add to the Project Team only users that belong to the Group associated with the project. You cannot add users that belong to the Subgroups of the project's group. 

-->

1. Go to the project you want to add users to. 

1. Click **People** in the left panel. You might need to click **Show More** first.

1. Click **Add users**. 

   The Add users to Project Team dialog box displays.

   ![add_users_dialog.png](assets/add-users-dialog-350x217.png)

1. In the **Add users** box, begin typing the name of an active Workfront user that you want to add to the project team, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.

   Repeat this step to add multiple users to the project team. The users must belong to the group associated with the project. 

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >* You cannot add users by adding their teams, groups, companies, or job roles.
   >* As you add the users, notice the avatar, the user's Primary Role, and their email address to distinguish between users with identical names. Users must be associated with at least one job role to view it as you add them.
   >
   >  You must have the View Contact Info setting enabled in your access level for Users to view users' emails. For information, see [Grant access to users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-other-users.md).


1. Click **Add**.

   The users gain View permissions to the project and receive notifications about the project as part of the project team.

## Remove users from a Project Team

When you remove users from their roles on the project, they remain part of the project team.

If you remove a user from the project team and the user is assigned to tasks or issues in the project, the user is unassigned from the tasks and issues that are not completed. In this case, the tasks and issues return to the Unassigned Work area in the Workload Balancer. 

Users who are assigned to completed tasks and issues remain assigned even after you remove them from the project team. 

For more information about removing users from the project team, see [Remove users from projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/remove-users-from-projects.md).
