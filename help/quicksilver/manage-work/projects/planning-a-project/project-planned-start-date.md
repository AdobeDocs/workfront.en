The Planned Start and the Planned Completion Dates of a project rely on the dates of the tasks on the project. This article describes the Planned Start Date of a project. For information about the task Planned Start Date, see [Overview of the task Planned Start Date](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/task-planned-start-date.md).

The Planned Start Date of a project can be set manually or automatically, depending on whether you schedule the project from the Start or from the Completion Date. 

## Manually set the Planned Start Date of a project

You must manually set the Planned Start Date of a project when you schedule the project from Start Date. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you manually set the Planned Start Date of a project, Workfront automatically calculates the Planned Completion Date of the project based on the Duration of all the tasks. 

For information about setting the project's Planned Start Date, see [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

## Automatically set the Planned Start Date of a project

The Planned Start Date of a project is automatically set when you create the project in the following ways:

* from scratch and when you schedule the project from Completion Date.

  The Planned Start Date is automatically calculated by Adobe Workfront, based on the date you select for the Completion Date and the durations of all the tasks on the project.

  For information about creating a project from scratch, see [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md). 

* import it from Microsoft Project.

  The Planned Start Date is the Start Date of the project in Microsoft Project.

  For information about importing a project from Microsoft Project, see [Import a project from Microsoft Project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/import-project-from-ms-project.md).

* import it using Workfront Kick-Starts, when you are a Workfront administrator.

  The Planned Start Date always matches your computer's time and date, unless you specify otherwise in the setPlannedStartDate field on the Project sheet of the kick-start file.

  For information about importing data using kick-starts, see [Import data into Adobe Workfront using a Kick-Start template](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/using-kick-starts/import-data-via-kickstarts.md).

  For information about importing projects using kick-starts, see [Kick-Starts scenario: simple project and task import preparation](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/using-kick-starts/kick-starts-scenario-simple-project-task-import-prep.md).

## The Planned Start Date of a task

You can either specify the Planned Start Date of a task, or you can leave it up to Workfront to calculate it depending on certain criteria.

For information about the Planned Start Date of a task, see [Overview of the task Planned Start Date](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/task-planned-start-date.md).

<p><strong>Manually set the Planned Start Date of a task</strong></p>
<p>Setting the Planned Start Date of a task depends on the type of Task Constraint you assign to the task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can manually set the Planned Start Date&nbsp;when creating a task, as described in&nbsp;the article <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-tasks-in-project.md" class="MCXref xref">Create tasks in a project</a>.</p>
<p>You can manually specify the Planned Start Date when you select any of the following Task Constraints:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How the Planned Start Date is calculated for a task</strong></p>
<p>When it is calculated automatically by the system, the following can influence the Planned Start Date of a task:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>The Start&nbsp;Date preference setting in the Tasks & Issues area in Setup</p> <p>Your Workfront or group administrator can determine whether a new task starts on the same date as the project's Planned Start&nbsp;Date or on the day you create the task.</p> <p>For information about Tasks &&nbsp;Issues preferences, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure system-wide task and issue preferences</a>.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Task Constraint</p> <p>For more information about Task Constraints, see the article <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/task-constraints/task-constraint-overview.md" class="MCXref xref">Task Constraint overview</a></p> </li>
<li> <p>Task predecessor relationship</p> <p>For more information about task predecessors, see the article <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/predecessors-overview.md" class="MCXref xref">Overview of task predecessors</a>.</p> </li>
<li>Project Start Date, when the project is scheduled from Start Date.</li>
<li> <p>The time off schedule of the Primary&nbsp;Assignee of the task. </p> <p>When the Primary Assignee has time off scheduled during the duration of the task, the planned dates of the task adjust accordingly when the <strong>Consider user time off in task durations</strong> setting is selected for the <strong>User Time Off</strong> field. New projects inherit this setting from the Project&nbsp;Preferences area, but you can edit the setting at the project level. </p> <p>For example, if a task with a Constraint of As Soon As Possible is scheduled to start on June 1 and complete on June 3, and the Primary Assignee has June 1 marked for Time-off, the task Planned Start Date becomes June 2. </p> <p>For information about the <strong>User Time Off</strong> preference, see the articles <span href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md"><a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure system-wide project preferences</a></span> and <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md" class="MCXref xref">Edit projects</a>.</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>When set automatically, the Planned Start Date&nbsp;is determined based on the following calculation:&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>Planned Start Date = Planned Completion Date - Task Duration</code> </p>
<p>For example, if your task has a Completion Date of September 16 and a duration of 10 days, the Planned Start Date is September 6.</p> <note type="note"> &nbsp;The Update Type for the project must also be&nbsp;set to 'Automatic and On Change' or 'Automatically' in order for the Planned Hours and Duration to be automatically&nbsp;adjusted.
<br>For more information about the Update Type, see the article
<a href="../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/select-project-update-type.md" class="MCXref xref">Select the project Update Type </a>.
