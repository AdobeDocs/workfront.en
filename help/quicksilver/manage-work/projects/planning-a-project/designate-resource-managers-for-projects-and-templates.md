# Designate Resource Managers for a project or template

<!--
<p This article might have to be deleted when the Resource Manager field/ requirement will be forever removed from the system; right now it's still a requirement for Scheduler - January 2023/p>
-->

<!-- remove Prod and Prev references with Prod release - Jan 2023-->

You can designate Resource Managers for a project to indicate who is responsible for managing resources on the project. This is an informational field and it is not connected to any resource management tools. 

<!-- drafted for res scheduling deprecation blurb for preview release
Designating Resource Managers for a project is a prerequisite for using the Scheduling tools in Adobe Workfront, in the Production environment.

## Considerations about Resource Managers

>[!NOTE]
>
>Resource Manager is not a job role; it is a field available on a project or a template that you can manually update.

* You can designate up to 30 users as Resource Managers for an individual project or template.

<!--
* In the Production environment,designating Resource Managers on projects is a prerequisite to allowing users to schedule resources for work on the project when using the Scheduling tools.

  For information about resource scheduling, see [Resource Scheduling](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/resource-scheduling-overview.md). 

  <span class="preview">Scheduling tools have been removed from the Preview environment.</span>

* Designating Resource Managers on projects is not a prerequisite to allowing users to schedule resources for work using the Workload Balancer.

  For information about the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md). 

 -->

* You cannot designate teams or groups as resource managers. You can only designate users as resource managers.

* The users that you designate as Resource Mangers on a project or template do not automatically become part of the Project Team.

  For information about project teams, see [Manage the Project Team](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/manage-project-team.md).

* You can designate Resource Managers for projects or for project templates. When you designate Resource Managers on a project template, any users you designate as Resource Managers on the template automatically become Resource Managers on any projects that are created using that template.
* You can view the Resource Manager field in the following areas:

   * When editing a project, as described in this article.
   * When editing a template, as described in this article.
   * When building project or template reports. For information about building reports, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md). 
   * When creating or customizing a project or template view for a list. For more information, see [Views overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/views-overview.md).

* You can quickly add or remove Resource Managers on multiple projects or templates by adding the Resource Manager field to a view of a list or a project and editing this field using in-line edit.

## Designate Resource Managers for a project

1. Do any of the following:

   *  To add Resource Managers to a single project, go to the project where you want to designate one or more resource managers, then click the **More menu** next to the project name, then **Edit .** 
   
   * To add Resource Managers to multiple projects simultaneously, navigate to a list of projects, select the projects where you want to designate one or more resource managers, then click **Edit**.

     Existing Resource Managers are not removed from the projects you are editing; any users you add in this way are added as Resources Managers on the project in addition to any existing Resource Managers.
   
   * To add Resource Managers to a new project, begin creating a new project.

     For information about creating a project, see [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).

1. In the **Overview** section on the Edit Project dialog box, click in the **Resource Manager** field.
1. Begin typing the name of the user who you want to add as a resource manager for the project, then click the name when it appears in the list.
