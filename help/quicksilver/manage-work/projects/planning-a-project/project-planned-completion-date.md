# Set the project Planned Completion Date

The Planned Completion Date of a project is the date by which the project is set to complete.

The Planned Start and the Planned Completion Dates of a project rely on the dates of the tasks on the project.&nbsp;This article describes how you can manually or automatically set the Planned Completion Date of a project.&nbsp;For more information about the Planned Completion Date of a task, see [Overview of the task Planned Completion Date](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/task-planned-completion-date.md).

The Planned Completion Date of a project can be set manually or automatically, depending on whether you schedule the project from the Start or from the Completion Date.&nbsp;

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to the project</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Manually set the Planned Completion Date of a project

You must manually set the Planned Completion Date of a project when you schedule the project from Completion Date.&nbsp;

To schedule a project from Completion Date:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click **Projects**. 

1. Click&nbsp;**New Project** then**New Project**.

   For more information about creating projects, see the article [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).

1. Select **Project Details** in the left panel, then click the **Edit Project** icon in the upper-right corner. 

1. In the **Schedule From** field, select **Completion Date**.

1. Specify the **Planned Completion Date** of the project.
1. Click **Save Changes**.

   As you start adding tasks to your project, the **Planned Start Date** of the project calculates based on the total Duration of all of the tasks.&nbsp;

## Automatically set the Planned Completion Date of a project

The Planned Completion Date of a project is automatically calculated by Adobe Workfront when you schedule the project from Start Date.&nbsp;

To schedule a project from Start Date:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click **Projects**. 

1. Click&nbsp;**New Project** then**New Project**.

   For more information about creating projects, see the article [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).

1. Select **Project Details** in the left panel, then click the **Edit Project** icon in the upper-right corner. 

1. In the **Schedule From** field, select **Start Date**.

1. Specify the **Planned Start Date** of the project.
1. Click **Save Changes**.

   As you start adding tasks to your project, the **Planned Completion Date** of the project calculates based on the total Duration of all of the tasks.&nbsp;

   For more information about Task Duration, see the article [Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type](../../../manage-work/tasks/taskdurtn/task-duration-and-duration-type.md).

   The Planned Completion Date of the project coincides, in this case, with the Planned Completion Date of the last task on the project.

<p>(NOTE: drafted because I created a new article, here: /Content/Manage work/Tasks/Task information/task-planned-completion-date.htm)</p>
<p>You can either specify the Planned Completion Date of a task, or you can leave it up to Workfront to calculate it depending on certain criteria.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Manually set the Planned Completion Date of a task</strong></p>
<p>Setting the Planned Completion Date of a task depends on the type of Task Constraint you assign to the task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can manually set the Planned Completion Date&nbsp;when creating a task, as described in&nbsp;the article <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-tasks-in-project.md" class="MCXref xref">Create tasks in a project</a>.</p>
<p>You can manually specify the Planned Completion Date when you select any of the following Task Constraints:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How the Planned Completion Date is calculated for a task</strong></p>
<p>When it is calculated automatically by the system, the following can influence the Planned Completion Date of a Task:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>Task Constraint</p> <p>For more information about Task Constraints, see the article <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/task-constraints/task-constraint-overview.md" class="MCXref xref">Task Constraint overview</a>.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Task predecessor relationship</p> <p>For more information about task predecessors, see the article <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/predecessors-overview.md" class="MCXref xref">Overview of task predecessors</a>.</p> </li>
<li>Project Completion Date, when the project is scheduled from Completion Date.</li>
<li> <p>The time off schedule of the Primary&nbsp;Assignee of the task. </p> <p>When the Primary Assignee has time off scheduled during the duration of the task, the planned dates of the task adjust accordingly when the <strong>Consider user time off in task durations</strong> setting is selected for the <strong>User Time Off</strong> field. New projects inherit this setting from the Project&nbsp;Preferences area, but you can edit the setting at the project level. </p> <p>For example, if a task with a Constraint of As Soon As Possible is scheduled to start on June 1 and complete on June 3, and the Primary Assignee has June 2 marked for Time-off, the task Planned Completion Date becomes June 4. </p> <p>For information about the <strong>User Time Off</strong> preference, see the articles <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure system-wide project preferences</a> or <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md" class="MCXref xref">Edit projects</a>.</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>When set automatically, the Planned Completion Date&nbsp;is determined based on the following calculation:&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>Planned Completion Date = Planned Start Date + Duration</code> </p>
<p>For example, if your task has a start date of September 16 and a duration of 10 days, the Planned Completion Date is September 26.</p> <note type="note">
&nbsp;The Update Type for the project must also be&nbsp;set to Automatic and On Change or Automatically in order for the Planned Hours and Duration to be automatically&nbsp;adjusted.
<br>For more information about the Update Type, see the article
<a href="../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/select-project-update-type.md" class="MCXref xref">Select the project Update Type </a>.
