## Issue statuses

The following are the default statuses for issues in Workfront:

* New
* In Progress
* Awaiting Feedback
* On Hold
* Won't Resolve
* Reopened
* Closed
* Resolved

Your Adobe Workfront administrator can add custom statuses for issues for your organization. They can also make statuses available depending on the issue type.

For more information about custom statuses and issue types, see the following articles:

* [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md) 
* [Create issues](../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/create-issues.md)

You can manually update issue statuses or you can let Workfront automatically update them when certain actions take place.

## Manually update issue status

You can update the issue status in the following areas of Workfront:

* The issue header on the task page.
* The Edit issue box, when editing an issue.
* The Details section on the issue page. 
* In an issue list or report, when the Status field is visible in the view. 
* In the Summary panel of the issue. 

To manually update the issue status in the issue header: 

1. Go to an issue for which you want to update the status.
1. Click the **Status** field in the issue header and select a new status. 
1. To provide a visual indication of issue completion, drag or double-click the bubble under **Percent Complete** in the header of the issue

   Or

   Click inside the bubble in the header of the issue to enter a percentage.

1. (Optional) Do any of the following to provide additional information about the update:

   * To add a note about the update, go to the **Updates** section and click **New comment**, then type a note.

   * To notify certain users about the update, type their names in the **Tag people or teams** field that appears when you type a comment. For more information, see [Tag others on updates](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md). 
   * To update the Commit Date of the issue, click **Issue Details**, then edit the **Commit Date** field. For information, see [Edit issues](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/issues/manage-issues/edit-issues.md).
