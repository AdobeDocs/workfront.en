# Update task status

<!--Audited: 10/2024-->

You can update a task's status to inform others about where the task is (and the overall project) and how it is progressing.

The default statuses are New, In Progress, and Complete. Your Adobe Workfront administrator can add custom statuses for your organization. For more information, see [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).

You can manually update task statuses or you can let Workfront automatically update them when certain actions take place.

## Access requirements

## Considerations about updating the Status of tasks

* When you mark a task as Complete, the percent complete of the task updates to 100%. 
* The following scenarios exist for parent tasks: 
  * You cannot update the Status of a parent task to Complete when the Summary Completion Mode of the project is set to Automatic and the subtasks are not completed.
  * You can update the Status of a parent task to Complete when the Summary Completion Mode of the project is set to Manual and the subtasks are completed or incomplete. 

  For more information, see [Edit projects](../manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

## Manually update task status

You can update the task status in the following areas of Workfront:

* The task header on the task page.
* The Edit task box, when editing a task.
* The Task Details section on the task page. 
* In a task list or report, when the Status field is visible in the view. 
* In the Summary panel of the task. 

To manually update the task status in the task header: 

1. Go to an task for which you want to update the status.
1. Click the **Status** field in the task header and select a new status. 
1. To provide a visual indication of task completion, drag or double-click the bubble under **Percent Complete** in the header of the task

   Or

   Click inside the bubble in the header of the task to enter a percentage.

## Automatically update task status

Workfront automatically updates the existing status of a task to a different status when the actions listed in the table below occur.

>The statuses in the following table are default system statuses. Your Workfront administrator or a group administrator can rename the statuses in your instance of Workfront. For information about creating and managing statuses in Workfront, see [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).
