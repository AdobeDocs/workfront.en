# How Financial Recalculation is Triggered

The following actions trigger financial recalculation in Workfront:

* Changing task status
* Moving a task with hours to another project
* Changing the project status from Complete to an active status

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you change the project status, only the planned values are being recalculated.

You can also recalculate finances manually under the **More** menu ![](assets/qs-more-menu.png) at the project level, by clicking **Recalculate Finances**.
