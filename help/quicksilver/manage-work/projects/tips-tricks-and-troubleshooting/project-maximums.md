# Project limits overview

Project maximums are in place to improve product performance and enhance your experience with Adobe Workfront. The following project components have maximums:

## Tasks

The maximum number of tasks per project is 5,000. A warning message displays when the number of tasks approaches this maximum. When the maximum is reached, an error message displays and additional tasks cannot be added to the project.

To avoid reaching this maximum, move tasks that are closed to another project designated for closed tasks. Reports on these projects may need to be adjusted.

## Issues

The maximum number of issues per project is 10,000. A warning message displays when the number of issues approaches this maximum. When the maximum is reached, an error message displays and additional issues cannot be added to the project.

To avoid reaching this maximum, move issues that are closed to another project designated for closed issues. Reports on these projects may need to be adjusted.

## Duration

The maximum duration of a project must be 15 years for Workfront to automatically calculate its timeline. A warning message displays when the project duration approaches the maximum. When the maximum is reached, a warning message displays and the automatic timeline calculations no longer occurs.

The automatic timeline calculations will resume as soon as a project's duration is reduced below 15 years by adjusting the dates of the tasks in the project.

## Timeline Calculations

Workfront does not perform automatic timeline calculations for projects that haven't been updated in 6 months and will not resume until an update is made.

For projects that haven't been updated in 3 months, Workfront performs timeline calculations weekly instead of nightly.

For information about calculating project timeline, see [Recalculate project timelines](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/recalculate-project-timeline.md).
