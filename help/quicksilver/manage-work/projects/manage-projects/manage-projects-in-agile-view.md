# Manage a project in the Agile View

<!-- Audited: 2/2024 -->

You can leverage agile functionality for your project without the administrative challenges that typically accompany agile practices (such as managing a team backlog or creating iterations).

If you want to work in an agile environment that uses a team backlog and allows you to create iterations from tasks on the backlog, follow the instructions in [Work in an agile environment](../../../agile/work-in-an-agile-environment/work-in-an-agile-environment.md).

## Access requirements

+++ Expand to view access requirements for the functionality in this article.

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">
