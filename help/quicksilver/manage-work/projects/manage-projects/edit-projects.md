You can edit a project in Adobe Workfront as often as needed. We recommend that you edit projects minimally after their status changes to Current, to avoid confusion by sending out notifications about the changes to the entire project team. 

Ideally, you should edit a project when the project is in the Planning status. For information about the project team, see [Project Team overview](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-team-overview.md).

## Limitations for editing projects

There are some limitations that might prevent you from editing projects.

Consider the following when editing projects:

* You cannot edit projects that are in an Approval Process, except for logging time and changing the Status. 
* You can attach documents or templates to a project that has a status of Complete, Dead, or is in Pending Approval only if your Workfront administrator or a group administrator enabled this functionality in the Project Preferences area. For information about setting project preferences, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md). 
* You can only edit the following information on a project in a Dead or Complete status:

   * Modify existing expenses.
   * Add, remove, or edit custom forms.

## Edit a project

By editing a project you can modify information and settings for the project, as well as tasks and issues on the project.

Some settings mentioned in this article might be modified from their default status by their state in the template from which the project was created. 

For information about editing templates, see [Edit project templates](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/edit-templates.md).

1. (Optional) Continue editing the following sections, depending on the information you want to modify.

   Or

   Click **Save**.

### Task Settings {#task-settings}

You can define the defaults that will be associated with all the new tasks when you add them to the project.

For information about how these settings affect creating new tasks, see the section [Task defaults when adding tasks to a project](../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-tasks-overview.md#understa) in the article [Create tasks overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-tasks-overview.md).

1. Begin editing your project as described above.
1. Click **Task Settings** in the left panel.

   ![](assets/nwe-task-settings-in-edit-project-box-350x211.png)

1. In the **Task Default Approval Process** box, select the task Approval Process you want to associate with all new tasks when you add them to the project.

   Your Workfront administrator (or a user with administrative access to Approval processes) must create a system-level or group-level approval process for a task before you can associate it with a project. Only active approval processes display in the list. For information about creating Approval Processes, see [Create an approval process for work items](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/configure-approval-milestone-processes/create-approval-processes.md). For information about how changes to the group of the project or changes in the approval process affect approval settings, see [How group and approval process changes affect assigned approval processes](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/configure-approval-milestone-processes/how-changes-affect-group-approvals.md).

   When bulk-editing projects, the following scenarios exist:

   * When you select multiple projects from the same group, both system-level and group-specific task approval processes display in this field.
   * When you select multiple projects from different groups, only system-level task approval processes display in this field.

1. In the **Task Default Custom Forms** box, select the custom form or forms that you want to associate with all new tasks when you add them to the project. You must build the custom forms before they are available to select in this field. Only active custom forms display in the list. For more information about building custom forms, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md). You can associate up to ten custom forms with a task.
1. (Optional) Select **Use Work Effort to automatically calculate task Planned Hours** if you want to enable managing task effort by using Work Effort instead of Planned Hours.

   ![](assets/nwe-work-effort-on-projects-350x182.png)

1. (Conditional and optional) If you selected Use Work Effort to automatically calculate task Planned Hours, click the drop-down menu for each level of effort and select a percentage for each level. The following percentage values are defaults:

   | Size |Percentage |
   |---|---|
   | Small |25% |
   | Medium |50% |
   | Large |75% |

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >When the project Update Type is set to Automatic and you select this setting, the Planned Hours of the tasks update according to the task Duration and the Work Effort percentage, if they are set to zero. For more information about using Work Effort to plan effort for a task, see [Work Effort overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/work-effort.md).

1. (Optional) Continue editing the following sections, depending on the information you want to modify.

### Issue Settings {#issue-settings}

1. Begin editing your project as described above.
1. Click **Issue Settings** in the left panel.

   ![](assets/nwe-issue-settings-in-edit-project-box-350x306.png)

1. (Optional) Deselect the **Allow users to add issues inline** option. It is selected by default.

   When deselecting this option users cannot add issues inline to the project or the tasks in the Issues section.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Deselect this option if you want to enforce users to complete the New Issue Fields or the custom forms associated with new issues. Enabling users to enter issues inline allows them to bypass the New Issue fields and custom forms when creating issues. For information about setting fields and custom forms for new issues, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

   When deselecting this option, users with permissions to add issues to the project or the tasks can do so in the following ways:

   * Click New Issue at the top of the list of issues in the Issues section of the project or of the tasks. 
   * When the project is configured as a request queue, they can enter a new request in the Requests area.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When editing projects in bulk this setting is enabled if at least one project has it enabled and it is disabled if all selected projects have it disabled.

   <!--drafted for bulk edit projects: the statement above needs to be corrected when the new UI for bulk edit projects is updated; not sure if we'll need to describe this at all or we can cover this in  a "Considerations" mini section inside the Editing in bulk section below- ??? -->

### Linked folders (conditional availability)

Linked folder functionality automatically creates folders in Adobe Experience Manager Assets, and connects these folders to Workfront. 

This section appears only if all of the following apply:

* Your organization has been migrated to the Adobe Admin Console
* Your organization has enabled and configured an integration with Adobe Experience Manager
* The template used to create this project has enabled and configured linked folders.

For instructions on editing Linked folders, see [Edit workflow values in a project](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/use-aem-workflows.md#edit-workflow-values-in-a-project) in the article [Use workflows in the Experience Manager Assets integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/use-aem-workflows.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because linked folders are created when the project is created, editing the linked folder workflow on an existing project is ineffective. Editing these values when creating a project functions as expected.

## Edit a project in the project header (limited)

You can edit a limited amount of information in the project header.

Your system or group administrator can customize the fields you see in the project header. 

![](assets/project-header-350x18.png)

The following fields are included in the project header, by default.

* Project name
* Percent Complete
* Project Owner
* Planned Completion Date and time

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >You can edit this field only when the project is scheduled from Completion Date. When the project is scheduled from Start Date, Workfront calculates the Planned Completion Date and time based on the duration of the tasks.

* Condition

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >You can edit this field only when the Condition Type of the project is Manual. When the Condition Type is set to Progress Status, Workfront calculates the condition based on the progress of the tasks. For information, see [Overview of Project Condition and Condition Type](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/project-condition-and-condition-type.md).

* Status
* Make approval decisions if you are set as the approver in a current approval process

## Edit projects in bulk

You can edit projects in bulk and update information for all selected projects at the same time.

Consider the following when editing projects in bulk:

* The information you are changing on all the projects selected overwrites the existing information on individual projects, except for the Resource Manager field. 

   Adding a new resource manager when editing projects in bulk adds that manager to all the selected projects. If other resource managers are associated with the selected projects, they remain on the projects in addition to the one added through bulk edit.

* When you select projects that have different values for the same field, the field displays a "Multiple values" indicator in the Edit projects box. Fields that are checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles have a "Multiple values" indicator next to them.

   ![](assets/multiple-values-indicator-dates-bulk-edit-projects.png)

* In addition to the "Multiple values" indicator, when the chosen options are different on at least one of the selected projects, fields that have multiple options display in one of the following ways:  

    * Checkbox fields have a line instead of a checkbox for the option that is checked for some but not for all the selected projects.

      ![](assets/multiple-values-indicator-check-boxes-bulk-edit-projects.png)

    * Toggle-type fields display dimmed, with the toggle in the middle for the option that is enabled for some but not for all the selected projects. 

    ![](assets/multiple-values-highlighted-bulk-edit-projects.png)

    * Radio button-type fields that have some options selected but not all, display all radio buttons as empty. 

      ![](assets/multiple-values-indicator-radio-buttons-bulk-edit-projects.png)

* When you update one option in a multiple-option field (such as a field that displays as a set of toggles or checkboxes), all other options must match between the selected projects. 

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >For example, you might have a checkbox field with three checkboxes (Option1, Option 2, and Option 3) and Option 1 is unchecked for all projects, and Option 2 and 3 are checked for some and unchecked for other projects that you selected. If you want to check Option 1 for all projects, you must also make Option 2 and 3 match for all the selected projects before you can save your changes, so you must either select them or deselect them so that they can match on all the selected projects. If you do not change any of the options, you can save the field as is, and the projects maintain their current selection for all options. 

* When you select multiple projects that belong to different groups, the statuses that display in the Status field are system-level statuses and not group-level statuses.
