# Project limits overview

Adobe Workfront has limits for how many objects can be associated with a project. Project limits are in place to improve product performance and enhance your experience with Workfront.

The following objects associated with projects have the following limits:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Tasks</td> 
   <td> <!--
     <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(This is NOT TRUE, but the PMs always wanted this to stay the way it is because they don't want customers creating projects bigger than this.)</p>
    --> <p>The maximum number of tasks per project is 5,000. A warning message displays when the number of tasks approaches this maximum. When the maximum is reached, an error message displays and additional tasks cannot be added to the project.</p> <p>To avoid reaching this maximum, move tasks that are closed to another project designated for closed tasks. Reports on these projects may need to be adjusted.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Issues</td> 
   <td> <!--
     <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(this is true only for some clusters; according to Anna A., some clusters are set to a million.)</p>
    --> <p>The maximum number of issues per project is 10,000. A warning message displays when the number of issues approaches this maximum. When the maximum is reached, an error message displays and additional issues cannot be added to the project.</p> <p>To avoid reaching this maximum, move issues that are closed to another project designated for closed issues. Reports on these projects may need to be adjusted.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Durations</td> 
   <td> <p>The maximum duration of a project must be 15 years for Workfront to automatically calculate its timeline. A warning message displays when the project duration approaches the maximum. When the maximum is reached, a warning message displays and the automatic timeline calculations no longer occurs.</p> <p>The automatic timeline calculations will resume as soon as a project's duration is reduced below 15 years by adjusting the dates of the tasks in the project.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Timeline calculations</td> 
   <td>Workfront does not perform automatic timeline calculations for projects that haven't been updated in 6 months and will not resume until an update is made.<p>For projects that haven't been updated in 3 months, Workfront performs timeline calculations weekly instead of nightly.</p><p>For information about calculating project timeline, see <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/recalculate-project-timeline.md" class="MCXref xref">Recalculate project timelines</a>. </p></td>
