# Set the Condition Type of a project

As a project manager, you can determine how the&nbsp;Condition of a project is calculated by updating the Condition&nbsp;Type of the project. The project Condition is a visual representation of how the project is progressing.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information about access to projects, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-projects.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to projects</a>. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p>Contribute permissions to a project to edit the Condition&nbsp;Type in the Project Details area </p> </li> 
     <li> <p>Manage permissions to a project to edit the Condition&nbsp;Type in the Edit Project box</p> </li> 
    </ul> <p> For information about project permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-project.md" class="MCXref xref">Share a project in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr>

1. Do one of the following:&nbsp;

   ![](assets/update-condition-type-nwe-350x108.png)

1. In the **Condition Type** field, choose one of the following:

   * **Manual:** The project owner sets the Condition on the project manually.

     In this case, the project owner can update the Condition of the project in the project header, or the Project Details section. 
   
   * **Progress Status:** Workfront sets the Condition based on the Progress Status of the project. For information about how the Progress Status is calculated, see [Project Progress Status overview](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-progress-status.md).

1. Click&nbsp;**Save** when you modify the&nbsp;Condition&nbsp;Type in the Edit Project box.

   Click&nbsp;**Save Changes** when you modify the Condition&nbsp;Type in the Project Details section.
