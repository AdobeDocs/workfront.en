# Summarize projects with AI Assistant

Workfront's AI Assistant can summarize projects, allowing you to quickly understand project information, such as project purpose and status, gives examples of tasks that are completed and that are still pending, and provides some additional details and notes.

You can use the Project Summary button to generate a summary, or you can enter a prompt into AI Assistant.
