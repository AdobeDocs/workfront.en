# Require time to be approved for a project

<!--audited: 08/2024-->

You can configure the project to require that the hours logged against the project are approved by the Project Owner. When configured in this way, hours must be first approved by the Project Owner before they can be eligible to be used on a billing record.   
For more information about billing records, see the article [Create billing records](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/create-billing-records.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Enabling this option does not remove a timesheet approver's ability to approve time on the timesheet. If the Project Owner doesn't approve or reject time, a timesheet approver can still approve the time on a timesheet.

## Require time to be approved for a project

To require project manager approval for hours on the project:

1. Go to the project where you want to require approval for hours.
1. Click the **More** icon ![More icon](assets/more-icon.png) to the right of the project name, then click **Edit**.  
   The Edit Project dialog box displays.

1. In the **Project Settings** section, select **Require time to be approved for this project**. 
1. Click **Save**.  
   Now when time is logged and approved, those hours become locked and cannot be altered by the user who entered them on the project or the timesheet. Only a Workfront administrator can adjust the time recorded.

## Approve and reject time on a project

As a project manager, you can approve or reject hours that are logged for tasks, issues, or the project.

Approving the hours at the project level does not have any impact on the timesheet of any of the users who logged the hours. For example, the hours in the project may be approved by the project manager, but the timesheet is still yet to be approved by the manager of the user or the timesheet approver. 

If you set up a project to require approval on the hours logged, the project manager must approve the hours in order for them to be available to be included in a billing record for the project. For more information about creating billing records, see the article [Create billing records](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/create-billing-records.md).

To approve or reject hours on a project:

1. Go to the project.
1. Click the **Hours** area in the left panel.  

1. The hours logged for issues, tasks, and the project display and should have a status of **Submitted**.  
   Click the box to the left of the hour entries to select the hours you want to approve.

1. Click the **Approve** icon ![](assets/approve-hours-icon.png) at the top of the hour list.  
   The status of the hours changes to **Approved**.  
   If you later reject the approved hours, the status of the hours changes to **Not Approved**.  
   When you include the approved hours in a billing record, the status of the hours changes to **Billed and Approved**. Hours added to a billing record cannot be deleted. For more information about creating billing records, see the article [Create billing records](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/create-billing-records.md)

1. (Optional) Click **Reject** icon ![](assets/reject-hours-icon.png) to reject the time entries on the project.  
   The status of the hours changes to **Rejected**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >   If the hours you select are included in a Billing Record that has been marked as Billed or Billed and Approved, the Approve and Reject icons do not display. You can only approve hours that are not already billed in a Billing Record.
