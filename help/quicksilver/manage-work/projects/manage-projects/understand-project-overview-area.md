# Manage information in the project Overview area

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: some information in here is duplicated in Edit projects. If you need to update one of the fields in this area, do it in both places.)</p>
-->

You can view or edit the information of a project by accessing the Overview area of the Project Details section. There is a limited number of fields that you can view or edit in this area. For information about editing all information for a project see [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Review or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access to Projects or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions to the project or higher</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Access the Overview section

1. Go to the project whose Overview section you want to view.
1. Click **Project Details** in the left panel. 
1. The **Overview** section should display first as part of the Project&nbsp;Details and should be expanded by default

   Or

   Click the **Edit** icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of the Details section, ``` then click **Overview**```. This opens the Overview area for editing.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Depending on how your Workfront administrator configured your Layout Template, the Overview section might not be listed first, in which case it is collapsed. For information, see [Customize the Details view using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-details-view-layout-template.md).

1. (Conditional) If there is a specific field that needs to be updated on a project but is not displayed in this section, click &nbsp;the **More menu** ![](assets/more-icon.png) next to the project name, then **Edit** to view more project fields.

   For more information about editing projects, see [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

1. If your company has purchased an additional license for the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner, and the project has information published from a linked initiative, review the following initiative information in the Scenario Planner area:

   <table> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><span>Initiative Duration</span> </td>

       <ul> 
        <li>Job&nbsp;Role name</li> 
        <li>Number of FTEs</li> 
        <li> <p>Number of Hours for all&nbsp;FTEs</p> <p>You can estimate the amount of job roles needed for your plan or initiative using hours or FTEs.&nbsp;</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="../../../scenario-planner/create-and-edit-plans.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and edit plans in the Scenario Planner</a>. </p> </li> 
       </ul> <p>Tip: <span>If the number of job role is different for each month in the initiative, this field displays the maximum amount of roles needed for the initiative. For example, if you need 1 Consultant for January and 2 for February, the column displays 2FTE and the corresponding amount of hours for 2 FTEs for all months.</span> </p> </td>
