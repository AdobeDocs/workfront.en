# Schedule resources for a project

You can schedule resources for a single project to indicate what work each resource is assigned to as well as how much time they should spend completing their work. You can schedule resources for a project and allocate hours to each resource using the Scheduling tool or the Workload Balancer at the project level.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:
