# Project dates overview

Adobe Workfront associates projects with multiple dates fields. This article documents all the built-in date fields and fields that contribute to updating dates for projects. 

The following sections list date fields associated with projects, in alphabetical order. 

## Actual Completion Date

The Actual Completion Date is the date when the project is marked as Complete. 

A project has the Actual Completion Date populated in the following ways:

* When a user manually updates it. This is possible only when the project's Completion Mode is set to Manual.
* When the project Status is marked as Complete. 

## Actual Duration

## Actual Start Date

The Actual Start Date is the date when a user starts working on the first task of a project.

A project has the Actual Start Date populated when the Status of the first task on the project is marked as In Progress.

## Approval Path Completion Date

The Approval Path Completion Date is the date when the approval of a project was granted and the Status of the project was changed. 

## Approval Path Start Date

The Approval Path Start Date is the date when the project Status changed to "Pending approval" and the project approval request was sent to the approvers. 

## Budgeted Completion Date

This is a deprecated field. Any information that this field might display is related to a feature that Workfront has removed. This field cannot be updated.

This field is still visible in project and tasks reports and lists.

## Converted Issue Entry Date

The date when the issue that was converted to the project was created. 

## Due On

The same date as the project's Planned Completion Date. This is the date by which the projects is expected to be completed.

## Duration

For projects, the Duration is a calculation performed by Workfront and it represents the difference in days between the Planned Start of the earliest task and the Planned Completion of the latest task on the project.
