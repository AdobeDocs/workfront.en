# Save a project as a template

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: Keep this the way it is in the Managing Projects area because the functionality in the UI is "Save as template" at the project level, so users see that in the UI; there is another article that this links to which is more in depth (step-by-step). This functionality needs to stay in both projects AND templates areas.)</p>

If you decide that a project is going to occur again sometime in the future, you can create a template from that existing project. Then, you can use the template again, to create future projects that might contain similar information or might share the same timeline or assignments with the existing project.

## Access requirements

## Save a project as a template

1. Go to the project that you want to save as a template. 
1. Click the **More** menu ![More icon](assets/qs-more-icon-on-an-object.png), then **Save as Template**. 
1. Specify the following information for the template:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
      <td>Specify a name for the template.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Description</td> 
      <td>Provide a description for the template.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Is Active</td> 
      <td> <p>Select from the following options:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> <p><strong>Yes</strong>: Other users can find the template and attach it to projects.</p> </li> 
        <li><strong>No</strong>: Other users cannot find the template and cannot attach it to projects.</li> 
       </ul> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Custom Forms</td> 
      <td>Use the drop-down list to select any custom forms to attach to the template. If any custom forms have already been associated with the project, all of the data fields from those custom forms are displayed.<br>You can include up to 10 custom forms on a single template.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **Manage Forms** to remove or reorder the forms. For information about how to remove and reorder custom forms on the template, see [Custom forms](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-and-manage-custom-forms.md).
