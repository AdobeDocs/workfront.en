# Overview of project metrics

Project metrics give you a general view in chart format about how your project is performing.

## Access requirements

For information about access to projects, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-projects.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to projects</a>. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>. </p> </td>

*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

To access the Metrics area from the left panel of a project, you must:

* Have the Left panel option Metrics enabled in the Projects area of your Layout Template.  

  To learn how a Workfront administrator or group administrator can customize the left panel with a Layout Template, see [Customize the left panel using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-left-panel.md).  

## Overview of the project Metrics area

Project metrics give you a visualization of what is happening in a project, allowing you quickly assess the needs and status of a project.

![](assets/project-metrics-full-screen-350x238.png)

In the Metrics area, you can see the overall health of a project, as well as:

* Where work is active or stalled
* Who has open work items assigned to them
* Details on tasks or issues that are overdue or close to the Planned Completion Date

You can also drill in to each chart to look more closely at tasks or issues in a specific category.

To learn more about looking at these tasks or issues, see [View Metrics details](#view-metrics-details).

>To see metrics at a higher level for a group of projects within a program, portfolio, etc., navigate to the Enhanced analytics area.  
>To learn more about Enhanced analytics, see [Enhanced analytics overview](../../../enhanced-analytics/enhanced-analytics-overview.md).

## Project KPIs

Key performance indicators (KPIs) display at the top of the Metrics area.

![](assets/project-metrics-kpis-350x52.png)

These KPIs are broken down into the following categories:

| Completed tasks |**Completed tasks** shows the number of tasks in a Complete status. This number also includes tasks that have a custom status that equates with Complete. |
|---|---|
| Incomplete tasks |**Incomplete tasks** shows the number of tasks that are not in a Complete or Closed status or a status that equates with Complete. |
| Overdue tasks |**Overdue tasks** shows the number of tasks that are past the Planned Completion Date and are not in a Complete or Closed status or a status that equates with Complete or Closed. |
| Total tasks |**Total tasks** shows the total number of tasks in the project. |

## Task or issue bar chart

In the bar chart that appears below the project KPIs, you can look at the status or priority of work items in the project. The task view is selected by default.

When status is selected in this chart, you can view all statuses of tasks or issues in a project. Each status is grouped into a bar in the chart. All default system statuses and custom statuses display in this chart.

![](assets/project-metrics-task-issue-by-status-350x120.png)

When priority is selected in this chart, you can view all priorities of tasks or issues in a project.

## Donut chart

The donut chart located below the project KPIs allows you to look at the ratio of completed work items vs. incomplete work items in a project.

![](assets/tasks-issues-by-complete-status-350x250.png)

In the drop-down menu above the chart, you can select:

| All tasks |Selecting **tasks** shows you the total number of tasks in the project, as well as the ratio between completed and incomplete tasks. |
|---|---|
| All issues |Selecting **issues** shows you the total number of issues in the project, as well as the ratio between completed and incomplete issues. |

The assignee bar chart shows you the number of tasks assigned to each person in the project. This number varies based on the category you select from the drop-down menu.

![](assets/tasks-issues-by-assignee-350x104.png)

You can choose to look at task assignments for a project in the following categories:

| Complete |Selecting **Complete** shows the number of tasks assigned to each user that have been completed. |
|---|---|
| Incomplete |Selecting **Incomplete** shows the number of tasks assigned to each user that have not been completed yet. |
