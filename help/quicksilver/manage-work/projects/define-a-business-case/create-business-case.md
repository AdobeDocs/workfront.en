# Create a Business Case for a project

You can use the Business Case to request a project and define the purpose, the budget, and the potential benefit for the project. The Portfolio Manager or Project Sponsor uses the information from the Business Case to analyze and prioritize the project before they approve it.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Projects, Financial Data, and Resource Management</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage or higher permissions on the project</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

Consider the following when requesting a project through a Business Case:

* Your Adobe Workfront administrator or group administrator must enable the sections of the Business Case before they appear on your project.  
  For information about enabling the sections in the Business Case at the system level, see the article [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

  For information about the areas of the Business Case, see the article [Overview of the Areas of the Business Case](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/areas-of-business-case.md).

* You must complete all areas of the Business Case except for the Goals area if you want your project to receive a Score in the Portfolio Optimizer. Completing the Goals area is optional. The project receives a Score in the Portfolio Optimizer, even if this area is not completed.

  For information about working with Scorecards and with the Portfolio Optimizer, see the article [Apply a scorecard to a project and generate an Alignment Score](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/apply-scorecard-to-project-to-generate-alignment-score.md).
