# Create Business Case goals

As part of creating a Business Case, you can create a set of goals to define the objectives of a project. Business Case goals are used to communicate to the Portfolio Manager or the Project Sponsor the purpose of completing a project.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can create strategic goals for your organization that are not connected to a project's individual Business Case. You must have access to&nbsp;Adobe Workfront Goals to be able to create strategic goals. You can then connect them with projects outside of their Business Cases. For information about creating goals using Workfront Goals, see [Adobe Workfront Goals overview](../../../workfront-goals/goal-management/wf-goals-overview.md).

Consider the following when creating Business Case goals for your projects:

* Business Case goals are project-specific. You cannot copy goals from one project to another, nor establish goals at the system level. They must be defined at the level of each project. 
* Your Adobe Workfront administrator or group administrator must enable the Goals section for your projects before it displays in the Business Case of your projects. For information about enabling Business Case fields for projects, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

* Goals are not a mandatory section in the Business Case of a project.

  A project can receive a score to be prioritized in the Portfolio Optimizer, even if the Goals section of the Business Case is not defined.

  For more information about the Portfolio Optimizer score, see [Apply a scorecard to a project and generate an Alignment Score](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/apply-scorecard-to-project-to-generate-alignment-score.md).

* You cannot report on Business&nbsp;Case&nbsp;goals.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions or higher to the project</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
