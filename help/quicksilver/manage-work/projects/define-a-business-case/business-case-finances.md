# Overview of Business Case financial fields

The Business Case sub-tab includes financial fields for the project.&nbsp;In order for some of the financial fields to have values, corresponding areas of the Business Case must be completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The following project financial fields display in the Business Case:

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Net Value</td> 
   <td> <p>This is the total expected value of the project after calculating its benefit and removing the costs.</p> <p>The Net Value for the project is calculated by the following formula:<br></p> <p><code>Net Value = Planned Benefit - Budgeted Cost - Potential Risk</code>. <br></p> <p>For more information about calculating Net Value, see <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/calculate-net-value.md" class="MCXref xref">Calculate Net Value</a>.<br></p> <p>This field displays in the Business Case Summary area.</p> </td>

   <td>Planned Benefit</td> 
   <td>A manual estimate of the monetary benefit for your organization when this project is completed. It can be any amount of currency and it is specific to you and to each project you manage. The Planned Benefit cannot have a negative value. This field displays in the Business Case Summary area and it can be edited in the Project Info area of the Business Case. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Potential&nbsp;Cost of Risks</td> 
   <td> <p>This is the Potential Cost of all the risks on the project. </p> <p>This is calculated using the following formula:</p> <p><code>Potential Risk = SUM(Potential Cost * Probability of Risk) </code></p> <p>For more information about risks on the project, see&nbsp;<a href="../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-edit-risks-on-projects.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and edit risks on projects</a>.</p> <p>This field displays in the Business Case Summary area.</p> </td>

   <td>Potential Risk</td> 
   <td> <p>In the Business Case Summary, this is the amount of the cost of the all the risks if they should occur, based on their probability. For example, if a Risk has a Potential Cost of $100 and a Probability of occurring of 10%, the Potential&nbsp;Risk is $10. The Potential Risk in the Business Case Summary is calculated by the following formula:</p> <p><code>Potential&nbsp;Risk = SUM(Risk Potential Cost x Probability)</code> for all risks. </p> </td>
