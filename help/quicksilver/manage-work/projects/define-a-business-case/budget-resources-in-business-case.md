# Budget resources in the Business Case

As part of resource planning, you can budget the job roles necessary for completing the work in a project when you build the business case. For more information about creating a Business Case, see [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Budgeting resources is not the same as scheduling resources for a project. When you budget resources you estimate the roles that might be necessary to complete the work on a project. For actually scheduling or assigning users to the work on a project, see [Manage user allocations in the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/manage-user-allocations-workload-balancer.md)

You must associate job roles with the project before you can budget the resources for it. The following are ways of allocating job roles to a project:

* Use the Resource Planner to apply Resource Pools to the project and budget job roles.

  For more information, see [Budget resources in the Business Case using the Resource Planner](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/budget-resources-in-business-case-use-resource-planner.md). 

* Use the Scenario Planner to create initiatives with required job roles and link them to the project. For more information, see [Budget resources in the Business Case using the Scenario Planner](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/budget-resources-in-business-case-use-scenario-planner.md).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >The Scenario Planner is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience and requires an additional license. For information about the Workfront Scenario Planner, see [The Scenario Planner overview](../../../scenario-planner/scenario-planner-overview.md).
