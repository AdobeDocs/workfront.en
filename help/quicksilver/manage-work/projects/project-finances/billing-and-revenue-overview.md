# Overview of Billing and Revenue

As a project manager, you can use billing rates to capture revenue on your projects.

This article describes tracking revenue for projects. Revenue is calculated differently in the Utilization Report.&nbsp;For information on Revenue calculations in the Utilization Report, see [View resource utilization information](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-utilization/view-utilization-information.md).

## Billing Rates overview

Consider the following when working with billing rates:

* You need a Plan license with Edit access to Financial Data in order to manage billing rates.   
  For more information about granting access to Financial Data, see [Grant access to financial data](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-financial.md).

* Billing rates are amounts of revenue per work unit associated with job roles or users.

  Multiplying the rates by the hours spent on work generates revenue for your projects.

* After establishing your billing rates, you can then track revenue by creating billing records to record what has and has not been billed.

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >When you mark a Billing Record as Billed, it can never be edited. This is important when your rates vary and you want to lock the revenue and expense information on your project. Adding it to a billing record and marking it as Billed prevents it from being updated when the rates update in your system.

  For more information about creating billing records, see the article [Create billing records](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/create-billing-records.md).

* You can create billing rates for users, job roles, or you can have a one-time billing rate for a project or task.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The rates that calculate the revenue belong to the user who is logging the time or to their job roles.

* [User Billing Rates](#user-billing-rates) 
* [Job Role Billing Rates](#job-role-billing-rates) 
* [Fixed Billing Rates for projects or tasks](#fixed-billing-rates-for-projects-or-tasks) 
* [Override Billing Rates](#override-billing-rates)

### User Billing Rates {#user-billing-rates}

As a user administrator, when you create a user, you can associate them with a Billing Rate by specifying a value for the Billing Per Hour field in their profile.   
For more information about creating users, see the article [Add users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md)

![](assets/qs-user-edit-ui-with-rp-and-billing-per-hour-field-1-350x152.png)

### Job Role Billing Rates {#job-role-billing-rates}

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, when you create a job role, you can associate it with a Billing Rate by specifying a value for the Billing/ Hour field.

You can define the value of a job role billing rate using the Base Currency of your Workfront system or using another custom currency.

For more information about creating job roles and overriding their currency, see the article [Create and manage job roles](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/create-manage-job-roles.md)

![](assets/billing-rate-for-role-1-350x294.png)

### Fixed Billing Rates for projects or tasks {#fixed-billing-rates-for-projects-or-tasks}

In addition to user and job role hourly rates, you can also have the following fixed billing rates:

* Fixed Amount for Fixed Hourly Revenue Type 
* Fixed Amount for Fixed Revenue Revenue Type

For more information about how the fixed billing rates are used to calculate revenue, see [Overview of task Revenue Types](#overview-of-task-revenue-types).

### Override Billing Rates {#override-billing-rates}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You can override billing rates associated with job roles. You cannot override user billing rates or fixed rates.

You can override job role billing rates for:

* A specific Company

  For more information about creating job role billing rates specific to a company, see [Create and edit companies](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/create-and-edit-companies.md). 

* A specific Project

  For more information about creating job role billing rates specific to a project, see the article [Overview of overriding Job Role Billing Rates and calculating Revenue on a project](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/override-role-billing-rates-and-calculate-project-revenue.md).

## Track Revenue amounts

Workfront can track Planned Revenue automatically when tasks are created based on the Planned Hours of the tasks.

It can also track Actual Revenue automatically when Actual Hours are logged on the tasks, issues, and on the project.

There following table shows the types of revenue associated with tasks, issues, and projects. 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Planned Revenue</td> 
   <td> <p>For tasks, this is the revenue associated with the Planned Hours of tasks. The Planned Hours from all tasks roll up to the Planned Hours of the project to contribute to the calculation of the project Planned Hours. </p> <p>For more information about Planned Hours in Workfront, see <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/planned-hours.md" class="MCXref xref">Planned Hours overview</a>. </p> <p>Workfront calculates Planned Revenue for tasks and projects using the following formulas:</p> <p><code>Task Planned Revenue = Planned Hours * Billing hourly rate</code> </p> <p><code>Project Planned Revenue = SUM (All tasks Planned Revenue) +&nbsp;Fixed Revenue</code> </p> <!--
     <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(the note below is duplicated in this article: /Content/Resource Mgmt/Resource utilization/view-utilization-information.htm and in the glossary)</p>
    --> <p>Note:  <p>The project Planned Revenue that displays in the Project&nbsp;Details area and in project reports differs from the Planned Revenue that displays in the Utilization&nbsp;report. </p> <p>The Planned Revenue in the Project Details area reflects the task revenue associated with the task Planned Hours as well as the Fixed&nbsp;Revenue of the project. The Planned Revenue in the Utilization&nbsp;Report displays Planned Revenue associated only with the Planned Hours from the task assignments on the project. </p> 
     <div class="example" data-mc-autonum="<b>Example: </b>"> 
      <p>If the project has 1 task with 10 hours, assigned to a Consultant with $20 hourly rate, and the project has $100 Fixed Revenue, the Utilization report displays $200 for Planned Revenue (the Planned Revenue associated with the hours on the task). The Project&nbsp;Details section displays $300 (the Planned Revenue from the task and the Fixed Revenue for the project.) </p> 
     </div> </p> <p>Task Planned Revenue is calculated using the Billing hourly rate of the users or job roles assigned to the tasks. The Revenue Type of the tasks influences which rate (user or role) is used for calculating Planned Revenue.&nbsp;For more information, see the following sections in this article:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p><a href="#overview-of-task-revenue-types" class="MCXref xref">Overview of task Revenue Types</a> </p> </li>

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Actual Revenue*</td> 
   <td> <p>Associated with the Actual Hours of tasks, issues, and projects. </p> <p>Generally, Workfront calculates Actual Revenue using this formula:</p> <p><code>Planned Revenue = Planned Hours * Billing rate</code> </p> <p>For information on Actual Revenue calculations in the Utilization Report, see <a href="../../../resource-mgmt/resource-utilization/view-utilization-information.md" class="MCXref xref">View resource utilization information </a>. </p> <p>Tip: You cannot view Actual Revenue at the issue level, but the revenue associated with the Actual Hours on the issues contribute to the Actual Revenue of the project. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42; For Actual Hours, the user's rates always refer to the user who logs the hours or to the rates of their job roles. For information about when Workfront uses the rates of the user and when it uses the rates of their job roles, see the <!--[](#)--> section in this article.

For example, if a task with User Hourly Revenue Type is planned to take 2 hours and the user assigned to it has an hourly rate of $30 an hour, then the Planned Revenue of the task is $60. When the task is completed, if the user logs just 1.5 hours as the actual time spent to finish the task, the Actual Revenue amount is $45. If another user who is not assigned to the task logs the time, the Actual Revenue is calculated based on that user's Billing Rates.

You can record revenue in the following ways:

* By defining the Revenue Type of your tasks, and associating users or roles assigned to work items with billing rates. This calculates the revenue by the amount of Planned or Actual Hours on the work items. You can set a cap to the maximum amount charged for hourly rates, or not.  
  For more information about specifying the Revenue Type of a task, see the article [Edit tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks.md).

* By billing a flat Fixed Revenue rate for tasks or projects.  
  If you have tasks with Fixed Revenue, the Fixed Revenue amount will be added as the Planned Revenue of a task or a project, and the Planned Revenue of a task will be available to be added to a Billing Record as Fixed Revenue. 
* By setting a flat billing Fixed Revenue rate for a project, and then set hourly rates for the tasks within the project. Workfront adds the hourly rates for the tasks to the flat rate of the project.   
  For example, a mechanic using Workfront could enter a cost for parts as fixed revenue for the project, then bill hourly for the time spent fixing a car. Fixed Revenue on projects or tasks is then realized on completion.

You can also mark your tasks as "Not Billable", in which case there is no Planned or Actual Revenue associated with them.

## Overview of task Revenue Types {#overview-of-task-revenue-types}

By default, the Revenue Type of all new tasks is set according to the Task & Issue Preferences specified by your Workfront or group administrator.  
For more information about defining the task and issue preferences for your Workfront instance, see the article [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).

The Project Owner can modify the Revenue Type of tasks and the Fixed Revenue for projects.   
For more information about specifying the Fixed Revenue of a project, see the article [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).  
For more information about specifying the Revenue Type of a task, see the article [Edit tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks.md).

You can apply the following Revenue Types to your tasks or projects:

## Overview of Revenue for parent tasks

If you change a standalone task with billing information on it into a parent, the new parent task still retains any billing information previously applied to it, along with the hours previously applied. Any billing information coming from hours logged to the children tasks will roll up as Actual Revenue to the new parent task.

The Planned Revenue from the children tasks also rolls up to the parent task.

## Overview of Revenue for issues

Issues do not have Planned or Actual Revenue amounts, but they can have Actual Cost.

If you log hours for an issue and you use an hour type which is marked as "Count As Revenue", then Workfront calculates an Actual Cost amount according to the rate of the user who is logging in the time. This number is added to the Actual Cost of the project. The hours can also be included in a billing record.

For more information about tracking costs, see the article [Track costs](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/track-costs.md).

For more information about hour types, see the article [Manage hour types](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/hour-types.md).

## Revenue calculations

### Revenue calculations for tasks based on User and Role assignments {#revenue-calculations-for-tasks-based-on-user-and-role-assignments}

When calculating revenue for a task, consider the following:

* If a user or a job role shows a rate of $0.00, Workfront reads that as a valid amount and it will multiply this amount by the number of hours on the task to calculate the revenue. If you want to show no revenue for your tasks, ensure that the field for the billing rate for your user or job role is empty.
* When job role billing rates apply, Workfront uses the override rate at the project level, instead of the billing rate for that role defined at the system level every time there is an override rate on the project. 
* In case of multiple assignees on the tasks, the scenarios outlined below apply for each assignee.

There is a hierarchy of which rate is used in revenue calculations based on task assignments.

If your Workfront administrator enabled the **Assign Job Roles to hour entries manually** setting in the Timesheets & Hours Preferences area, and the user logging time on the project selects a different role to associate with this time, the Actual Revenue of the task or project always calculates based on the role associated with the hour entry. For information about enabling logging time for a specific job role, see the article [Timesheet and Hour Preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).

The following scenarios exist when calculating task revenue based on the Revenue Type and the nature of the task assignment:

* **The Revenue Type of the task is User Hourly**

### Revenue calculations for projects

You can track the following revenue types for projects:

* Planned Revenue for a project is calculated by the following formula:

  ```
  Project Planned Revenue = SUM(Task Planned Revenue)+ Fixed Revenue
  ```

  For information about how task Planned Revenue is calculated, see the [Revenue calculations for tasks based on User and Role assignments](#revenue-calculations-for-tasks-based-on-user-and-role-assignments) section in this article.

* Actual Revenue for a project is calculated by the following formula:

  ```
  Project Actual Revenue = SUM (Task Actual Revenue) + (Hours logged for the project x User Billing per Hour Rate) + SUM (Hours logged for the issues x User Billing per Hour rate)
  ```

For information about how task Actual Revenue is calculated, see the [Revenue calculations for tasks based on User and Role assignments](#revenue-calculations-for-tasks-based-on-user-and-role-assignments) section in this article.

For the Actual Revenue associated with the hours logged directly to the project or the issues, Workfront uses the Billing Rate of the user who logs the time on the project. If the user has no Billing Rate associated with their profile, Workfront uses the Billing Rate of their Primary Job Role. If both rates are zero, the Actual Revenue associated with the hours logged on the project or the issues is zero.
