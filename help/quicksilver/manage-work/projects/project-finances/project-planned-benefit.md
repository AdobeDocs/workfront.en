# Overview of project Planned Benefit

The Planned Benefit is the estimated amount of money that an organization might benefit from if a project is completed.

The Planned Benefit is not calculated by Adobe Workfront. As the Project Owner, you manually specify the Planned Benefit of a project in the Business Case. We recommend that each organization establish a policy as to how this value is determined.

The Planned Benefit of a project affects the Net Value of a project.  
For more information about calculating the Net Value of a project, see the article [Calculate Net Value](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/calculate-net-value.md).
