# Project finances included in project baselines

Baselines are snapshots of what the performance of a project looked like at a given moment in time. They store key pieces of information about the project, like key dates, progress, cost and revenue values.

When you create a baseline, the task information is also captured on the baseline tasks of that baseline.

For information about creating project baselines, see [Create project baselines](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-baselines.md).

## Financial information included in Baselines

You can create Baseline or Baseline Task reports to view information captured about the project or the tasks at a given time.

In addition to name and date information, baselines and baseline tasks include financial information about the project or tasks. The lists below display the financial information of the project and of the tasks that is accessible from the Baseline or the Baseline Task objects.

For information about what each field displays, see [Glossary of Adobe Workfront terminology](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/workfront-terminology-glossary.md).
