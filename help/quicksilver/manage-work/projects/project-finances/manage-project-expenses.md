# Manage project expenses

The process for creating and managing expenses is the same for both project and task-related expenses. Any expenses that are added to the project in the Business Case are added to the Expenses tab as planned expenses. For more information on the Business Case, see the article [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

The total amount of your expenses from all the tasks and the project contributes to the total cost of the project. The Planned Amount of the expenses contributes to the Planned Cost of the project, and the Actual Amount of the expenses contributes to the Actual Cost of the project.

## Add Expenses

1. Go to the project where you want to enter expenses.  
   If you want to add expenses to a task, navigate to a task instead.
1. Click **Expenses** in the left panel.

   The **Add an Expense** dialog box is displayed.
1. Update the following:

   * **Description:** Description of the expense.

   * **Task:** Begin typing the name of the task that this expense is associated with, then click it when it appears in the drop-down list.
   * **Planned Amount:** The planned budgeted amount for the expense.  
     This affects the Budgeted Cost of the project.
   
   * **Actual Amount:** The amount that the expense actual cost.  
     This affects the Actual Cost of the project.
   
   * **Planned Date:** The expected date for the expense to occur. You&nbsp;can type the&nbsp;date in the field using the *mm/dd/yy* format, or you can click&nbsp;the calendar icon&nbsp; ![Calendar icon](assets/calendar-icon.png)&nbsp;and select the date dynamically.
