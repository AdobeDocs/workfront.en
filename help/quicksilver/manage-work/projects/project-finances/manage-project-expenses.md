# Manage project expenses

The process for creating and managing expenses&nbsp;is the same for both project and task-related expenses. Any expenses that are added to the project in the Business Case are added to the Expenses tab as planned expenses. For more information on the Business Case, see the article [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

The total amount of your expenses from all the tasks and the project contributes to the total cost of the project. The Planned Amount of the expenses contributes to the Planned Cost of the project, and the Actual Amount of the expenses contributes to the Actual Cost of the project.

## Access requirements
