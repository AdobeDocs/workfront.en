# Request a project

<!--Audited: April 2024-->

You can request for a project to be approved before you start working on it. 

When you create a blank project, the status of the project is Idea. 

If you need a formal request for the project to be approved, we recommend building a Business Case for a new project so that you can outline some of the key points you want to achieve by completing it, as well as to present to your management your labor and expense budget. 

Filling out the Business Case and submitting the project for approval completes the formal request for the project. After submitting the business case for approval the status of the project becomes Requested. 

You can request a project when you add a new project in the following areas of Adobe Workfront:

* In the Projects area 
* In the Projects area of a Portfolio
* In the Projects area of a Program
* In the Groups area for the group of the project, when you are a group administrator.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>New: Standard </p>
   Or
   <p>Current: Plan </p>
   </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Projects</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>When you create a project request you automatically receive Manage permissions to the project </p> <p> For information about project permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-project.md" class="MCXref xref">Share a project in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator. For more information, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md). 

## Request a project

1. Do one of the following:

   * Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, or the **Main Menu** ![](assets/lines-main-menu.png) in the upper-left corner, if available, click **Projects**, then expand **New Project**.

   * Go to a program, then expand **New Project**. 
   * If you are a group administrator, you can also create a project in the Projects section of a group you manage. For more information, see [Create and modify a group's projects](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-projects.md).

1. Do one of the following:

   * Follow the same steps as for creating a project while defining a Business Case. (recommended)

     For information about defining a Business Case and requesting a project, see [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

   * Create a project from scratch or using a template and change the status to **Requested**.

     For information about creating a project, see [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md) or [Create a project using a template](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project-from-template.md).

   The project you request has a status of **Requested** and it displays on the **Requested Projects** tab of a Portfolio, if you associated it with a Portfolio. A portfolio manager can now review it and either approve it or reject it, in which case the status of the project changes to either **Approved** or **Rejected**.
