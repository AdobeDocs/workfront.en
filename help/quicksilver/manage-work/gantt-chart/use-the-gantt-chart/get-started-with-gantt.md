# Get started with the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]

<!-- Audited: 08/2025 -->

The Gantt charts in Adobe Workfront provide a visual representation of the timeline of a list of tasks or projects.

In [!DNL Adobe Workfront], there are two [!UICONTROL Gantt Charts] with similar functionality:

* **The task list [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]**: displays information about tasks and their timeline at the project level. A similar [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart] displays information about template tasks at the template level.
* **The project list [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]**: displays information about projects and their timeline. 

Although they look and feel similar, the functionality of each one is different.
