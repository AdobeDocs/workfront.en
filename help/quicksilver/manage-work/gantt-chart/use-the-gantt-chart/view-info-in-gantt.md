## Locate the  [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]

You can locate both the task list Gantt chart and project list [!UICONTROL Gantt chart] from multiple areas within Workfront. For more information, see [Get started with the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]](../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/get-started-with-gantt.md).

## View tasks on the [!UICONTROL Critical Path]

In the Project List [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart], tasks that are not on the [!UICONTROL Critical Path] display as light blue horizontal lines. Tasks that are on the [!UICONTROL Critical Path] of a project display as red horizontal lines.

For more information about tasks on the [!UICONTROL Critical Path], see [Overview of the project [!UICONTROL Critical Path]](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/critical-path.md).

## View task information in the project list [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]

You can view the task information for a project directly from the Project List. Tasks are listed under the name of each project.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot edit tasks from the Project List [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]. 

You can view the task information for a project directly from a list of projects in the following areas:

* In the [!UICONTROL Projects] area
* Within a Portfolio
* Within a Program

To view tasks in a project from a list of projects:

1. Go to one of the areas mentioned above.

   For example, from the [!UICONTROL Main Menu], click **[!UICONTROL Projects]**.

   A list of projects displays.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Gantt chart]** icon ![](assets/gantt-icon-nwe.png) in the upper-right corner of the screen.

## Use filters, views, and groupings

The [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart] is a visual representation of the information that is currently displayed in the task list. You can apply filters, views, and groupings to the objects listed in both [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]s. 

>[!CAUTION]
>
>You cannot apply filters, views, and groupings when you select [!UICONTROL Manual] save [!UICONTROL Timeline Planning] to save changes to your task list. For information about saving changes to tasks in a list, see [Edit tasks in a list](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks-in-a-list.md).

Filters and groupings that you apply to the list are reflected on both the Project List and Task List  [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]s and are also included when the Gantt charts are exported:

* Filters\
   You can apply a Filter to the list in order to control the information that is displayed in the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart].\
   For information about applying a Filter, see  [Filters overview in [!UICONTROL Adobe Workfront]](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/filters-overview.md).

* Groupings\
   Groupings that you apply to the list are reflected on the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart].\
   For information about applying a Grouping, see  [Groupings overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/groupings-overview.md).

Views are not reflected on the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]. However, when you export the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart] (as described in  [Export the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart] to PDF](../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/export-gantt-chart-to-pdf.md)), the task list is exported in addition to the [!UICONTROL Gantt chart], with the current View applied to the list.

## Configure Display Options

You can choose what type of information displays in both [!UICONTROL Gantt charts]. For more information, see [Configure how information displays on the [!UICONTROL Gantt Chart]](../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/configure-info-on-gantt-chart.md).
