When you plan to be out of the office for a short period of time, you can temporarily delegate your work to other users to ensure that your absence does not become a roadblock to work being completed.

For example, if certain tasks are due before you return but you do not have the time to complete them before you leave, you can delegate your tasks to another user so they can complete them on time and not delay the completion of the project until after you return.

You can delegate the following objects in Adobe Workfront:

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> <p>Projects where you are designated as the Project Owner (not yet, not for the MVP)</p> </li>
  -->

* Tasks assigned to you
* Issues assigned to you

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> <p>Proof approvals assigned to you (NOTE:&nbsp;is this true?? does the new functionality include proof approvals??)</p> </li>
  -->

* Project, task, issue, document approvals assigned to you.

This article contains general information about delegating tasks and issues.

For information about delegating project, task, issue, and document approvals, see [Delegate approval request](../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/delegate-approval-requests.md).

For information about how to delegate tasks and issues see [Delegate tasks and issues](../../manage-work/delegate-work/how-to-delegate-work.md).

Consider the following when you delegate tasks and issues:

* You can only delegate tasks and issues that are assigned to one user. You cannot delegate work items assigned to more than one entity. 
* You can only delegate the tasks and issues assigned to you. You cannot delegate tasks and issues that are assigned to other users, teams, or job roles.
* Your Workfront administrator must enable the Delegation preferences in the Setup area before you can delegate your work to others.&nbsp;For information, see [Configure Delegation preferences](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-delegation-preferences.md).

  (NOTE: can the group admin do this too?)
  </MadCap:conditionalText>
  -->

* The same user can be selected as the delegate by multiple users.
