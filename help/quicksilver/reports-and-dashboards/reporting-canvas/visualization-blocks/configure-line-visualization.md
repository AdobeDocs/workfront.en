# Configure a line visualization in Reporting Canvas

A line visualization can help you quickly tell a story about your data by enhancing the narrative and highlighting important information using a series of data horizontal points with a continuous line.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>The contents of this article are available as part of a beta program that must be joined by a Workfront administrator. After joining, the Workfront administrator may then grant access to other users in their environment. For more information on participating in the beta and granting access to users, see <a href="../../../product-announcements/betas/reporting-canvas-beta.md" class="MCXref xref">Reporting Canvas beta</a>.</p> <!--

     <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p>
    --> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage access to the report</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td>

## Configure a line visualization

1. Begin adding a visualization to your report, as explained in [Add or edit a visualization block in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/visualization-blocks/add-or-edit-report-visualization.md), choosing **Line** as the visualization type.

1. Click the Edit visualization icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of the visualization, then do any of the following.

   1. On the **Settings** tab:

       <col>
       <tbody>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Visualization type</td>
         <td>Switch to a different type of visualization. If you do this, the subsequent options on the menu might change.<!--
           <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">The same data is entered automatically for the Horizontal axis so that _____. (use snippet)</p>
          --></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Vertical axis</td>
         <td>Select the data that you want to depict along the vertical left edge, or Y axis.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">Horizontal axis</td>
         <td>Select the data that you want to depict along the horizontal bottom edge, or X axis, as well as how you want it summarized.</td>
        </tr>
       </tbody>
      </table>

      <!--   
      <li value="2" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"><p>On the <b>Data</b> tab:</p>   
      <table style="table-layout:auto">   
      <col>   
      <col>   
      <tbody>   
      <tr>   
      <td role="rowheader">Data source (drop-down menu)</td>   
      <td>Change the data source for the visualization to another table on the report canvas.</td>   
      </tr>   
      <tr>   
      <td role="rowheader">Show Data Source</td>   
      <td>Enable this option to show the source table for the visualization on the report canvas, or disable the option to hide it.</td>   
      </tr>   
      </tbody>   
      </table></li>
