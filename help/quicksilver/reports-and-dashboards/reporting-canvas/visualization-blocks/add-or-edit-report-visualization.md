# Add or edit a visualization block in Reporting Canvas

A visualization can help you tell a story with your data by highlighting important information in an easy-to-understand way.

You can add the following types of visualizations to a report:

* Bar
* Column
* Pie
* KPI

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must enroll in the Reporting Canvas beta. For more information, see [Reporting Canvas beta: overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/reporting-canvas-beta-overview.md).

## Add or edit a visualization block

>[!TIP]
>
>All of your changes are saved automatically as you build and edit the blocks in your report.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Reporting**.
1. Click **New report**, then create a report with tables that contain data, as described in [Build a report in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/manage-reports/build-report.md) and [Add or edit a table block in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/table-blocks/add-or-edit-report-table.md).

   Or

   In an existing report with tables containing data, click the **More Menu** icon ![](assets/more-icon.png) in the report header, then select **Edit**.

1. On the right side of the screen, under **Add a Block**, either:

   Drag the **Visualization** icon **** onto the canvas directly to your desired location.

   Or

   Double-click the **Visualization** icon **** to add a visualization to the top of the canvas.

   Or

   Select the **Visualize** icon **** at the top of an existing table on the canvas.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can change the size of the block once you place it by dragging its corner handles.

1. (Conditional) If the report contains more than one table, in the **Build your visualization** box that displays, select the source table for the visualization.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you select **+ Add New Table**, a new table block is created beneath the visualization block. You must populate the table with data before you can add a visualization for it. For more information on creating and editing tables, see [ [Add or edit a table block in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/table-blocks/add-or-edit-report-table.md)](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/table-blocks/add-or-edit-report-table.md)

1. Select the type of visualization you want to add.

   ![](assets/select-vis-type-350x205.png)

   Your visualization displays, representing the data of the table you selected.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The colors of the dots next to the visualization title and the source table title match. In a report with multiple tables, this helps you easily match visualizations with their associated tables.

1. Continue on to configure your visualization:

   * **Bar** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a bar visualization in the Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/visualization-blocks/configure-bar-visualization.md#bar).
   * **Column** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a column visualization in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/visualization-blocks/configure-column-visualization.md).
   * **Pie** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure pie visualization in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/visualization-blocks/configure-pie-visualization.md).
   * **KPI** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a KPI visualization in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/visualization-blocks/configure-kpi-visualization.md).
