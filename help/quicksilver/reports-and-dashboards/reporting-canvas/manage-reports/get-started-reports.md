# Get started with Reporting Canvas

With the Reporting Canvas, you can create highly customizable reports. The easy-to-use report builder displays a dynamic preview of your data and auto-saves as you make changes. And the responsive report layouts provide a better viewing experience on different devices.

New functionality also allows you more control over what displays when you view a report. For example, you can display it based on specific teams, date ranges, and other criteria.

## Building a report

The customization and flexibility of the Reporting Canvas let you elevate your reports to the next level and become a data storyteller. Starting with a blank story canvas, you can add blocks of data to your report to convey the information that is important to you. You can then focus the narrative using filters and enhance it using visualizations, text, and embedded external sources.
