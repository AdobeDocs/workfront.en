# List your reports in Reporting Canvas

You can view a list of all reports created by you, all public reports, or all reports. In the list, the row for each report includes the following information:

* The last user who updated the report and when the update occurred.
* The number of the report's views.
* A line visualization showing how the reports' views have trended over time.

  For example, the line might show a recent decline in views, indicating that you need to improve the report's usefulness or archive it.

  <!--
  <p style="color: #ff1493;" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">[Show one here]</p>
  -->

When you list your reports, you can also search for reports and use tags 

<!--
<span style="color: #ff1493;" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">[show using 16-pixel-high icon screenshot inline]</span>
-->

to categorize and organize them.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:
