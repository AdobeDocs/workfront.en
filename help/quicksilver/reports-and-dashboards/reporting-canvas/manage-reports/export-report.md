# Export a report in Reporting Canvas

You can export an entire report—or a specific block—into a file format to fit your needs. You can export to:

* PDF (currently disabled)
* CSV
* PNG
* XLSX

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must enroll in the Reporting Canvas beta. For more information, see [Reporting Canvas beta: overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/reporting-canvas-beta-overview.md).

## Export a report

1. Navigate to the report that you want to export.
1. In the report header, click the **More** icon ![](assets/more-icon-27x15.png), click **Export**, then select the file format you want to create.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Consider the following regarding your exported files:
   >
   >   * If you export a report that contains multiple tables to an XLSX format, the exported file contains a separate sheet for each table.
   >   * If you export a report that contains multiple tables to a CSV format, the exported result is a zipped folder that contains a separate file for each table.
   >   * If you export a table that contains grouped rows to a CSV format, the CSV file includes all of the rows, but they are not displayed in groups.
   >   

<!-- 1. (Conditional) If you selected **PDF**, configure the fields below to format the exported file, then click **Download PDF**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The PDF preview in the right pane updates as you configure each field.
