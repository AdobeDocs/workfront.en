# Remove an External Page from a dashboard

<!-- Audited: 1/2025 -->

You can remove an External Page from a dashboard if it's no longer needed.

However, you cannot delete an external page after it is created in Adobe Workfront. You can delete an external page only using the API. For information about the Workfront API, see [API basics](../../../wf-api/general/api-basics.md). For information about creating external pages, see [Embed an external web page in a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/embed-external-web-page-dashboard.md).
