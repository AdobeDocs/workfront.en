## Prerequisites

The dashboard must be created before you can print it.

For information on creating dashboards, see [Create a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/create-dashboard.md).

## Understand what information is printed when printing a dashboard

When printing a dashboard or saving it as a .PDF file, some information from the dashboard, as it appears in the Adobe Workfront web application, may not appear on the printed or exported file.

* All objects on the dashboard, including list views, external web pages, reports, and calendars
* Your company's logo, if your Workfront administrator has customized it in your Global Navigation Bar. For more information about branding the Workfront site, see [Brand your Adobe Workfront instance](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/brand-workfront/brand-your-workfront-instance.md).

### What is not displayed? {#what-is-not-displayed}
