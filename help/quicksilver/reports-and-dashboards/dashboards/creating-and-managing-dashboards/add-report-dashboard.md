# Add a report to a dashboard

<!-- Audited: 1/2025 -->

You can add a report to a new or existing dashboard directly from a report. You can also add an existing report to a dashboard, as described in [Create a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/create-dashboard.md). Note that there is a maximum of 25 reports, calendars, or external pages that can be added to a single dashboard.

>[!NOTE]
>
>External lookup fields from custom forms are currently not supported in dashboards. You cannot edit the field value inline, and it may not display properly in a dashboard.
