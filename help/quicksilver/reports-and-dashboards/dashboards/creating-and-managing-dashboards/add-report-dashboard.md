# Add a report to a dashboard

You can add a report to a new or existing dashboard directly from a report. You can also add an existing report to a dashboard, as described in [Create a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/create-dashboard.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Reports, Dashboards, and Calendars</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Object permissions</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to the dashboard</p> <p>View permissions to the report</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must create a report before you can add it to a dashboard.

For information on creating a report, see [Create a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-report.md).

## Add a report to an existing dashboard

1. Go to a report that you have permissions to Manage and you want to add to a dashboard.
1. Click the **Report Actions** drop-down menu.
1. Click **Add to Dashboard**. A maximum of 10 recently modified dashboards—owned by the logged-in user—appear in order of newest to oldest.
1. Select the dashboard that you want to add your report to.  
  
   After you select the dashboard, you can add the report as if you are editing that dashboard.

## Add a report to a new dashboard

1. Go to a report that you have permissions to Manage and you want to add to a dashboard.
1. Click the **Report Actions** drop-down.
1. Click **Add to Dashboard**, then click **New Dashboard** to add your report.  
   A dashboard builder displays.
