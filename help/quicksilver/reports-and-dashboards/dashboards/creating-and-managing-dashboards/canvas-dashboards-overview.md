# Canvas Dashboards Overview

Canvas Dashboards, a feature currently in development for Dashboards, offers a new option for building effective dashboards in Workfront. Canvas Dashboards will allow Reporting Canvas visualizations to be easily included with existing reports, providing increased flexibility as well as new layout options.

This feature is in development, and does not yet support:
* external pages
* calendar integration
* prompted reports
* distribution through layout templates

For a complete list of features that have been added to Canvas Dashboards, see [Canvas Dashboards: release activity](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/canvas-dashboards-release-activity.md)
