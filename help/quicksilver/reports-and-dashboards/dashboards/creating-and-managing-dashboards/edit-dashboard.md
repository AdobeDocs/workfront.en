# Edit a dashboard

<!-- Audited: 1/2025 -->

The purpose of the dashboard is to provide quick access to information. You can populate a dashboard with the following items in Adobe Workfront:

* Reports

  For more information about creating reports, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

* External pages

  For more information about creating external pages, see [Embed an external web page in a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/embed-external-web-page-dashboard.md).

After you create these items and you add them to a dashboard, you can edit the dashboard to add more items to it, remove existing items from it, or edit the dashboard information.

Any changes made to a dashboard will impact all users who have access to that dashboard.

When you share a dashboard with users, all the reports and external pages are also shared with the same users.

   >When searching for an item, the search returns any of the 2,000 most recently created reports. Report names that include unicode characters are not returned in search results. As a best practice, avoid including unicode characters when naming objects in Workfront by typing names rather than copying and pasting names from another source.
