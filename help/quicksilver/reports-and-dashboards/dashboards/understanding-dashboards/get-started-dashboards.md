# Get started with dashboards

<!-- Audited: 1/2024 -->

The purpose of a dashboard is to provide quick access to information that comes from multiple reports. First, you can gather information in reports and you can then place multiple reports on dashboards to make the information easier to access.

## Objects that you can add to a dashboard

You can populate a dashboard with the following items in Adobe Workfront:

* Reports  
  For more information about creating reports, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

* Calendars  
  For more information about creating calendars, see [Calendar reports overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/calendar-reports-overview.md).

* External Pages  
  For more information about creating external pages, see [Embed an external web page in a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/embed-external-web-page-dashboard.md).

For more information about creating a dashboard, see [Create a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/create-dashboard.md).

## Share dashboards

You can share a dashboard with users in the following ways:

* Sharing on an individual basis.  
  For more information about sharing dashboards, see [Share reports, dashboards, and calendars](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/permissions-reports-dashboards-calendars.md) and [Share a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/share-dashboard.md).

* Add a dashboard to any area or object in Workfront with a custom section.  
  For more information on creating custom sections, see [Left navigation in the Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/simplified-left-navigation.md).

* Place the dashboards on layout templates, which you can share with users.  
  For more information about sharing dashboards through layout templates, see [Customize the left panel using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-left-panel.md).

* Print a hard copy of them to share with users.  
  For more information about printing dashboards, see [Print a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/print-dashboard.md).

* Export them as a PDF file so you can email them to users.  
  For more information about exporting a dashboard to a PDF file, see [Export a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/export-dashboard.md).

When you share a dashboard with users, all the reports, calendars, and external pages that are on the dashboard are also shared with the same users by default.

>If a user is deleted, any dashboards they have created are no longer accessible. To learn more, see [Delete users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/delete-a-user.md).

## Display dashboards

You can display a dashboard in the following ways:

* Access the custom section where the dashboard is placed.  
  For more information on placing dashboards on custom sections, see [Left navigation in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/simplified-left-navigation.md).
