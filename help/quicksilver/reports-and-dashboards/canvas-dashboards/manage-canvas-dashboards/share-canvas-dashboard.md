## Share a Canvas Dashboard

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, or (if available), click the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]** icon ![Main Menu](/help/_includes/assets/main-menu-icon-left-nav.png) in the upper-left corner, then click **Dashboards**.

1. In the left panel, click **Canvas Dashboards**, then click the name of the Canvas Dashboard that you would like to share.

1. Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner of the page.

1. In the **Give access to:** field of the **Dashboard Sharing** window that appears, begin typing the names of specific users, teams, roles, groups, or companies in your Workfront instance with whom you would like to share the Canvas Dashboard. When the name you are looking for appears in the auto-complete list below the field, click it to add it to the list of intended recipients.

1. (Optional) After you have added an entity to the list of intended recipients, you can edit the kind of access they will receive for this Canvas Dashboard. By default they will receive only **View** access, but you can give them Manage access by clicking **View >** next to the entity, then selecting **Manage** in the dropdown list. Note that some entities cannot have their access level changed, such as administrators.

1. Once you have added everyone with whom you would like to share the Canvas Dashboard, click the **Share** button.
