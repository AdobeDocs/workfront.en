## Considerations about sharing dashboards

* By default, the creator of a dashboard has Manage permissions to it. 

* You can share dashboards that you create with other individuals, teams, groups, job roles, or companies. You can also share dashboards others created and previously shared with you. 

* By default, when you share a dashboard, users inherit View permissions to all the reports objects on the dashboard unless the permission is updated before sharing. 

* If you have View permissions on a dashboard, you can still share the dashboard but you can't assign a permission higher than View to the recipients.


## Share a Canvas Dashboard


{{step1-to-dashboards}}

1. In the left panel, click **Canvas Dashboards**. 

1. On the **Canvas Dashboards** page, select the dashboard you want to share. 

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the **Share** button. The **Dashboard Sharing** dialog box appears.

1. In the **Give access to** field, begin typing the name of a specific user, team, role, group, or company you want to share the Canvas Dashboard with, then select it when it appears in the drop-down list. 

1. (Optional) To edit a user's access to the dashboard, click **View** next to their name, then select **Manage** in the drop-down list that appears. 

    >[!NOTE]

    >Some users can't have their access level changed (e.g. administrators).

1. Repeat steps 5-6 for each user you want to share the dashboard with.

1. Click the **Share** button. The recipients receive an email notification informing them that the dashboard has been shared with them, which they can now access at **Dashboards** > **Canvas Dashboards** > **Shared Dashboards**.

    >Individual user preferences and system exclusions for email notifications may apply.
