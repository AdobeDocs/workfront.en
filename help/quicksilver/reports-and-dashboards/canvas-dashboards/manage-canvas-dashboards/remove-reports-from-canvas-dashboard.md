# Remove reports from a dashboard

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Canvas Dashboards feature is currently only available for users participating in the beta stage. For more information, see [Canvas Dashboards beta information](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/canvas-dashboards-beta-information.md).

Once a dashboard is created and you've added reports to it, you can remove older reports that are no longer applicable for that specific dashboard. 

Removing a report from a dashboard is permanent. If you need to re-add a report after it's been deleted, you will need to recreate the report.
