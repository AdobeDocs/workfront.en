# Arrange reports in a dashboard

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Canvas Dashboards feature is currently only available for users participating in the beta stage. For more information, see [Canvas Dashboards beta information](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/canvas-dashboards-beta-information.md).

Once a report is added to a dashboard, they display as a report widget in the dashboard so you can quickly visualize its data at a glance. Once multiple reports have been added, it's recommended to rearrange the size and order of each widget to display the dashboard data more efficiently.
