## Create a dashboard

Canvas dashboards offers a wide variety of options and configurations that you can use when building a dashboard. In this section, we will walk you through the general process of creating a dashboard.  

{{step1-to-dashboards}}

1. In the left panel, click **Canvas Dashboards**. 

1. Click **New Dashboard** in the top-right corner.  

1. In the **Create dashboard** box, enter the dashboard's **Name** and **Description**.  

1. Click **Create**. The **Add report box** opens. From here, you can create a new report or add an existing report to the dashboard. 

## Add a report to a dashboard 

Once a dashboard is created, the next step is adding your reports to it. You can do this by either creating a report from scratch in the Canvas Dashboards section or adding an existing one.  

There are 3 types of reports you can create in Canvas Dashboards: 

* **KPI**: This report displays your key performance indicator data as a number. 
For more, see [Build a KPI report](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/canvas-dashboards/add-reports/build-kpi-report.md). 

* **Chart**: This report displays your data as a bar, column, line, or pie chart. 
For more, see [Build a chart report](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/canvas-dashboards/add-reports/build-chart-report.md).

* **Table**: This report displays your data in a table format. 
For more, see [Build a table report](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/canvas-dashboards/add-reports/build-table-report.md).

For more information on adding an existing report to a dashboard, see [Add an existing report to a dashboard](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/canvas-dashboards/add-reports/add-existing-report.md).
