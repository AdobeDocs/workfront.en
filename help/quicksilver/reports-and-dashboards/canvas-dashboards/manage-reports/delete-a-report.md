# Delete a report in a Canvas Dashboard

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Canvas Dashboards feature is currently only available for users participating in the beta stage. For more information, see [Canvas Dashboards beta information](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/canvas-dashboards-beta-information.md).

Once a Canvas Dashboard is created and you've added reports to it, you can delete older reports that are no longer applicable for that specific dashboard. 

Deleting a report is permanent. If you need to re-add a report after it's been deleted, you will need to recreate the report.
