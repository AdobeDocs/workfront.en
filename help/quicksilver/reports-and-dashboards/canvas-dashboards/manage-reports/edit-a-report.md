>The Canvas Dashboards feature is currently only available for users participating in the beta stage. For more information, see [Canvas Dashboards beta information](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/canvas-dashboards-beta-information.md).

After you add reports to a Canvas Dashboard, you can edit the report's information to change the data that displays in the dashboard.

Any changes made to a report will impact all users who have access to the dashboard that contains it.

    * **Filters**
    * **Drilldown Column Settings**

## Edit an existing report

When you edit an existing report, the report data you select will override the data that is currently displayed in the widget. If you want to add an additional existing report instead of replacing one, it's recommended to create a separate report widget.
