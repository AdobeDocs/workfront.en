# Add or edit a table block in Reporting Canvas

A table displays field information in columns that can be filtered, grouped, and sorted.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must enroll in the Reporting Canvas beta. For more information, see [Reporting Canvas beta: overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/canvas-dashboards-beta/reporting-canvas-beta-overview.md).

## Add or edit a table block

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![Main Menu icon](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Reporting**.
1. Click **New report**.

   Or

   Go to an existing report, click the **More** icon ![More icon](assets/more-icon-27x15.png) in the report header, then click **Edit**.

1. On the right side of the screen under **Add a block**, either:

   Drag the **Table** icon ![Table icon](assets/table-icon.png) onto the canvas directly to your desired location.

   Or

   Double-click the **Table** icon ![Table icon](assets/table-icon.png) to add a table to the top of the canvas.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can change the size of the block after it is placed by dragging its corner handles.

1. Click **Untitled table** in the table header, then type a title for the table.

1. Click **Edit** in the center of the table block to configure the table.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the table was already part of the canvas (such as when editing an existing report), the **Edit** button does not display in the center of the block. To edit the table, click the **Edit** icon ![Edit icon](assets/edit-icon.png) in the table header instead.

1. In the **Fields** panel on the right, locate a field that you want to add as a column to the table, then either drag it onto the table where you want it or double-click it to add it as the last column in the table.

   You can type text in the **Search** box to find a specific field by name. You can also use the two drop-down menus under this box to narrow the list of displayed fields to one or both of the following:

   * The object type associated with the field you want, such as Project or Task
   * The field type you want, such as Date or Currency

   Repeat this step for each field that you want to add as a column.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can change the order of columns in a table by dragging a selected column to a new position.

1. Do any of the following to configure the table further:
  
   * **Add a formula field**: Click **New +** at the top of the **Fields** list. For more instructions on creating a formula field, see [Build a formula field in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/table-blocks/create-formula-field.md).
   * **Add a filter**: Drag the field that you want the table to be filtered by onto the **Filter** section above the table. For more information on setting up filter rules, see [Filter a table in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/table-blocks/configure-filter-rules-for-table.md).
   * **Group rows by specific attributes**:&nbsp;Drag the field that you want the table to be grouped by onto the **Group** section above the table. For more information on creating row groups, see [Group table rows in Reporting Canvas](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reporting-canvas/table-blocks/group-rows-in-table.md).
