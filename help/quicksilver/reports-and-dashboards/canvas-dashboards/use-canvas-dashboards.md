Canvas Dashboards allow you to visualize your Adobe Workfront data by adding different report types onto a flexible canvas layout. This article provides an overview of how to use Canvas Dashboards effectively.

### Temporarily customize table reports

You can temporarily customize table reports on dashboards. These changes only apply to your current session and do not affect the original report configuration.

1. In the left panel, click **Canvas Dashboards**.
1. Click the name of an existing dashboard to open it.
    ![Open a dashboard](assets/open-dashboard.png)
1. Locate the table report that you want to customize.
1. Choose any of the following options to customize the report:

    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Add Column** | Click **Add Column** to add additional columns to the report. |
    | **Configure columns** | Choose to show or hide specific columns in the report. |
    | **Row height** | Adjust the row height for the report. |
    | **Snap scroll** | Enable or disable snap scrolling for easier navigation through the report. |

    >
    >These changes only apply to your current session and do not affect the original report configuration. To make permanent these changes, you need to edit the report.

<!--### Use drilldowns

You can use drilldowns in Canvas Dashboards to sort and group data within reports.

1. In the left panel, click **Canvas Dashboards**.
1. Click the name of an existing dashboard to open it.
    ![Open a dashboard](assets/open-dashboard.png)
1. Locate the report that you want to look at.

### Add additional columns to table reports


## View reports with grouped data

Report creators can configure reports to display grouped data. When viewing these reports on a Canvas Dashboard, you can expand or collapse the grouped data to see more or less detail.

Data within groups is sorted alphabetically or chronologically by default, depending on the data type. You can click the column headers to sort the data within each group based on different attributes. When you sort by a different attribute, the order of the groups remains unchanged.

When you sort by the same field that your report is grouped by, the group order can flip. For example, a text-based grouping that normally runs A–Z can switch to Z–A. This only happens when the sort column and the grouping attribute are the same.


## Saving and Sharing Dashboards

After customizing your Canvas Dashboard, you can save your changes. Additionally, you can share the dashboard with other users in your organization, provided you have the appropriate sharing permissions.

For more detailed instructions on creating, managing, and customizing Canvas Dashboards, refer to the related articles in the [Canvas Dashboards overview](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/canvas-dashboards/canvas-dashboards-overview.md) section.-->

## View reports with grouped data

Report creators can configure reports to display grouped data. When a report has a grouping, you can expand or collapse the grouped data to see more or less detail.

By default, data within each group is sorted alphabetically or chronologically, depending on the field type. You can click a column header to sort the data within each group. When you sort by a field that is different from the grouping field, the order of the groups does not change.

However, when you sort by the same field that the report is grouped by, the group order can change. For example, a text-based grouping that normally runs A–Z may switch to Z–A.
