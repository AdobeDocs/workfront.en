# Use Canvas Dashboards

Canvas Dashboards allow you to visualize your Adobe Workfront data by adding different report types onto a flexible canvas layout. This article provides an overview of how to use Canvas Dashboards effectively.

## Accessing Canvas Dashboards

To access Canvas Dashboards, navigate to the Dashboards section in Adobe Workfront. From there, you can view existing dashboards or create a new one if you have the necessary permissions.

## Navigating the Canvas

Once you open a Canvas Dashboard, you can interact with the reports displayed on the canvas. You can resize, drag, and drop reports to customize the layout according to your preferences.

## Interacting with Reports

You can interact with individual reports on the Canvas Dashboard. This includes filtering data, drilling down into specific metrics, and exporting report data for further analysis.

## Saving and Sharing Dashboards

After customizing your Canvas Dashboard, you can save your changes. Additionally, you can share the dashboard with other users in your organization, provided you have the appropriate sharing permissions.
