## Create a formula field for a report

1. Start creating or editing a report table, as described in [Add or edit a report table in Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/add-or-edit-report-table.md).
1. If you haven't done so yet, click **Edit** to configure the table.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the table was already added when you opened the report, the Edit button does not display. To edit the table, click the Edit icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png) in the table header.
