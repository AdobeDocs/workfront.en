# Add or edit a visualization in a report in Reporting Canvas

A visualization can help you quickly tell a story about your data by enhancing the narrative and highlighting important information.

You can add the following types of visualizations to a report:

* Bar
* Column

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> <p>Line</p> </li>
  -->

* Pie

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> <p>Bubble</p> </li>
  -->

* KPI

## Add or edit a visualization in a report

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Reports**.
1. Click **New report**.

   Or

   Go to an existing report, click the **More Menu** icon ![](assets/more-icon.png) in the report header, then select **Edit**.

1. (Conditional) In the report building that displays, if there isn't already a table on the canvas, add and configure one as explained in [Add or edit a report table in Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/add-or-edit-report-table.md).
1. From the right panel, double-click the **Visualization** icon ![](assets/visualization-icon.png) or drag it onto the canvas where you want it.

   If you double-click the icon, the visualization displays at the top of the canvas in its default size, which you can change by dragging its corner handles.

1. Select the table (listed on the visualization block) that you want the visualization to depict.

   ![](assets/select-table-on-vis-350x155.png)

1. Select the type of visualization you want to add.

   ![](assets/select-vis-type-350x205.png)

   Your visualization displays, representing the data in the table you selected.

   The dot next to the title of the visualization is the same color as the dot next to the title of the table. In a report with multiple tables, this helps you easily match visualizations to their associated tables.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If you created the table after you added the visualization, the bar chart is selected by default. To change the type, click the **Settings** icon.

1. Continue on to configure your visualization:

   * **Bar** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a bar visualization in the Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/configure-bar-visualization.md#bar).
   * **Column** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a column visualization in Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/configure-column-visualization.md).
   * **Line** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a line visualization in Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/configure-line-visualization.md).
   * **Pie** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure pie visualization in Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/configure-pie-visualization.md).
   * **Bubble** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a bubble visualization in the Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/configure-bubble-visualization.md) .
   * **KPI** visualization: For instructions, see [Configure a KPI visualization in Reporting Canvas](../../reports-and-dashboards/new-reporting-experience/configure-kpi-visualization.md).
