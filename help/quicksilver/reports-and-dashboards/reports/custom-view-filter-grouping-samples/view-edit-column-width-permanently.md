# View: permanently edit the width of a column

<!-- Audited: 11/2024 -->

You can temporarily modify to width of columns by dragging and dropping their margins to match the desired width. For more information, see [Modify column width and order](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/modify-column-width-order.md).

To permanently change the width of any column of any view, you must use text mode in the column as you edit the view.

## Permanently edit the width of a column

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you manually modify the width of a column as described in the section [Modify width and order of columns temporarily](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/modify-column-width-order.md#modify-width-and-order-of-columns-temporarily) in the article [Modify column width and order](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/modify-column-width-order.md) after you have permanently modified the width of the column, the width of the column is preserved according to your manual resizing. In this case, the width of the column updated according to the following steps is overwritten. You can view the column according to the width defined in the following steps after you clear your cache or log in from another browser.
