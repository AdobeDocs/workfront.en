# Grouping: edit the display name in a grouping

You can rename groupings to something more familiar to your users.

For example, when you apply the standard Portfolio Name grouping to a list of projects, the name of the grouping appears as *Portfolio: Name: `<name of portfolio>`*.

You can modify this grouping using text mode to display a name that is easier to read.

## Edit the display name in a grouping

To change the display name in a project grouping:

1. Go to a list of projects.
1. From the **Grouping**drop-down menu, select **New Grouping**.

1. Click&nbsp;**Add Grouping**, and start typing "Portfolio Name" in the **First by:** field, then select it when it displays in the list.

1. Click **Switch to Text Mode**.
1. Done one of following:

   * Add the following code to the existing text available in the **Group your Report** box:

     ```   
     group.0.displayname=Your
     ```

     ```   
     Value
     ```

     Or, in this case:

     ```   
     group.0.displayname=Portfolio
     ```

   * Remove all the lines in the text mode interface of the grouping that have the word "name" in them, then add the line:

     ```   
     group.0.name=Your Value
     ```

     Or, in this case:

     ```   
     group.0.name=Portfolio
     ```

     You can also leave the    
   
     ```   
     group.0.name
     ```   
   
     line blank, in which case the grouping shows the name of the value you are grouping by.
