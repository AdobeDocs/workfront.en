# Grouping: organize list results by a calculated value common to all objects in the grouping

You might want to view your tasks grouped by Percent Complete in ranges of 0-25, 26-50, 51-75, 75-99, and 100. You can create a grouping using text mode to do this.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars</p> <p>Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to a report</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

1. Click `Switch to Text Mode`.
1. In the available space, add the following code:

   ```
   textmode=true<br>group.0.valueexpression=IF({percentComplete}>=0&&{percentComplete}<=25,'0-25%',IF({
   ```

   ```
   percentComplete
   ```

   ```
   }>25&&{percentComplete}<=50,'26-50%',IF({percentComplete}>50&&{percentComplete}<=75,'51-75%',IF({percentComplete}>75&&{percentComplete}<=100,'76-100%',''))))<br>group.0.linkedname=direct<br>group.0.valueformat=doubleAsString<br>group.0.namekey=percentComplete
   ```

1. Click `Done`, then `Save Grouping`.
