# Filter: eliminate items in a list by comparing two fields

You can filter items out of a list by comparing two of their fields. For example, you can display only tasks where the Actual Completion Date of the task is greater than the Planned Completion Date.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td>
