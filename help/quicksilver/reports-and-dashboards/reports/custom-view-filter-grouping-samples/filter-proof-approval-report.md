# Filter:&nbsp;Proof Approval report to omit previous proof versions

On a Proof Approval report, you can use the&nbsp;**Is Current Document Version** filter to include only the current versions of proofs waiting for your approval.

This is useful, for example, if you have been asked to approve proofs that have multiple versions. When you run the Proof Approval report with the Is Current Document Version filter, the report lists only the current version of each proof awaiting your approval, omitting earlier versions that you no longer need to work on.&nbsp;

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col>

 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td>
