# Group a report by a multi-select custom field

You can group by the value in a multi-select custom field in a Adobe Workfront report. Examples of multi-select custom fields are:

* Checkboxes
* Multi-select dropdown menus

You can group by this type of field only by using text mode. For information about using text mode, see the article [Text Mode overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot chart a report by a multi-select custom field. You need to create an additional calculated field that refers to the multi-select custom field to also chart the report by the value of the multi-select custom field. For more information, see [Chart a report by a multi-select custom field](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/chart-report-by-multi-select-custom-field.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td>

   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars</p> <p>Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to a report</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Group a report by multi-select custom fields

To be able to group by a multi-select custom field, you must have the following prerequisites:

* Build the multi-select custom field in a custom form.  
  For information about building custom forms and adding custom fields to them, see the article [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

* Attach the custom form to objects.
* Populate the multi-select custom field with a value on each object.&nbsp;

To group by a multi-select custom field in a report:

1. Create a report or edit an existing one where you want to add a grouping for a multi-select custom field.  
   For information about creating reports, see the article [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

1. Select the **Groupings** tab.
1. Click **Switch to Text Mode**.

1. Select the text in the **Group your Report** box and replace it with the following code:  
   <pre>group.0.displayname=Multi-select Custom Field Name<br>group.0.valueexpression={DE:Multi-select Custom Field Name}<br>group.0.valueformat=HTML<br>textmode=true</pre>

1. Replace "Multi-select Custom Field Name" with the actual name of your multi-select custom field, as it appears in Workfront.&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. Click **Save and Close**.  
   The objects in the report are grouped by the values of the multi-select custom field.  
   The name of the groupings of the report are the names of the multi-select custom field followed by the values selected in the field.&nbsp;
