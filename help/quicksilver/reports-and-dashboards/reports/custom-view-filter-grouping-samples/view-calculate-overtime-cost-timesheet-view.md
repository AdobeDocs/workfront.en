# View: calculate overtime cost in a Timesheet View

Overtime is not calculated by default in Adobe Workfront, but you can create a Timesheet report that calculates overtime.

If the user is associated with a Cost per Hour rate in their profile, you can also calculate the amount of cost for the overtime of that user.  
For information about associating users with Cost per Hour rates, see the article [Configure My Settings](../../../workfront-basics/manage-your-account-and-profile/configuring-your-user-profile/configure-my-settings.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Overtime field that you can add to a Timesheet view in a list or a report displays the information found in the Overtime field of the timesheet. This information is updated manually by a user with access to modify the timesheet. For more information about the Overtime field in a timesheet, see the article [Understand the Timesheet layout](../../../timesheets/timesheets/timesheet-layout.md).

## Access requirements

   >[!NOTE]
