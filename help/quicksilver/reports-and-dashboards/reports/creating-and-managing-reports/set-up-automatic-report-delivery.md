You can schedule reports to automatically deliver to users on a defined schedule, or you can manually send reports on a one-time basis. When you send a report from Adobe Workfront, the user receives an email with the Workfront report in a separate attachment.

For more information, including size limitations that can affect the delivery of your reports, see [Report delivery overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/set-up-report-deliveries.md).

## Schedule a report delivery


To schedule a report for automatic delivery:â€‹

{{step1-to-reports}}

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Report deliveries do not contain prompts. If you wish to limit data in a report delivery, we recommend applying filters to the report that you want to send.

1. On the **Reports** page, select a report.
1. At the top of the screen, click **Report Actions**, then **Send Report** from the drop-down that appears. The **Send Report** dialog box displays.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >To send a report manually at any given time, go to the report, then click **Report Actions** > **Send Report** > **Send Now**.

1. Select the **Repeating Deliveries** tab.
1. (Conditional) To modify an existing repeating report delivery, select the report delivery in the **Repeating Deliveries** section on the right side of the dialog box.
1. Specify the following information:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"> <p>Send to</p> </td> 
      <td> <p>Begin typing the name of the user, group, team, or role who you want to send the report to, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.</p> <p>Or</p> <p>Enter the email address of a person external to the Workfront system who you want to have access to the report.</p> <p>Repeat this process to send the report to multiple users, groups, teams, or roles.</p> <p>Note:  <p>Consider the following when adding report delivery recipients:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li><p>If your organization restricts Workfront notifications to specific email domains, you may only be able to send reports to email addresses listed in the email allowlist.</p> <p>For example, when a user is set as a report recipient and has an email address that was previously permitted, and the allowlist is updated to no longer deliver emails to that domain, the user will no longer receive delivered reports.</p><p>For information on how a Workfront administrator updates the email allowlist, see the section <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-email-allowlist.md#configur" class="MCXref xref">Configure your email allowlist</a>.</p></li> 
         <li> <p>Adding a large number of users as recipients can cause the delivery to fail. If you experience delivery failures, you can schedule multiple report deliveries with smaller groups of users.</p> </li> 
        </ul> </td>

     <tr>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"> <p>Email Message</p> </td> 
      <td> <p>Enter a message to include in the email.</p> <p>By default, the email message is:</p> <p><em>Attached is the [report frequency] report [Name of the report] generated by Workfront on [Date].</em> </p> <p>Note: For reports delivered as an Excel file only, the following message is also added to the email: "Please be aware that with MS Excel (XLS) file types, there is a limit (65,530) on the number of hyperlinks these file types support. If you exceed those limits, your file will not open and it is recommended to resend without the hyperlinks. Please go back to the report scheduler to remove hyperlinks and resend the report." The "please go back to the report scheduler" phrase is a link back to the report.</p> </td>

      <td> <p>Begin typing the name of a user who has access to the report, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.

If you need a report delivered by a specific time, we recommend scheduling the delivery prior to the time that it is needed. In general, we recommend scheduling the delivery at least a day prior to the date when it is needed.</p> </td>

   </table>

1. Click **Save** to save the report delivery. The report displays in the **Repeating Deliveries** section of the **Send Report** dialog box and will send at the scheduled time.

   For information about size limitations that can affect the delivery of your reports, see the sections [Report delivery limits](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/set-up-report-deliveries.md#understanding-export-limits) and [Export limits](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/set-up-report-deliveries.md#export).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Scheduled reports are subject to an internal time limit when being processed for delivery. In the event a report takes longer than the limit to be sent, you will receive a notification and the report will no longer be delivered regardless of any remaining scheduled deliveries. To continue sending the report, first try reducing the size of the report through filters and views, then create a new scheduled delivery.
>
>If you are using a scheduled report delivery to analyze Workfront data through a BI tool, we recommend using Workfront Data Connect instead. For more information, see [Workfront Data Connect overview](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/data-lake/data-lake-overview.md).
