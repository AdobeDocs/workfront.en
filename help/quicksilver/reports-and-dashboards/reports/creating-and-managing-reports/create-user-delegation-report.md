# Create a User Delegation report

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: consider moving this to the Custom&nbsp;View, Filter, Grouping Samples section as an example of a report)</p>
-->

In Adobe Workfront, users can delegate project, task, and issue approvals to other users to make sure that their approvals are managed when they are out of office. Users with a Plan license can create a User Delegation report to see:

* Who has delegated their task, issue, and project approvals to another user
* Which users have delegated task, issue, and project approvals assigned to them  

* The dates that the delegations start and end

To learn more about delegating approvals, see [Delegate approval request](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/delegate-approval-requests.md).
