# Report on the Updates area

The Journal Entry report surfaces system updates from the Updates area of projects, tasks, issues, and other objects that were previously only available through the Adobe Workfront API. While this is an advanced report intended for specific use cases, the more digestible format makes it easier for you to report on project activity and system updates within Workfront.

>[!TIP]
>
>The Journal Entry report contains only system updates from the Updates area of objects. To report on comments left in the Updates area, you must use the Note report.  
>For more information on the Note report, see [View all updates in a Note report](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/view-all-updates-in-a-report.md).‍

The Journal Entry report can show:

* How many status changes occurred
* When a task or issue was deleted
* How values in important custom fields changed over the course of a project's life cycle
* What important dates changed over the course of a project's life cycle
* If the owner of a project changed

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars</p> <p>Edit access to Filters,&nbsp;Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions to the objects that contain the journal entries you display in the report</p> <p>You will obtain Manage permissions to the report after you create it</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you can perform the actions described in this article, you must make sure of the following:

* Any fields that you want to report on are tracked in Workfront. You can only report on data from the Updates area that is tracked.

  To learn how to add fields that you want Workfront to track, see [Configure system updates](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/system-tracked-update-feeds/configure-system-updates.md).

* Any custom fields that you want to report on have the setting **Display field changes in update feeds** enabled.

  To learn how to enable this setting for a custom field, see the section [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md#create) in the article [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

## Journal Entry report overview

Because the Journal Entry report queries system updates, it can return a significant number of results. For this reason, we recommend that you filter to specific objects—such as projects, programs, portfolios, groups, and so forth—when creating the report.

To learn more about the different object types in Workfront, see [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because the Journal Entry report returns so much data, exporting and scheduled report delivery are not supported.

The default view for this report contains the following columns:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Field</th> 
   <th>Explanation</th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Field Name</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The name of the affected field. Depending on how you set up the report, this column could contain Status, Owner ID, Task Name, Planned Completion Date, or other fields.</span> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">When</span> <strong>DE</strong>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"> displays in this column, it indicates that the field listed is a custom field.</span></p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Change Type</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>The type of change made to the affected field. Depending on the filter rules that you set up and the actions taken by users, the following might appear in this field:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p>Add</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>Audit</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>Delete</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>Digest</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>Edit</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>Restore</p> </li> 
    </ul> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Top ObjCode</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>The highest parent object in the hierarchy.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Scope</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>The type of object that was changed.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Entry Date</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>The date that the field was changed.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Edited by Name</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>The user that changed the field.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

To organize the information in this report, you can use the built-in grouping Project. The Project grouping gives you a primary grouping of Project Name and a secondary grouping of Entry Date. You can apply this existing grouping during report creation, or you can apply it when viewing the report.

To learn how to set up the views, filters, and groupings you want for your report, see the relevant section:

<!--
<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<p>(NOTE: from&nbsp;Luke: Take this for what it's worth, but part of me wonders if all of these subsections should be separate articles.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for breaking these up would be searchability, in my mind. For example, as a user, I might want to know how to see if the owner of a project changed. If I search the help site for that, I would be a lot more likely to find a separate article called "See if the owner of a project changed" vs an article titled "Create a Journal Entry report" because "Journal Entry" might mean nothing to me.) </p>
</div>
-->

* [See what status changes occurred](#see-what-status-changes-occurred) 
* [See when a task or issue was deleted](#see-when-a-task-or-issue-was-deleted) 
* [See how custom fields changed over the course of a project's life cycle](#see-how-custom-fields-changed-over-the-course-of-a-project-s-life-cycle)

* [See if the owner of a project changed](#see-if-the-owner-of-a-project-changed)

## See what status changes occurred {#see-what-status-changes-occurred}

You can set up the Journal Entry report to show:

* How many status changes were made on a project, task, or issue

* What the previous status was before the change
* Who changed the status
* When the status change took place

If you want to see the health of a project, you could also set up the report to show this same information using the project **Condition** field.

This information can be used to help with auditing and to illustrate how well you and your organization are planning.
