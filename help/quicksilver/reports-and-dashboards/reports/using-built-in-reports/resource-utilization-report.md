# Overview of the Resource Utilization report

<!--Audited: 11/2024-->

<!--CONTEXT SENSITIVE HELP - this is linked to the product. It is about a Resource reporting built-in report, so we need to keep it in both areas.-->

Utilization reports enable you to view the progress or cost of one or more projects in a single report.

You must have Manage access to the projects in order to access utilization information in the Utilization section of the Resourcing area. If you are still unable to access this information, contact your Adobe Workfront administrator.

For information about how to access and use the utilization report, see the article [View resource utilization information](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-utilization/view-utilization-information.md).
