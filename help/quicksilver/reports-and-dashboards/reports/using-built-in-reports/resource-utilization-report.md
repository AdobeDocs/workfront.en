Utilization reports enable you to view the progress or cost of one or more projects in a single report.

You must have Manage access to the projects in order to access utilization information in the Utilization section of the Resourcing area . If you are still unable to access this information, contact your Adobe Workfront administrator.

For information about how to access and use the utilization report, see the article [View resource utilization information](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-utilization/view-utilization-information.md)
