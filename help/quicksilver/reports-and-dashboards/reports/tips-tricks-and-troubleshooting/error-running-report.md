## Problem

When running a report, or displaying it in a dashboard, the following error returns:  
*Let's try that again. You are not currently logged in.*

No results are displayed in the report.

## Cause

The report is currently set to run as a deactivated user.

## Solution

You must have Manage permissions to the report to be able to change the report settings.  
To adjust the report and see the results:

1. Go to the report.
1. Click **Report Actions** > **Edit** > **Report Settings**.

1. Specify the name of an active user in the **Run this report with the Access Rights of:** field.  
   Or  
   Leave the **Run this report with the Access Rights of:** field blank.

1. Click **Done**.
1. Click **Save + Close**.  
   The error should not appear again when running this report.
