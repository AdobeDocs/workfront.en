# Groupings overview in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

Groupings allow you to manage the layout of the information in your reports and lists.

## Create groupings in the builder interface

You can create a grouping using the standard builder  or beta builder  interface in the following ways:

* From scratch
* Modify an existing grouping
* Copy an existing grouping

For information about creating a grouping using the builder interface, see [Create groupings in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-groupings.md).

## Understand groupings in Adobe Workfront

By default, the grouping name appears highlighted in&nbsp;your report or list. The results of the report or list are listed under their individual grouping, with no highlight.

You can add up to three groupings to a report or list. You can organize your information with up to four groupings by creating a matrix report. For more information on matrix reports, see [Create a matrix report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-matrix-report.md).

In a grouping, the first grouping is darker  gray  and the second and third groupings are lighter  gray .  All groupings appear the same, whether they were created in the standard builder or the beta builder. You cannot customize the color of the highlight for your grouping, or the font of the grouping name. The number in parentheses after the grouping name represents the number of results under that grouping. If your report or list spans multiple pages, ensure that you display *All* the results to get an accurate count for your results under each grouping.

Consider the following when working with groupings:

* You can customize the information in existing groupings. All users who can view the groupings can also see your changes.
* Your Workfront administrator must grant you access to edit filters, views, and groupings to create groupings.

  For information about granting access, see [Grant access to filters, views, and groupings](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-fvg.md).

* Your level of permissions to a grouping dictates how a grouping is saved. If you created the grouping originally, you can save the changes; otherwise you are prompted to save a version of the grouping. If you make changes to a grouping you have shared with others it impacts them as well.
* You can customize a grouping that was shared with you only if the user who shared it granted you Manage access.&nbsp;For information about sharing a grouping, see [Share a filter, view, or grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/share-filter-view-grouping.md).
* You cannot edit a grouping inline.
* You cannot group by multi-select custom fields (for example, check boxes), or by fields that can have multiple values (for example, Resource Manager).

## Additional information about groupings

You can further manage report information when using groupings by aggregating the values in each column on the grouping row, as well as sort your information by the field of your grouping. You can also remove a grouping when it is no longer needed.

* [Aggregate values in groupings](#aggregate-values-in-groupings) 
* [Sort by a grouping](#sort-by-a-grouping) 
* [Remove a grouping](#remove-a-grouping)

### Aggregate values in groupings {#aggregate-values-in-groupings}

You can aggregate&nbsp;the data displayed in your report in your grouping line by summarizing the values in each column of the report. For more information about summarizing column data in a grouping, see [Views overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/views-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The following exceptions apply for parent objects (for example, parent tasks) when you are aggregating values for the following fields in groupings:
>
>* All the number and currency fields except Actual Hours (for example, Planned/ Actual Labor Cost, Planned/ Actual Expense Cost, Planned/ Actual Cost, Planned Hours) aggregate only the values for the children tasks, and standalone tasks. They do not aggregate the values for the parent tasks or parents of parents. 
>* Actual Hours aggregate the values for the main parent and the standalone tasks; they do not aggregate the numbers for the parents of parent tasks or the children tasks. 
>* Custom data fields for number and currency values aggregate all tasks: parents, children, parents of parents, and standalone tasks. 
>

### Sort by a grouping {#sort-by-a-grouping}

Groupings cannot be sorted. Views can be sorted. In order to sort&nbsp;a list by the value captured in the grouping, you must include that same value in one of the columns of the view and apply the sorting in the view. This way, the list sorts by the value in the grouping indirectly (it sorts by the value in the view which is also captured in the grouping). For more information about creating views and sorting by values inside the views, see [Views overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/views-overview.md).

### Remove a grouping {#remove-a-grouping}

How you remove a grouping&nbsp;depends on whether you initially created the grouping,&nbsp;or the grouping&nbsp;was shared with you.&nbsp;You cannot remove&nbsp;a default grouping.

* **If you created the grouping and you remove it**, the grouping&nbsp;is removed from the Workfront system. The grouping&nbsp;is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with.
* **If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it**, the grouping&nbsp;is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping.

For information about removing a grouping, see the article [Remove filters, views, and groupings](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/remove-filters-views-groupings.md).
