# Reporting elements overview

<!-- Audited: 11/2024 -->

All Adobe Workfront reports and lists are a combination of three essential elements:

* A view
* A filter
* A grouping

Optionally, you can also add prompts and charts to reports.

For information about creating prompts, see [Add a prompt to a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/add-prompt-report.md).

For information about creating a chart in a report, see [Add a chart to a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/add-chart-report.md).
