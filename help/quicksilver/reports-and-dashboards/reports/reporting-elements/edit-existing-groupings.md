# Edit existing groupings

You can customize an existing grouping that you originally created or that was shared with you. Then, you can save it as a new grouping.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars to edit a grouping in a report</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to a report to edit a grouping in a report</p> <p>Manage permissions to a grouping </p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must create a grouping before you can edit it.

For information on creating a grouping, see [Create groupings in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-groupings.md).

## Walk-through

View the following video to learn how to edit existing groupings.
This video was recorded in Adobe Workfront Classic. However, the content also applies to the new Workfront experience.

## How-to steps

1. Go to a list of objects that contains the grouping that you want to customize.
1. Click the `Grouping`icon.
1. Select the grouping that you want to customize, then click the Edit icon.

   The interface builder for customizing the grouping opens. 

1. In the `Grouping Preview` section, click `Add Grouping` to define how you want information in the report to be organized. A preview of what the grouping looks like in the report is shown below.

1. Begin typing the name of the field that represents the way that you want to organize information in the report, then click it when it appears in the drop-down list.
1. (Optional and conditional) When viewing an updated list, select Collapse this grouping by default if you want the results in the grouping to display collapsed rather than expanded. This setting is disabled by default and the results of the grouping always display in the expanded list. For information about updated and legacy lists, see the section "The difference between updated and legacy lists" in the article Get started with lists in Adobe Workfront. Tips: When you manually adjust groupings when viewing a list, Workfront remembers your manual preference until you log out. When you log back in, the list displays according to this setting. The results of a grouping always display expanded after accessing them from a chart element or in a legacy list. In these cases, this setting is ignored. 
1. Repeat Steps 4, 5, and 6 to define additional groupings.  
   You can define up to three groupings for organizing information. You can further organize your information with up to four groupings by creating a matrix report. For more information on matrix reports, see [Create a matrix report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-matrix-report.md).

1. Click `Save`as New `Grouping` to replace the current grouping with your changes.
