# Views overview in Adobe Workfront

You can customize the type of information you display in a list or report by managing the view of the list or report. You can display objects and their attributes in a view. For information about the objects of Adobe Workfront, see [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md).

## Considerations about views

* You can customize existing views. All users who can view the views can also see your changes.
* Your Adobe Workfront administrator must grant you access to edit filters, views, and groupings to be able to create views.

  For information about granting edit access, see [Grant access to filters, views, and groupings](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-fvg.md).

* Your level of permissions to a view dictates how a view is saved. If you created the view originally, you can save the changes, otherwise you are prompted to save a version of the view. If you make changes to a view you have shared with others it impacts them as well.
* You can customize a view that was shared with you only if the user who shared it granted you Manage access. For information about sharing a view, see [Share a filter, view, or grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/share-filter-view-grouping.md).

You can customize existing views, create new views based on existing views, or create new views from scratch.

## Types of views in Workfront

The following are types of views that you can apply in lists or reports in Workfront: 

<table style="table-layout:auto">
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Standard views</strong></td>
        <td>You can apply them to any list or report of objects. Standard views are highly customizable. You can customize and share a standard view with others. For information see, <a href="/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-edit-views.md">Create or edit views in Adobe Workfront</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Agile view</strong></td>
        <td>You can apply it to a list of tasks in the Tasks section of a project. You can customize and share an agile view with others. For information, see <a href="/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-edit-views.md">Create or edit views in Adobe Workfront</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Gantt view</strong></td>
        <td>You can apply it to a list of tasks in the Tasks section of a project, a list of projects, or add it to a task or project report. You can customize what information you view in the Gantt view using predefined built-in options. All users with access to view tasks or projects can view them in the Gantt view. For information, see <a href="/help/quicksilver/manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/get-started-with-gantt.md">Get started with the Gantt Chart</a>.</td>
       </tr>
</table>

<!--NOTE FOR MAYBE LATER: consider adding calendar and board views to this list of views (above)?! -->

<h2>Create or customize a view</h2>
<p>(NOTE: drafted, because it has been moved to its own article: create-edit-views.htm) </p>
<p>The process for creating or customizing a view differs depending on whether you are creating or customizing a standard view or an agile view.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Create or customize a standard view</strong></p>
<p>You can create a new standard view, or you can customize an existing standard view that you previously created.</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Click the<strong>View</strong> drop-down menu on any list where you want to create or customize a view.</li>
<li value="2">(Optional) To customize an existing view, select the standard View you want to customize.<br>Standard Views are available on any type of list in Workfront, such as a report, project list, or task list.</li>
<li value="3">Click the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu, then click <strong>Customize View</strong> or<strong>New View</strong>.<br>The <strong>Customize View</strong> dialog box displays.<br></li>
<li value="4"> <p>In the <strong>Column Preview</strong> section, do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify the value of any column by clicking the column title and then selecting a new field.</li>
<li>Add a column by clicking <strong>Add Column</strong>, begin typing the name of the column that you want to add, then click it when it appears in the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Adjust the order that columns appear by dragging the column title to a new location.
<ul>
<li>(Optional) In the <strong>Column Settings</strong> area, click the <strong>Summarize this column by</strong> drop-down list, then select one of the available options for summarizing the information. When you choose this option, the information in your column is aggregated in the groupings of the report.<br>For date fields, you can summarize the values by the following options:
<ul>
<li>Maximum</li>
<li>Minimum</li>
</ul><p>For number and currency fields, you can summarize the values by the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count</li>
<li>Sum</li>
<li>Average</li>
<li>Maximum</li>
<li>Minimum</li>
</ul> <note type="note">  
<p>The following exceptions apply for parent objects (for example, parent tasks) when you are aggregating values for the following fields in groupings:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the number and currency fields except Actual Hours (for example, Planned/ Actual Labor Cost, Planned/ Actual Expense Cost, Planned/ Actual Cost, Planned Hours) aggregate only the values for the children tasks, and standalone tasks. They do not aggregate the values for the parent tasks or parents of parents.</li>
<li>Actual Hours aggregate the values for the main parent and the standalone tasks; they do not aggregate the numbers for the parents of parent tasks or the children tasks.</li>
<li>Custom data fields for number and currency values aggregate all tasks: parents, children, parents of parents, and standalone tasks.</li>

<p>(NOTE: Alina: [! The information in the following steps is more or less duplicated in "Creating and Managing Agile Teams."]) </p>

<li value="5">In the <strong>Customize Agile View</strong> dialog box, specify a name for the Agile view.<br>We recommend that you include the word "Agile" in your view name, so users know this is an Agile view.<br>This name is displayed in the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu when selecting a view.</li>
<li value="6"> <p>Define the status columns to display on the story board in the agile view. These are the task statuses that are defined by the Workfront administrator, as described in <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or edit a status</a>.</p> <p>Only system statuses are available to use on the Agile story board. If a status is available only for an individual group you are a member of, the status is not available on the agile story board. Furthermore, tasks that are in a status that is available only to a custom group are not visible when viewing the project in an Agile view.</p> <p>Users can move stories among these status columns on the Agile story board.<br>When defining status columns, you can do the following:</p> <p>

## Share a view

For information about how to share a view, see [Share a filter, view, or grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/share-filter-view-grouping.md).

## Remove a view

The ability to remove a view functions differently depending on whether you initially created the view, or the view was shared with you. You cannot remove a default view.

For more information, see [Remove filters, views, and groupings](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/remove-filters-views-groupings.md).
