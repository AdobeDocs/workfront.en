# Views overview in Adobe Workfront

<!--Audited: 01/2024-->

You can customize the type of information you display in a list or report by managing the view of the list or report. You can display objects and their attributes in a view. For information about the objects of Adobe Workfront, see [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md).

## Considerations about views

* You can customize existing views. All users who can view the views can also see your changes.
* Your Adobe Workfront administrator must grant you access to edit filters, views, and groupings to be able to create views.

  For information about granting access, see [Grant access to filters, views, and groupings](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-fvg.md).

* Your level of permissions to a view dictates how a view is saved. If you created the view originally, you can save the changes, otherwise you are prompted to save a version of the view. If you make changes to a view you have shared with others it impacts them as well.
* You can customize a view that was shared with you only if the user who shared it granted you Manage access. For information about sharing a view, see [Share a filter, view, or grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/share-filter-view-grouping.md).

You can customize existing views, create views based on existing views, or create views from scratch.

## Types of views in Workfront

The following are types of views that you can apply in lists or reports in Workfront: 

<table style="table-layout:auto">
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Standard views</strong></td>
        <td>You can apply them to any list or report of objects. Standard views are highly customizable. You can customize and share a standard view with others. For information see, <a href="/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-edit-views.md">Create or edit views in Adobe Workfront</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Agile view</strong></td>
        <td>You can apply it to a list of tasks in the Tasks section of a project. You can customize and share an agile view with others. For information, see <a href="/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/create-edit-views.md">Create or edit views in Adobe Workfront</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Gantt view</strong></td>
        <td>You can apply it to a list of tasks in the Tasks section of a project, a list of projects, or add it to a task or project report. You can customize what information you view in the Gantt view using predefined built-in options. All users with access to view tasks or projects can view them in the Gantt view. For information, see <a href="/help/quicksilver/manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/get-started-with-gantt.md">Get started with the Gantt Chart</a>.</td>
       </tr>
</table>

<!--NOTE FOR MAYBE LATER: consider adding calendar and board views, or Milestone view (not customizable) to this list of views (above)?! -->

## Share a view

For information about how to share a view, see [Share a filter, view, or grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/share-filter-view-grouping.md).

## Remove a view

The ability to remove a view functions differently depending on whether you initially created the view, or the view was shared with you. You cannot remove a default view.

For more information, see [Remove filters, views, and groupings](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/remove-filters-views-groupings.md).
