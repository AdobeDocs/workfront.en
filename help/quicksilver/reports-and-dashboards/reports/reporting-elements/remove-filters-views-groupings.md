# Remove filters, views, and groupings

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

<!--
You can remove a filter, view, or grouping from the drop-down menus of lists and reports if you created them or they have been shared with you. You cannot remove default filters, views, or groupings. Walk-through View the following video to learn how to remove filters, views, and groupings in Adobe Workfront. Note: The video describes how to remove a grouping. However, removing views and filters is identical to removing a grouping. This video was recorded in Workfront Classic. However, the content also applies to the new Workfront experience. How-to steps How you remove a reporting element depends on whether you initially created it, or it was shared with you. For example, when removing a grouping: If you created the grouping and you remove it, the grouping is removed from the Workfront system. The grouping is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with. If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it, the grouping is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping. To remove a filter, view, or grouping: Go to a list of objects or a report. In the Grouping, Filter, or View drop-down menus, click Remove Grouping, Remove Filter, or Remove View. The My Groupings, My Filters, or My Viewsdialog box displays. All reporting elements that you have rights to remove are available to remove. Other reporting elements are displayed as dimmed. Click the x icon next to any reporting element that you want to remove, then click Done.

## Considerations about removing filters, views, and groupings

How you remove a reporting element depends on whether you initially created it, or it was shared with you.

The following scenarios exist when you remove a grouping:

* `If you created the grouping and you remove it`, the grouping is removed from the Workfront system. The grouping is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with.
* `If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it`, the grouping is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping.

## Remove a filter, view, or grouping 

<!--
using the standard builder

You can remove a filter, view, or a grouping for all lists of objects using the standard builder interface.

1. Go to a list of objects or a report.
1. (Conditional) From a report, click the `Grouping`, `Filter`, or `View` drop-down menu and select `Remove Grouping`, `Remove Filter`, or `Remove View`.

   The `My Groupings`, `My Filters,` or `My Views` dialog box displays.

   All reporting elements that you have rights to remove are available to remove. Other reporting elements are displayed as dimmed.

1. Click the `x` icon next to any reporting element that you want to remove. 
1. (Conditional) Click `Yes, Delete it` if you selected to delete a filter, view, or grouping that you created and later shared with others.&nbsp;This deletes the filter, view, or grouping from the Workfront system.
