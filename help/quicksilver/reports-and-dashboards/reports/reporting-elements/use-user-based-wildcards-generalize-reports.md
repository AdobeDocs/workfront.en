# Use user-based wildcards to generalize reports

You can generalize a report by using wildcards instead of specific information when building certain reporting elements. For example, if you want to create a report that shows the tasks assigned to a specific user, you can use the user's name in the Assigned To field of the filter. However, if you want to create a report that shows tasks assigned to the logged in user, regardless of who that user is, you can use a wildcard that indicates that when someone views the report it displays information pertaining only to them. This way, you build the report once but because you use a wildcard in the filter it produces different results every time someone else reads it.

You can use user-based wildcards when building the following reporting elements:

* Filters
* Custom prompts
* Views when adding rules for columns

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Access level configurations*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars to edit reporting elements in a report</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Object permissions</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to a report to edit reporting elements in a report</p> <p>Manage permissions to a view or filter to edit them</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must create a report before you can add a wildcard variable to it.

For instructions on creating reports, see [Create a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-report.md).

## How-to steps

To insert a user-based wildcard in a report:

1. Go to a report for which you want to insert a user-based wildcard.
1. Click **Report Actions**, then **Edit**.

1. Click the **Filters** tab.
1. Click **Add a Filter Rule**.
1. Start typing the name of the field that you want to filter by.  
   You must type fields that reference the user object or information about users.
1. Select **Equal** in the drop-down menu for the filter variable.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You must always select the **Equal** filter variable when working with wildcards in Adobe Workfront.

1. In the **Start typing name ...** box, type: `$$USER.ID` or `$$USER.name` if you want the report to display information about the user who logs in, based on their name. You can insert other wildcards that refer to the logged-in user's Group, Team, Company, or other information.

   For a complete list of user-based wildcards, see [Wildcard filter variables overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/understand-wildcard-filter-variables.md).

1. Click **Save + Close**.
