# Copy a calendar report

If you created a calendar, you can copy the calendar and use it as a starting point for a new calendar.

Additionally, if you have [!UICONTROL Manage] access to a calendar to which you are not the owner, you can copy the calendar and become the owner of the copied calendar.

   All the projects and calendar groupings in the original calendar display in the copy of the calendar. Only objects placed by calendar filters export to the newly copied calendar. Any events manually added to the original calendar must be manually added to the copied calendar.

   Only you have access to the copied calendar. Users with access to the original calendar do not have access to the copied calendar. You can grant access to the newly-created calendar by sharing it with other users. To learn about sharing calendars, see [[!UICONTROL Share a calendar] report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/share-a-calendar-report.md).

1. (Optional) Rename the calendar.
