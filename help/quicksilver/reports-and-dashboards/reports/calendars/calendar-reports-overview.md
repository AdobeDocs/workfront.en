# Calendar reports overview

<!-- Audited: 01/2024 -->

A calendar report is a dynamic report that provides a visual representation of your work. You can display date information in a calendar report for the following objects:

* Tasks
* Issues
* Projects

Your ability to access calendar reports in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] is determined through your access level. For more information about the access needed to view calendar reports, see [Grant access to reports, dashboards, and calendars](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-reports-dashboards-calendars.md).

## Create your own calendars

[!DNL Workfront] automatically creates your default personal calendar when:

* You are a newly created user who has no access to any other calendars and you visit the calendar report page for the first time

  OR

* You manually delete all calendars and have no access to any other calendars

>[!NOTE]
>
>The personal calendar is not created if you have access to any other calendars, such as a system-wide shared calendar or calendars shared specifically with you.

In addition, you can create calendars and access calendars shared with you by other users. There is no limit to the number of calendars that you can have access to in [!DNL Workfront].

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must have [!UICONTROL Edit] access to [!UICONTROL Reports], [!UICONTROL Dashboards], and [!UICONTROL Calendars] in your access level to create a calendar report. Contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator for more information.

## Group items together by dates

Within each calendar report, you can create groups of items that allow you to narrow the focus of the calendar. For example, you could have a calendar grouping that displays the dates for all tasks on a specific project, the marketing team members currently working on the project, and the overdue issues assigned to the project team. For more information, see the following articles:

* [Use [!UICONTROL Planned Dates] in a calendar report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/use-planned-dates.md)
* [Use [!UICONTROL Projected Dates] in a calendar report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/use-projected-dates.md)
* [Use custom date fields in a calendar report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/use-custom-dates.md)

>[!NOTE]

>If you see a 504 error when running a calendar report, you probably have too many filters in the report. Reducing the number of filters should allow the report to run.
