# Calendar reports overview

A calendar report is actually a dynamic report that provides a visual representation of your work.&nbsp;You can display date information in a calendar report for the following objects:

* Tasks
* Issues
* Projects

Your ability to access calendar reports in Adobe Workfront is determined by the Workfront administrator through your access level. For more information about the access level needed to view calendar reports, see [Grant access to reports, dashboards, and calendars](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-reports-dashboards-calendars.md).

## Create your own calendars

Workfront automatically creates a default personal calendar when:

* A newly created user who has no access to any other calendars visits the calendar report page for the first time  
  OR
* A user manually deletes all calendars and has no access to any other calendars

>[!NOTE]
>
>The personal calendar is not created if the user has access to any other calendars, such as a system-wide shared calendar or calendars shared specifically with the user.

In addition, users can create calendars and access calendars shared with them by other users. There is no limit to the number of calendars to which a user can have access to in Workfront.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must have Edit access to Reports, Dashboards, and Calendars in your access level to create a calendar report. Contact your Workfront administrator.

## Group items together by dates

Within each calendar report, you can create groups of items that allow you to narrow the focus of the calendar. For example, you could have a calendar grouping that displays the dates for all tasks on a specific project, the marketing team members currently working on the project, and the overdue issues assigned to the project team. For more information, see the following articles:

* [Use Planned Dates in a calendar report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/use-planned-dates.md) 
* [Use Projected Dates in a calendar report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/use-projected-dates.md) 
* [Use custom date fields in a calendar report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/use-custom-dates.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you see a 504 error when running a calendar report, you probably have too many filters in the report. Reducing the number of filters should allow the report to run.

## Add your calendars to a dashboard

You can have quick access to your calendar reports by displaying them on a dashboard. To learn how to add a calendar to a dashboard, see [Edit a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/edit-dashboard.md).
