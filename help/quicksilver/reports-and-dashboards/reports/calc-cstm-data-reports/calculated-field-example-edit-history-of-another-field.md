# Calculated custom field example: display a field's edit history

If users update custom fields on a regular basis and you want to capture a log of all the changes made to a field as well as a date when the changes happen, you can capture this information in a calculated custom field.

The following example shows you how to build the *Instructions Edit History* calculated field to capture all the change made to a single-line text field called *Instructions*.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can follow this example for all types of custom fields, not just single-line text fields.

This does this following:&nbsp;

* Limits the *Instructions Edit History* field to the most recent 2000 characters to stay within the Workfront database limit. 
* Checks if the current value of the *Instructions* field matches the front of the *Instructions Edit History* value; it assumes it is blank and if it is not, it does the following:&nbsp;

   * If they match, it leaves the *Instructions Edit History* as is; 
   * If they do not match, it replaces the *Instructions Edit History* with the latest value in the *Instructions* field, followed by the current date in parentheses, a vertical bar, and the previous *Instructions Edit History*, which preserves the previous value(s) and the date(s) when they were entered.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <caption style="text-align: left;"> 
  <p>*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.</p> 
 </caption> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <p>Adobe Workfront plan*</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <p>Workfront license*</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Access level configurations*</strong> </td> 
   <td> <p>Administrative access to Custom&nbsp;Forms</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## Prerequisites

To add a calculated field that displays a field's edit history to a custom form, you must first:

* Create the custom form 
* Add the field whose history you want to capture to the custom form

## Display a field's edit history

1. Go to a custom form where you want to add the calculated field.

1. To create the single-line text custom field, for example, do the following:

   1. Click&nbsp;**Single Line Text Field**.
   1. Specify a **Label** for the custom field, such as *Instructions*.
   1. Click&nbsp;**Applye**.

1. Select **Add a field**, then select **Calculated** to add a calculated custom field to the form.
1. Specify a **Label** for the calculated custom field, such as *Instructions Edit History*.

   This is the field that will capture any changes made to the first field you created (*Instructions*).

1. Click **Save + Close**.
1. Click the name of the form where you have now added two fields to re-open it.
1. Click the calculated custom field *Instructions Edit History,* then copy and paste the following in the Calculation box:
1. In the **Calculation** field, specify the following calculation for your custom field:

   ```
   LEFT(IF(LEFT({DE:Instructions Edit History},LEN(IF(ISBLANK({DE:Instructions}),"-",{DE:Instructions})))={DE:Instructions},{DE:Instructions Edit History},CONCAT(IF(ISBLANK({DE:Instructions}),"-",{DE:Instructions})," (",$$NOW,") | ",{DE:Instructions Edit History})),2000)
   ```

1. (Recommended) Paste the same calculation in the **Instructions** field on the calculated field on the form. 
1. Make sure that &nbsp;**Text** is selected in the **Format** field to format the calculated custom field as text.
   
   This is the default. 

1. Click **Save+Close**.

   Now, when you attach the custom form to an object and then someone changes the information in the *Instructions* field, the *Instructions Edit History" field displays the latest value, followed by the current date in parentheses, and a vertical bar. If further changes are made, they are added to this information in the same way.

   In the above calculation, you can replace *Instructions* with the exact name of your single-line text field whose history you want to track, and *Instructions Edit History* with the exact name of your calculated field.
