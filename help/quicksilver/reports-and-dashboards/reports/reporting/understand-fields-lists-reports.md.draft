<p>After 18.2, when the Resource Budgeted Hours might come back, this needs to be added back in:</p>
<p>Planned Budgeted Hours =&nbsp;In a Resource Budgeted Hour report, the Planned Budgeted Hours are the hours budgeted for a project, job role, or user in the Resource Planner.&nbsp;For more information about budgeting hours in the Resource Planner, see the "Budgeting Allocations in the Resource Planner" section in "Planning in the Resource Planner.") </p>

<note type="important">  This article should be used as a reference to understand the fields that are visible through the report builder in Workfront. The fields available in the report builder are listed in the following table in alphabetical order. We are currently&nbsp;updating this information and as a result this table might not be complete. We will remove this disclaimer when we consider this information exhaustive.&nbsp;
</note>
-->

Workfront fields are available to be configured in the following reporting elements:

* Views
* Filters
* Groupings
* Prompts

For more information about reporting elements, see the article [Reporting elements overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/reporting-elements-overview.md).

For more information about building reports, see[Create and manage reports](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-manage-reports.md).

When creating a report, you can select what objects or fields associated with those objects you want to show in your report. Those will become your report columns, groupings, filters, or prompts. You can build standalone views, filters, and groupings for lists of objects, as well, in the same manner you would build them inside the report builder.&nbsp;

![Build views filters or groupings](assets/4-350x176.png)

The following table is a list of commonly used objects and fields that you can display in reports and lists. Not all fields are available on all objects:&nbsp;&nbsp;

<tr>
<td> <p>Actual Hours</p> </td>
<td> <p>In a project, task, or issue report, Actual Hours are the sum of all hours logged on the project, task, or issue.&nbsp;</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <p>Allocation Date</p> </td>
<td> <p>You can find this field in the following types of reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Estimates</li>
<li>Project (Financial Data)</li>
<li>Budgeted Hour</li>
</ul> <p>For a Resource Estimates or Project (Financial Data) report: </p>
<ul>
<li>Build these reports when trying to understand how resources are budgeted for work, or the amount of Planned Hours that is assigned to your resources.</li>
<li> <p>The Allocation Date is the first day (Sunday) of a week in which the allocation of a Job Role to a task starts. A resource (Job Role) can have as many Allocation Dates as it has weeks during the Duration of the tasks that it is assigned to. If tasks span over multiple months, then the first day of a month can also become an Allocation Date, if it falls within the Duration of the task.&nbsp;</p> <p>For example, you can have a Job Role assigned to a task that spans over 3 weeks and has 90 Planned Hours. These hours are spread evenly during the duration of the task, which makes every day assign 6 Planned Hours to your job role:</p> <p><em> Daily Planned Hours = Total Planned Hours/ Number of Work Days during the Duration of the task </em> </p> <p>As a result, there are three Allocation Dates, one for every Sunday of every week during the Duration of the task, each with a certain number of Planned Hours associated with them.<br>If the task starts in the middle of the last week of a month and ends two weeks after the beginning of a new month, the task will have four Allocation Dates: one for every Sunday of every week during the Duration of the task, and one for the first day of the new month.</p> <p>To make the most use of this information, we recommend that you build a Resource Estimates or a Project (Financial Data) report and add a matrix grouping for Allocation Date, and group the results weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly for the most accurate data.<br>For information about building a matrix grouping, see the article <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-matrix-report.md" class="MCXref xref">Create a matrix report</a>.</p> </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>For a Budgeted Hour report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build this report when trying to understand the amount of Budgeted Hours that is allocated to your resources or to your projects in the Resource Planner.</li>
<li> <p>The Allocation Date is the first day (a Sunday) of the week for which you budgeted the hours in the Resource Planner. </p> <note type="tip">  
<p>If a week spans for two months, it will generate two rows in the report: one corresponding to the first day of the week (Sunday of the first week which is during the first month), and the second row displays the first day of the second month. </p>
<p>For example, if you budget 8 hours for a user for the week of June 30 (Sunday) - July 6 (Saturday), the two rows show an Allocation Date of June 30, and July 1. </p>

<td> <p>Planned Duration</p> </td>

If you assign three resources with a full time schedule to the same task, the Duration stays 3 days, but the Planned Duration becomes 1 day. The Planned Duration also changes the Planned Start and Planned Completion dates of the task, to reflect the new Planned Duration. As a result, the timeline of the project is affected as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>For more information about the difference between Duration and Planned Duration for tasks, see the article <a href="../../../manage-work/tasks/task-information/planned-duration-vs-duration-for-tasks.md" class="MCXref xref">Difference between Planned Duration and Duration for tasks</a>.</p> <p>Projects and issues don't have a Planned Duration.&nbsp;</p> </td>
