# Save default reports as new reports

<!-- Audited: 11/2024 -->

You can modify a copy of a default report that is included with your instance of Adobe Workfront and save it as a new report.

After you copy a default report, you become the owner of the copied report and it displays in the My Reports section in the Reports area.

For information about copying a report, see [Create a copy of a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-copy-report.md).
