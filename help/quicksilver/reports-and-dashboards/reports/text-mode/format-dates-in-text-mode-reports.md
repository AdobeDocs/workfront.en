# Format dates in text mode reports

Dates can be configured to display in a variety of formats in reports and lists in Adobe Workfront. To establish a date format, you must modify the `valueformat` line of the text mode code in the column.

`valueformat= [new date format]` For example, if you wanted the Projected Completion Date to be displayed as MM/DD/YY the code would look like:

```
valueformat=atDate
valuefield=projectedCompletionDate
```

If you wanted to show the Planned Completion Date as *Mth, DD, Year*, the code would look like:

```
valueformat=mediumAtdate
valuefield=plannedCompletionDate
```

For more information about applying conditional formatting in Workfront reports and lists using text mode, see [Use conditional formatting in Text Mode](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/use-conditional-formatting-text-mode.md).

You can format dates using the following 

```
valueformat
```

&nbsp;text mode values:

| **Format** |Example&nbsp; |***valueformat=*** |
|---|---|---|
| MM/DD/YY |10/11/18 |`atDate` |
| MM/DD/YY Time |10/11/18 12:00pm |`longAtDate` |
| MM/DD/YY |10/11/18 |`shortAtDate` |
| Mth, DD, YR |Oct, 11, 2018 |`mediumAtDate` |
| DW, Mth, Day, YR |Mon, Oct, 11, 2018 |`partialAtDate` |
| DW, Mth, Day, YR Time |Mon, Oct, 11, 2018 12:00 pm |`fullAtDate` |
