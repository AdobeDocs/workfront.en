# Overview of common uses for Text Mode

<!-- Audited: 1/2024 -->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: Alina: ***This is linked to Understanding Text Mode (article), and the TOC article for examples of various reporting elements)</p>
-->

You can expand your reporting capabilities by using text mode in reports and report elements. You can also use a version of text mode to build more complex calculated custom fields. For more information about text mode, see [Text Mode overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md).

This article outlines just a few common examples of where you would most likely need to use text mode to expand reporting or calculated custom fields capabilities in Adobe Workfront. For a more expansive list of examples, see:

* [Custom view, filter, and grouping samples: article index](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples.md) 
* [Calculated custom data in reports](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-custom-data-reports.md)

For more information about creating reports using text mode, including classes, videos, and tutorials, see the Learn section on the Adobe Experience League site.

## Instances where you might use text mode in lists and reports

We recommend that you use the report and list builder to build your views, filters and groupings. However, there are some instances where you can use text mode to enhance your reports and lists.

You can use text mode when you want to achieve the following in&nbsp;Workfront:

* Build custom calculated custom fields in a custom form.  
  For more information about calculated custom fields, see the [Use Text Mode in calculated custom fields](#use-text-mode-in-calculated-custom-fields) section in this article.
* Enhance filters, views, and groupings beyond what is possible in the report builder. For information about using text mode for filters, views, and groupings, see the following sections in this article:

   * [Use Text Mode in views](#use-text-mode-in-views) 
   * [Use Text Mode in filters](#use-text-mode-in-filters) 
   * [Use Text Mode in groupings](#use-text-mode-in-groupings)

* Create custom prompts. You can only create custom prompts using Text&nbsp;Mode.

  For information about building custom prompts, see [Add a prompt to a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/add-prompt-report.md).

## Use Text Mode in calculated custom fields {#use-text-mode-in-calculated-custom-fields}

You can use text mode to add a calculated custom field to a Custom Form.

For more information about adding a calculated custom field to a Custom Form, see [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

For more information about creating a calculated custom field in text mode, see [Add calculated data to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-calculated-data-to-custom-form.md).

For example, you can add a calculated custom field that shows a time and date stamp of the moment when an item was marked as In Progress. You can use this calculation for other statuses.

For information, see [Calculated custom field example: display a Status timestamp in a Custom Form](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/example-status-timestamp-in-calculated-field.md).

## Use Text Mode in views {#use-text-mode-in-views}

You can use text mode in views to expand on the fields and objects you can display in the view.

For examples of the most common reasons for using text mode in a view, see the following articles:

* [View: display objects that are not included in the standard interface](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-display-objects-not-in-standard-interface.md) 
* [View: display the result of a calculation between two fields in a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-calculation-between-two-fields.md) 
* [View: permanently edit the width of a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-edit-column-width-permanently.md) 
* [View: merge information from multiple columns in one shared column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-merge-columns.md) 
* [View: remove link to an object in a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-remove-link-to-object.md) 
* [Reference collections in a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/reference-collections-report.md) 
* [View: hide the content of a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-hide-column-content.md) 
* [View: display an image instead of a string in a column](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-display-image-in-view.md) 
* [View: display task indentations in a task list](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-display-task-identations.md) 
* [View: calculate time and date differences](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-calculate-time-and-date-differences.md)

<p><strong>Display objects that are not included in the standard interface</strong></p>
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: see new article: /Content/Reports and Dashboards/Reports/Custom View Filter Grouping Samples/view-display-objects-not-in-standard-interface.htm)</p>
<p>You can display objects in a view that are not included in the standard mode interface. Some objects can be included in a view only by referencing them via text mode.<br>You can know which fields can be included in a view in either of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="../../../wf-api/general/api-explorer.md" class="MCXref xref">API Explorer</a> to discover other objects that can be referenced via text mode.<br>Not all the fields documented in the API Explorer are valid fields for text mode. Some fields are only reportable through the API.</li>
<li>A column or field name is not available in the standard mode interface, but the column or field ID is. Most objects that have a column or field ID also have a corresponding column or field name. However, in some cases, only the ID is displayed in the standard mode Interface. You can use text mode to include the column or field name in a view by replacing the <strong>fieldnameID</strong> with the <strong>fieldname:name</strong>.<br>For example, in the standard mode interface, the <strong>Sponsor ID</strong> field is available for a project, but the <strong>Sponsor Name</strong> field is not. You can use text mode to display the <strong>Sponsor Name</strong>, if you switch the <strong>Sponsor ID</strong> column to text mode and replace the text in the column with:<br><pre>valuefield=project:sponsor:name<br>querysort=project:sponsor:name<br>valueformat=HTML<br>displayname=Project Sponsor Name<br>linkedname=project<br>namekey=view.relatedcolumn<br>namekeyargkey.0=project<br>namekeyargkey.1=sponsorID</pre></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make a calculation between two fields in a column</strong></p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: see new article: /Content/Reports and Dashboards/Reports/Custom View Filter Grouping Samples/column-calculation-between-two-fields.htm)</p>
<p>For example, if you want to find out the number of week days that elapsed between two dates, you can use text mode syntax and data expressions to calculate this difference.<br>For example, we want to calculate the week day difference between the Planned Completion Date and the Actual Completion Date of a task.<br>To do this, you can add a new column to a task view, and <strong>Switch to Text Mode</strong>. In the <strong>Click to edit text</strong> dialog box, paste the following text: </p>
<pre>displayname=Week Day Difference<br>textmode=true<br>valueexpression=WEEKDAYDIFF({plannedCompletionDate},{actualCompletionDate})<br>valueformat=HTML</pre>
<p>You can use any other two dates in this calculation (Actual Start, Actual Completion, Projected Start, Projected Completion, etc).<br>For more information about calculated data expressions, see <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-data-expressions.md" class="MCXref xref">Overview of calculated data expressions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit the width of a column permanently</strong></p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: see new article: /Content/Reports and Dashboards/Reports/Custom View Filter Grouping Samples/column-edit-column-width-permanently.htm) </p>
<p>You can permanently change the width of a column by using these lines in the text mode of the column:</p>
<pre>width=200<br>usewidths=true</pre>
<p>For the <strong>width</strong> line, specify any number (in pixels), according to how wide you want the column to display in the report.</p>
<p><strong>Merge multiple columns into a single column</strong></p>

<p>Do the following to share the data from multiple columns to display it in one common column with a line break between the values from each column:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1"> <p>Add a third column between the two columns you want to merge. </p> </li>

<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<h4 id="merge-data-from-two-columns-with-no-line-break">Merge data from two columns with no line break </h4>
<p>You can share the data from multiple separate columns to display it in one column with no breaks or spaces between the values from each column. </p>
<p>To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1"> <p>Add the following text to the first column:</p> <p><code>sharecol=true</code> </p> </li>
</ol> <note type="note">  Consider the following when using shared columns:
<ul>
<li>The <code>valueformat=HTML</code> line is mandatory in a shared column. Otherwise, the columns contain no information (they will be blank) when the report is exported from Workfront.</li>
<li>Conditional formatting may not be supported in merged columns.</li>
<li>Columns with the <strong>viewalias</strong> attribute can limit the amount of columns that you can merge. To avoid these limits, avoid using the <strong>viewalias</strong> attribute. If you must include the <strong>viewalias</strong> attribute in a column, make sure that they are the last item listed in the column.</li>
</ul>
</note>
<p><strong>Remove a link to an object from the view</strong></p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: see this new article: /Content/Reports and Dashboards/Reports/Custom View Filter Grouping Samples/column-remove-link-to-object.htm)</p>
<p>Some objects that you display in a view are links to the Details page of the object, by default. For example, the column that displays the Name of a project is a link to the project; the column that displays the Name of a user is a link to the user profile page.</p>
<p>You can remove this link using text mode.<br>For example, to remove the link to a task in a project report, you may use the following text mode in a column:</p>
<pre>displayname=Task Name<br>linkedname=direct<br>namekey=name<br>querysort=name<br>textmode=true<br>valueexpression={name}<br>valueformat=Compound</pre> <note type="note">  You can use similar code for other objects, and just replace the
<strong>valuefield</strong> line of the code with
<strong>valueexpression</strong>. This removes the link from the view.
</note>
<p><strong>Display a collection in a view</strong></p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: this already has its own article, maybe just list the other article in the TOC of the example) </p>
<p>Display a collection in a report view. A collection is a list of objects that are linked to one other object.<br>For information about displaying a collection in a report view, see the "Reference collections in a View of a report" section in the article <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/reference-collections-report.md" class="MCXref xref">Reference collections in a report</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hide the content of a column in a view</strong></p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: see new article: /Content/Reports and Dashboards/Reports/Custom View Filter Grouping Samples/column-hide-column-content.htm) </p>
<p>You can build a column in a view for purposes of sorting the view by a certain field, but you can use text mode to hide the information inside the column from displaying in the view. In this case, the object in the column helps sort the view, but the information of that object does not display in the view.</p>
<p>For example, to hide the Task Number column in a task report, replace the text in the Task Number column with the following:</p>
<pre><strong>displayname=</strong>linkedname=direct<br>querysort=taskNumber<br>sortOrder=1<br>sortType=asc<br>textmode=true<br><strong>value=</strong>valueformat=int<br><strong>width=0</strong></pre>
<p>The important changes in this code which make the column hidden are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>displayname</code>: This line must be blank.</li>
<li><code>valuefield</code>: This has been replaced by <em>value</em>, and must be blank.</li>
<li><code>width</code>: Depending on the field, this must have a value of <i>0</i> or <i>1</i>.</li>
</ul> <note type="note">  
<ul>
<li>You can use hidden columns to sort by a certain object that you do not want to display in the view.<br>For example, you can sort by Task Number in a task view in the example provided above, and hide the Task Number information from the view.</li>
<li>When you hide a column, note that the information in the column is hidden, but the column still exists in the view.</li>
</ul>

## Use Text Mode in filters {#use-text-mode-in-filters}

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: replace all these links with the link to the actual articles; --- hide all the sections below)</p>
-->

You can use text mode when building filters to expand on the fields and objects you can filter by.

For examples of the most common reasons for using text mode in a filter, see the following articles:

* [Filter: create multiple filter rules that reference the same field ("AND" statements)](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-refrence-the-same-field-multiple-times.md) 
* [Filter: display only items in an approval status](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-for-items-in-approval-status.md) 
* [Filter: display items by same-name statuses when the statuses are associated with different groups](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/filter-same-name-statuses-from-different-groups.md)

<p>In the standard mode interface, when attempting to create multiple filters that reference the same field (using the AND qualifier), one of the filters is deleted when you save the report and exit the report builder.<br>For example, Workfront does not allow you to save the following filter rules using the standard mode interface:<br>Task Name > Contains > Green<br>Task Name > Does Not Contain > Red<br>However, you can create these filters using text mode:</p>
<pre>name=green<br>name_Mod=cicontains<br>AND:1:name=red<br>AND:1:name_Mod=cinotcontains</pre>
<p><strong>Filter for items in an approval status</strong></p>

<p>To display only items in a certain status which is currently in Pending Approval:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Go to the filter you want to customize for a list of projects, for example.<br>This works the same for any other object with an approval status.</li>
<li value="2">Add a<strong>Filter Rule</strong> for the <strong>Status</strong> field of the object of your list.<br>For example, in a project report, add <strong>Status Equal Planning</strong>, if you want to display only projects which are in a status of <strong>Planning - Pending Approval</strong>.</li>
<li value="3">Click <strong>Switch to Text Mode</strong>.</li>
<li value="4">Modify the <em>status</em> line by adding a <strong>:A</strong> to the three letter key of the status:<br><pre>status=PLN:A<br>status_Mod=in</pre></li>
<li value="5">Click <strong>Save Filter</strong>.<br>You can use the same steps to filter for all statuses of all objects that could be associated with an approval process.</li>
</ol>

<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: link to this article: /Content/Reports and Dashboards/Reports/Custom View Filter Grouping Samples/filter-same-name-statuses-from-different-groups.htm) </p>
<p>You can have a task status assigned to Group A named <em>New Status</em> with the three-letter key <em>NST</em>. You may have another task status assigned to Group B also named <em>New Status</em> with the three-letter key <em>NES.</em> Although the names for the two statuses can be identical, the three letter code is always unique.<br>For more information about group statuses, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/create-or-edit-a-group-status.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or edit a group status</a>.<br>To distinguish between the two statuses in our example you can modify the text mode of the filter applied to a task list to ensure items in both statuses are identified:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Go to the filter you want to customize for a list of tasks, for example.<br>This works the same for projects and issues, as well.</li>
<li value="2">Add a<strong>Filter Rule</strong> for the <strong>Status</strong> field of the object of your list.<br>For example, in a task report, add <strong>Status Equal New Status</strong>, if you want to display only tasks which are in a status of <strong>New Status</strong>.<br>Notice that you have only one option for a status named New Status.</li>
<li value="3">Click <strong>Switch to Text Mode</strong>.<br>The following code should display:<br><pre xml:space="preserve">status=NST<br>status_Mod=in </pre><note type="note">
Only one status displays here. The status line displays one of the three-letter keys for one of the statuses.
</note></li>
<li value="4">Add the following two lines of code to add the status that is missing from the filter:<br><pre>status=NST<br>status_Mod=in<br>OR:1:status=NES<br>OR:1:status_Mod=in</pre></li>
<li value="5">Click <strong>Save Filter</strong>.</li>

<p>For example, you can display only tasks where the Actual Completion Date of the task is greater than the Planned Completion Date:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Go to the filter you want to customize on a task list, for example.</li>
<li value="2">Click <strong>Add Filter Rule</strong> for the <strong>Actual Completion Date</strong> field.</li>
<li value="3">Click <strong>Switch to Text Mode</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Create complex Text Mode filters that span multiple levels in the object hierarchy</strong></p>
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: Alina - links in this section and the following one are correct.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using EXISTS statements in the text mode interface, you can filter for objects that are removed from the filter object by more than two levels of hierarchy.</p>
<p>For information about filtering across multiple levels of object hierarchy, see the section <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md#examples" class="MCXref xref">Examples of text mode filters that span multiple levels in the object hierarchy</a> in the article <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md" class="MCXref xref">Create complex Text Mode filters using EXISTS statements</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Create complex Text Mode filters for missing objects</strong></p>
<p>Using EXISTS statements in the text mode interface, you can filter for objects that are missing. For example, you can display a list of users who did not log time in Workfront within a certain period of time or a list of custom fields that are not associated with any custom forms.</p>
<p>For information about filtering for missing objects, see the section <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md#missing-object-filters" class="MCXref xref">Create complex text mode filters for missing objects</a> in the article <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/create-complex-text-mode-filters-using-exists-statements.md" class="MCXref xref">Create complex Text Mode filters using EXISTS statements</a>.</p>

## Use Text Mode in groupings {#use-text-mode-in-groupings}

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: replace all these links with the link to the actual articles; --- hide all the sections below)</p>

You can use text mode when building groupings to expand on the fields and objects you can group by in lists and reports.

For examples of the most common reasons for using text mode in a grouping, see the following articles:

* [Grouping: organize list results by a calculated value common to all objects in the grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-by-calculated-common-values.md) 
* [Grouping: add a fourth grouping to a list](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-add-fourth-grouping.md) 
* [Grouping: edit the display name in a grouping](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-rename-grouping.md) 
* [Grouping: indicate whether the results of a grouping should be collapsed or expanded using text mode](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-collapsed-or-expanded-results.md)

<p>For example, you might want to view your tasks grouped by Percent Complete in ranges of 0-25, 26-50, 51-75, 75-99, and 100. Doing so would require using text mode for your grouping.<br>The grouping that you want to use for this example is:</p> 
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE:&nbsp;Alina: this should wrap within the page margins)</p>
<pre>textmode=true<br>group.0.valueexpression=IF({percentComplete}>=0&&{percentComplete}<=25,'0-25%',IF({percentComplete}>25&&{percentComplete}<=50,'26-50%',IF({percentComplete}>50&&{percentComplete}<=75,'51-75%',IF({percentComplete}>75&&{percentComplete}<=100,'76-100%',''))))<br>group.0.linkedname=direct<br>group.0.valueformat=doubleAsString<br>group.0.namekey=percentComplete</pre>

<p>You can rename groupings to something more familiar to your users. To do that, you can do one of the following in a grouping:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">When customizing a grouping, click <strong>Switch to Text Mode</strong>.</li>
<li value="2">Remove all the lines in the text mode interface of the grouping that have the word "name" in them, then add the line: <pre>group.0.name=Your Value</pre> You can also leave the <code>group.0.name</code> line blank, in which case the grouping shows the name of the value you are grouping by.<br>Or</li>
<li value="3">Add the following line to the existing text mode code in a Grouping:<br><pre>group.0.displayname=Your Value</pre>
