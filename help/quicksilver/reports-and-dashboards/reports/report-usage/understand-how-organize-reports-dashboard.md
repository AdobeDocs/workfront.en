# Understand how&nbsp;to organize reports on a dashboard

## Access dashboard information in a report list

You can see whether a report is added to a dashboard in Adobe Workfront. This might be useful when deciding which reports you can keep and which can be deleted from the system. If reports are on dashboards, users might still be relying on them. We recommend not deleting reports that are listed on dashboards that users are using.  
For more information about adding reports to dashboards, see the article [Add a report to a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/add-report-dashboard.md).

You can see whether a report is added to a dashboard by doing one of the following:

* Building a view for a list of reports and including dashboard information in the columns
* Filtering a list of reports by one or several specific dashboards that you know are being actively used
* Building a report for the report object and using a view or a filter which include dashboard information

Anyone can build a view or a filter, but you must have Edit access to Reports in your access level to build a report.  
For more information about access to reports, see the article [Grant access to reports, dashboards, and calendars](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-reports-dashboards-calendars.md).  
For more information about building a report, see the article [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">

 <tbody> 
  <tr>

   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars</p> <p>Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to a report</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td>
