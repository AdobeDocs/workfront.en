# Use sharable report folders

<!-- This article is linked in the UI -->

Use sharable report folders to organize reports and share those folders with other users. This feature is designed for teams that manage large volumes of reports and need scalable, consistent access control.

## Access requirements

You must be a system administrator to create top-level sharable report folders. Other users can access folders only when permissions are granted.

## Understand folder permissions

Sharable report folders use two permission levels:

* **View**: Users can open reports in the folder. Optionally allow resharing.
* **Manage**: Users can edit folder details, add or remove items, and share the folder.

Additional behavior:

* System administrators can see all folders.
* Other users see only folders they have access to.
* Permissions granted to a parent folder apply to all subfolders and reports within that folder tree.
* Users with access to a subfolder can see its parent folders for navigation, but not sibling folders unless access is granted.

## Create a sharable report folder

1. Go to **Main Menu** > **Reports**.
1. Turn on the **Sharable report folders** toggle.
1. Click **Create folder**.
1. (Optional) Add a description and choose a location for the folder.
1. Click **Create**.

## Share a report folder with other users

1. Go to **Main Menu** > **Reports**.
1. Open the folder you want to share.
1. Click **More** (three dots) > **Share**.
1. Add users, teams, or groups.
1. Choose **View** or **Manage** access. (Optional) Allow resharing for **View**.
1. Click **Save**.

## Move a report to a sharable folder

To move a report into a folder, you must have **Manage** rights to both the report and the target folder.

1. Go to **Main Menu** > **Reports**.
1. Select the report you want to move.
1. Click **More** (three dots) > **Move**.
1. Select the destination folder, then click **Move**.
