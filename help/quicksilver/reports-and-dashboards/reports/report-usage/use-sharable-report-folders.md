# Use sharable report folders

<!-- This article is linked in the UI -->

The new feature allows creation of folders that can be shared with other users, addressing scalability and usability issues with legacy folders, especially for customers managing large volumes of reports.

## Access requirements

## Understand folder permissions

Only system administrators can create top-level folders. 

System administrators can see all folders; other users only see folders they have been granted access to.

Permissions can be set to "view" (with optional reshare) or "manage" (with ability to manage/share), and can be removed as needed.

Granting permissions at a parent folder level cascades access to all subfolders and reports within that directory tree.

## Create a sharable report folder

go to main  menu > reports
enable sharable reports toggle on
click create folder button to create parent level folder
click more menu > 

## Share a report folder with other users

## Move a report to a folder

To move a report into a folder, the user must have "manage" rights to both the report and the target folder. 

Users with access to a subfolder are also given visibility to its parent folders for navigation, but not to sibling folders unless explicitly granted.
