# Workfront data lake overview

The Workfront data lake delivers unprecedented access to Workfront data using Snowflake technology, allowing you to answer business-critical questions and measure the value of your processes. This capability allows enterprise customers to interrogate their data using data visualization tools directly from a Workfront data lake, or to export Workfront data to a customer-owned data warehouses.

Subscribers will be able to connect their business intelligence tool of choice (Tableau, Power BI, Domo, Looker, etc.) to the Workfront data lake to create data visualizations with the following types of data:

* Low latency, current state data
* Change event records for point-in-time comparisons
* Daily historic snapshots for trend analysis
