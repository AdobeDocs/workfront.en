# Event Subscription API

<!--BOB clean this up-->

<!--
{{highlighted-preview}}
-->

When an action occurs on a Adobe Workfront object that is supported by event subscriptions, you can configure Workfront to send a response to your desired endpoint. This means that third-party applications can receive updates from Workfront interactions via the Workfront API soon after they occur. In general, you can expect to receive webhook notifications in less than 5 seconds from the data change being logged. On average, customers receive webhook notifications in less than 1 second from the data change being logged.  

In order to receive event subscriptions payloads through your firewall, you must add the following IP addresses to your allowlist:

**For customers in Europe:**

* 52.30.133.50
* 52.208.159.124 
* 54.220.93.204 
* 52.17.130.201 
* 34.254.76.122
* 34.252.250.191 

**For customers in locations other than Europe:**

* 54.244.142.219
* 44.241.82.96
* 52.36.154.34 
* 34.211.224.9 
* 54.218.48.56
* 52.39.217.230

The following topics support the Event Subscription API:

## Objects supported by event subscriptions

The following Workfront objects are supported by event subscriptions.

* Assignment
* Company
* Dashboard
* Document
* Expense
* Field
* Hour
* Issue
* Note
* Portfolio
* Program
* Project
* Record
* Record Type
* Report
* Task
* Template
* Timesheet
* User
* Workspace

For a list of fields supported by event subscription objects, see [Event subscription resource fields](../../wf-api/api/event-sub-resource-fields.md).

## Event subscription authentication

To create, query, or delete an event subscription, your Workfront user needs the following:

* An access level of "System Administrator" is required to use Event Subscriptions.
* A `sessionID`  header is required to use the Event Subscriptions API

   For more information, see [Authentication](api-basics.md#authentication) in [API Basics](api-basics.md).

## Forming the subscription resource

The subscription resource contains the following fields.

* objId (optional)

  * **String** - The ID of the object of the specified objCode for which events are fired. If this field is not specified, the user receives events for all objects of the specified type.

* objCode (required)

  * **String** - The objCode of the object being subscribed to changes. The possible values for objCode are listed in the table below.

* eventType (required)

   * **String** - A value that represents the type of event to which the object is subscribed. The available event types include:

      * CREATE
      * DELETE 
      * UPDATE

* url (required)

   * **String** - The URL of the endpoint to which subscription event payloads are sent via HTTP.

* authToken (required)

   * **String** - The OAuth2 bearer token used to authenticate with the URL specified in the "URL" field. 

## Creating event subscription API requests

After ensuring the user has administrator access and forming the subscription resource, you are ready to create event subscriptions.

Use the following syntax to construct the URL.

**Request URL** 


```
POST https://<HOSTNAME>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions
```

**Request headers** 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th> <p>Header Name</p> </th> 
   <th> <p>Header Value</p> </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <p>Content-type</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>application/json</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <p>sessionID</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>sessionID value</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

**Request Body Example:** 

<!-- [Copy](javascript:void(0);) --> 

```
{
                "objCode": "PROJ",
                "eventType": "UPDATE",
                "url": "http://requestb.in/ua5hi2ua",
                "authToken": "EauthTokenWorkfrontRocks1234_"
            }
```

**Response body example**

```
{
    "id": <NEW SUBSCRIPTION ID>,
    "version": <NEW SUBSCRIPTION VERSION>
}
```

| Response Code |Description |
|---|---|
| 201 (Created) |The event subscription was successfully created. |
| 400 (Bad Request) |The URL field of the subscription resource was deemed invalid. |
| 401 (Unauthorized) |The sessionID provided was empty or deemed invalid. |
| 403 (Forbidden) |The user that matches the provided sessionID does not have administrator access. |

Passing a subscription resource as the body of a request (with the content-type being "application/json") results in an event subscription being created for the object specified. A response code of 201 (Created) indicates the subscription was created. A response code other than 201 means the subscription was **NOT** created.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The "Location" response header contains the URI of the newly created event subscription.

**Response Headers Example:** 

| Response Headers |Example |
|---|---|
| Content-Length |`→0` |
| Date |`→Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:23:33 GMT` |

## Querying Event Subscriptions

When querying Workfront's HTTP use the GET method. There are two ways to query for event subscriptions: Query by subscription ID (see below) or query all event subscriptions.

### Query All Events Subscriptions

You can query all events subscriptions for a customer, or use the following to manage the response. You can also use the following options to manage the response:

* **page**: query parameter option to specify the number of pages to return. The default is 1.
* **limit**: query parameter option to specify the number of results to return per page. The default is 100 with a max of 1000.

The request syntax for listing all event subscriptions for a specific customer is as follows:

**Request URL** 

<!-- [Copy](javascript:void(0);) --> 

```
GET https://<HOSTNAME>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions
```

**Request Headers:** 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th> <p>Header Name</p> </th> 
   <th> <p>Header Value</p> </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <p>sessionID</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>sessionID value</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

**Response Codes** 

| Response Code |Description |
|---|---|
| 200 (OK)  |The request returned with all event subscriptions found for the customer matching the provided sessionID. |
| 401 (Unauthorized) |The sessionID provided was empty. |
| 403 (Forbidden) |The user, which matches the provided sessionID, does not have administrator access. |


**Response Headers Example**

* **page** and **limit** are the values provided in the request or the default if no values are provided
* **page_count** is the total number of pages that can be queried.
* **total_count** is the total number of subscriptions that match the query.

### Query By the Event Subscription ID

You can query for event subscriptions by the event subscription's ID. The request syntax for listing event subscriptions is as follows:

**Request URL** 

<!-- [Copy](javascript:void(0);) --> 

```
GET https://<HOSTNAME>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>
```

 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <p>sessionID</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>sessionID value</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

**Response Codes** 

| Response Code |Description |
|---|---|
| 200 (OK) |The request returned with the event subscription matching the provided subscription ID.  |

        "frozen_at": null
   }
}
```


## Event subscription versioning

Workfront has two versions of event subscriptions. 

The ability to upgrade or downgrade event subscriptions ensures that when changes are made to the structure of events, existing subscriptions do not break, allowing you to test and upgrade to the new version without a gap in your event subscription.

For more information on event subscription versioning, including specific differences between the version and important dates, see [Event subscription versioning](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/general/event-subs-versioning.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you upgrade or downgrade your event subscription to another version, you receive duplicate events for every event delivery for a five minute window after the version change. The duplicates include one each of event subscription version 1 and version 2. This ensures that you do not miss any events due to changing the event subscription version.

### Single subscription version change

The request syntax for changing the version for a single subscription is:

**Request URL**

```
PUT https://<HOSTNAME>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/version 
```

**Example request body**

```
{
    "version": "v2" 
}
```


**Example response body (200)**

```
{
    "id": <SUBSCRIPTION ID>,
    "version": "v2" 
}
```

**Possible response codes**

* 200
* 400
* 404


### Multiple subscription version change

This endpoint changes the version of multiple subscriptions, by list of subscriptions or all customer's subscriptions flag.

The request syntax for changing the version for a single subscription is:

**Request URL**

```
PUT https://<HOSTNAME>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions/version
```

**Example request bodies**

* Request body for list of subscriptions

   ```
   {
       "subscriptionIds": [<SUBSCRIPTION ID 1>, <SUBSCRIPTION ID 2>],
       "version": "v2" 
   }
   ```

* Request Body for all customer's subscriptions

   ```
   {
       "allCustomerSubscriptions": true,
       "version": "v2" 
   }
   ```

**Example response body (200)**

```
{
    "subscription_ids": [<SUBSCRIPTION ID 1>, <SUBSCRIPTION ID 2>, ...],
    "version": "v2" 
}
```

**Possible response codes**

* 200
* 400

## Event subscription filtering

Event subscription filtering can be used to ensure that you receive only relevant messages. Creating filters for your subscriptions may significantly decrease the number of messages that your endpoint needs to consume.

For example, an **UPDATE - TASK** event subscription can be set to trigger only when the **newState** of an event payload defines the **taskStatus** as **current**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The following attributes apply to event subscription filtering

* When a filter field has a non-empty value only messages with a **newState** containing the filter keys and values are sent to the subscribed URL
* You may filter by custom data included in the **newState** AND/OR **oldState**of the object
* Filters are evaluated solely on whether or not they are equal to a specific value
* If your filter syntax is incorrect or does not match any data contained in the **newState** of the payload, a validation message will not be returned to indicate an error has occured
* Filters can't be updated on a subscription that currently exists; a new subscription must be created with new filter parameters.
* Multiple filters can be applied to a single subscription and the subscription will only be delivered when all filter conditions have been met.
* Applying multiple filters to a single subscription is a practice equivalent to using an **AND** logical operator.
* Multiple event subscriptions can be applied to a single object as long as one or more event subscription field parameters are different between each event subscription.
* When multiple event subscriptions are assigned to a single object, all event subscriptions associated with that object can be returned to a single endpoint. This practice can be used used as an equivalent substitute for logical operator **OR** which can't be set using filter parameters.
* The following fields are not filterable:

    * DOCU.groups
    * RECORD.data
    * RECORD_TYPE.data
    * RECORD_TYPE.fields

### Using comparison operators

You can specify a comparison field along with the filter field. Use a comparison operator in this to field to filter for comparative results. For example, you can can create an UPDATE - TASK subscription that only sends a payload if the task status does NOT equal current. You can use the following comparison operators:

#### eq: equal

This filter allows messages to come through if the change that occurred matches `fieldValue` in the filter exactly. The `fieldValue` value is case-sensitive.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "name",
            "fieldValue": "again",
            "comparison": "eq"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### ne: not equal

This filter allows messages to come through if the change that occurred does not match `fieldValue` in the filter exactly. The `fieldValue` value is case-sensitive.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "name",
            "fieldValue": "again",
            "comparison": "ne"
        }
    ]
}

```

#### gt: greater than

This filter allows messages to come through if the update on the specified `fieldName` is greater than the value for `fieldValue`.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [

            "fieldName": "plannedCompletionDate",
            "fieldValue": "2022-12-11T16:00:00.000-0800",
            "comparison": "gt"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### gte: greater than or equal to

This filter allows messages to come through if the update on the specified `fieldName` is greater than or equal to the value for `fieldValue`.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",

            "fieldValue": "2022-12-11T16:00:00.000-0800",
            "comparison": "gte"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### lt: less than

This filter allows messages to come through if the update on the specified `fieldName` is less than the value for `fieldValue`.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "plannedCompletionDate",
            "fieldValue": "2022-12-18T16:00:00.000-0800",
            "comparison": "lt"
        }
    ]
}

```

#### lte: less than or equal to

This filter allows messages to come through if the update on the specified `fieldName` is less than or equal to the value for `fieldValue`.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "plannedCompletionDate",
            "fieldValue": "2022-12-18T16:00:00.000-0800",
            "comparison": "lte"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### contains

This filter allows messages to come through if the change that occurred contains the `fieldValue` in the filter. The `fieldValue` value is case-sensitive

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "name",
            "fieldValue": "again",
            "comparison": "contains"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### change

This filter allows messages to come through only if the specified field (`fieldName`) has a different value in oldstate and newstate. Updating other fields besides the one specified (`fieldName`) will not return that change. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>`fieldValue` in the filters array below has no effect.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "name",
            "fieldValue": "",
            "comparison": "changed"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### state

This connector makes the filter apply to the new state or old state of the object that was created or updated. This is helpful when you want to know where a change was made from something to another.
`oldState` is not possible on CREATE `eventTypes`.

>[!NOTE]

>The subscription below with the given filter will only return messages where the name of the task contains `again` on the `oldState`, what it was before an update was made on the task.
>A use case for this would be to find the objCode messages that changed from one thing to another. For example, to find out all of the tasks that changed from "Research Some name" to "Research TeamName Some name"

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "name",
            "fieldValue": "again",
            "comparison": "contains",
            "state": "oldState"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Using nested filters

Event Subscription supports filtering on nested fields of events by using the nested field names. For example, to filter a message where `newState.data.customField1 = 'myCustomeFieldValue'`, the following subscription with filter can be created:

```

{
    "objCode": "RECORD",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedRecords",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "data",
            "fieldValue": {
                    "customField1": "myCustomFieldValue"
            },
            "comparison": "eq",
            "state": "newState"
        }
    ]
}

```

Doubly nested filters can be addressed as well.

```

"filters": [
    {
        "fieldName": "data",
        "fieldValue": {
            "fields": {
                "children": {
                    "customerId":"customer1234",
                    "name":"New Campaign"
                }
            }
        },
        "comparison": "eq",
        "state": "newState"
    }
],
"filterConnector": 'AND'

```

### Using connector fields

The `filterConnector` field on the subscription payload allows you to choose how the filters should be applied. The default is "AND", where the filters must all be `true` for the subscription message to come through. If "OR" is specified then only one filter must match for the subscription message to come through.

```
{
    "objCode": "TASK",
    "eventType": "UPDATE",
    "authToken": "token",
    "url": "https://domain-for-subscription.com/API/endpoint/UpdatedTasks",
    "filters": [
        {
            "fieldName": "name",
            "fieldValue": "again",
            "comparison": "contains"
        },
        {
            "fieldName": "name",
            "fieldValue": "also",
            "comparison": "contains"
        }
    ],
    "filterConnector": "AND"
}
```

## Deleting Event Subscriptions

When deleting Workfront's HTTP use the DELETE method. The request syntax for deleting a single event subscription by subscription ID is as follows:

**Request URL:** 

<!-- [Copy](javascript:void(0);) --> 

```
DELETE https://<HOSTNAME>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>
```

## Examples of Event Payloads

The payload that a user receives varies depending on the object type, but there is a consistent format for which those varying payloads are delivered.

For example, the following properties remain consistent across all event payloads:

* eventType
* subscriptionId
* oldState
* newState
* eventTime

Although consistent in format, the values contained within the properties vary between different objects and object types.

Samples of payloads for an UPDATE event and a CREATE event are shown below. Notice in the UPDATE example the oldState and newState objects are the same, while in the CREATE example the oldState object is empty (not NULL).

The following is an example payload for an UPDATE event:

<!-- [Copy](javascript:void(0);) --> 

```

## Base 64 Encoding

If an event subscription is being rejected because of a conflict between special characters contained in your event subscriptions and your network settings, then you can use Base64 encoding to pass your event subscriptions. Base64 is a set of encoding schemes that can translate any arbitrary data into an ASCII string format. It is important to note that Base64 is not a form of security encryption.

### Base 64 Encoding Field

The base64Encoding field is an optional field that is used to enable Base64 encoding of event subscription payloads. The default value is false and the possible values are: true, false, and " " (blank).

### Example of a request using the base64Encoding field

If a request is made using the base64Encoding field set to true, then the **newState** and **oldState** objects in the payload are delivered as base 64 encoding strings. If the base64Encoding field is set to false, left blank, or not included in the request, then the returned payload will not be encoded in base 64.

The following is an example of a request that uses the base64Encoding field:

<!-- [Copy](javascript:void(0);) --> 

```
{
                "objCode": "PROJ",
                "eventType": "UPDATE",
                "url": "http://requestb.in/ua5hi2ua"",
                "authToken": "EauthTokenWorkfrontRocks1234_",
                "base64Encoding": "true"
            }
```

## Deprecated Method for Querying All Event Subscriptions

The following API endpoint is deprecated and should not be used for new implementations. We also recommend transitioning old implementations to the method in the **Querying Event Subscriptions** section described above.

You can query all event subscriptions for a customer as specified by the sessionID value. The request syntax for listing all event subscriptions for a specific customer is the following URL:

<!-- [Copy](javascript:void(0);) --> 

```
GET https://<HOSTNAME>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions/list
```
