# Using the API Explorer

When using the Adobe Workfront Core API, the API Explorer is a legacy reference tool that catalogs the relationships between supported resources, parameters, and variables.

## Access the API Explorer:

1. Use a web browser to navigate to the [API Explorer](https://one.workfront.com/s/api-explorer)

1. The **Filter** field, can be used to filter the objects listed by name and will truncate the list of objects displayed accordingly:

   * **Fields**: Available fields within the specified object.
   * **References**: Available reference variables for the specified object. A reference is an alias for a variable. Once initialized, a reference can be used interchangeably with the variable name. A reference uses initialized memory.
   * **Collections**: Available collections for the object. Collections are variables that represent a one-to-many relationship between the object and the resource.
   * **Search**: Available search resources for the object. The results of a search are based on the query parameters specified by the search resource in the API request.
   * **Actions**: Supported actions for the object. Actions can be simple or complex procedures that execute against a resource or set of resources. A given action may also affect related resources.

1. Open a tab, then click the Object ID to view applicable variables.

   |---|---|
   | Field Name |The name of a field used in an operation within the Workfront API. |
   | Field Type |The kind of values that can be entered into a specific field in a data table. Possible field type values include string, double, int, dateTime. |
