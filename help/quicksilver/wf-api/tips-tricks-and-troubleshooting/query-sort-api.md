# Sorting query results in the API

You can sort your results by any field if you append the following to your API call:

```
&entryDate_Sort=asc
```

For example, if you want to sort by task Planned Completition Date, remove `entryDate` and replace it with `plannedCompletionDate`.

```
&plannedCompletionDate_Sort=asc
```

This works for most fields in Adobe Workfront.
