# Document Webhooks Error Handling

Problems can arise when processing API requests. This should be handled in a consistent way across all API endpoints. When an error occurs, the webhook provider should innclude an error code in the response header. Error codes include:

* 403 - Forbidden. Indicates that either the request tokens are missing or invalid, or that credentials associated with the tokens don't have access to the specified resource. For OAuth-based webhook providers, Adobe Workfront will attempt to retrieve new access tokens.

* 404 - Not found. Indicates that the specified file or folder doesn't exist.

* 500 - Internal Server Error. Any other type of error.

* Description of the error in the response body using the following format:  
  
  ```
  {status: “error”
   error: “Sample error message”}
  ```
