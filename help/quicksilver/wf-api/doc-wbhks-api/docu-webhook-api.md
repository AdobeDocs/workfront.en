# Document Webhooks API

Adobe Workfront Document Webhooks defines a set of API endpoints through which Workfront makes authorized API calls to an External Document Provider. This allows anyone to create a middleware plugin for any document storage provider.

The user experience for webhook-based integrations will be similar to that of existing document integrations, such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox. For example, a Workfront user will be able to perform the following actions:

* Navigate the folder structure of the external document provider
* Search files
* Link files into Workfront
* Upload files to the external document provider
* View a thumbnail for the document

## Reference Implementation

To help jumpstart the development of a new webhooks implementation, Workfront provides a reference implementation. Code for this can be found at [https://github.com/Workfront/webhooks-app](https://github.com/Workfront/webhooks-app). This implementation is Java-based and allows Workfront to connect documents on a network file system.

## Registering a Webhook Integration

Workfront administrators can add a custom webhook integration for their company by navigating to Setup > Documents > Custom Integrations within Workfront. From the Custom Integration page within Setup,&nbsp;administrators can view a list of existing document Webhook integrations. From this page, integrations can be added, edited, enabled, and disabled. To add an integration, click the "Add Integration" button.

### Available Fields

When adding an integration, the administrator will enter values for the following fields:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Field Name</th> 
   <th>Description</th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Name</td> 
   <td>The name of this integration.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Base API URL</td> 
   <td> <p>The location of the callback API. When making calls to the external system,Workfront will simply append the endpoint name to this address. For example, if the admin entered the Base API URL, " https://www.mycompany.com/api/v1 ", Workfront would using the following URL to get a document's metadata: https://www.mycompany.com/api/v1/metadata?id=1234.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Request parameters</td> 
   <td> <p>Optional values to be appended to the querystring of every API call. For example, access_type=offline.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Authentication Type</td> 
   <td>OAuth2 or ApiKey</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Authentication URL</td> 
   <td> <p>(OAuth2 Only) The full URL used for user authentication. Workfront will&nbsp;navigate users to this address as part of the OAuth provisioning process. Note: Workfront will append a "state" parameter to the query string. The provider must pass this back to Workfront by appending it to the Workfront Redirect URI.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Token Endpoint URL</td> 
   <td> <p>(OAuth2 Only) The full API URL used to retrieve OAuth2 tokens. This is hosted by the webhook provider or external document provider</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Client ID</td> 
   <td>(OAuth2 Only) The OAuth2 Client ID for this integration</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Client Secret</td> 
   <td> <p>(OAuth2 Only) The OAuth2 Client Secret for this integration</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Workfront Redirect URI</td> 
   <td>&nbsp; <p>(OAuth2 Only) This is a read-only field and is generated by Workfront. This&nbsp;value is used to register this integration with the external document provider. Note: As described above for Authentication URL, the provider must append the "state" parameter and its value to the querystring when performing the redirect.</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>ApiKey</td> 
   <td>&nbsp; <p>(ApiKey Only) Used to make authorized API calls to the webhook provider. The API key issued by the webhook provider.</p></td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&nbsp;

## Authentication

Workfront document webhooks supports two different forms of authentication: OAuth2 and ApiKey. In both cases, Workfront passes authentication tokens in the header when making an API call.

### OAuth2

OAuth2 allows Workfront to make authorized API calls to a webhook provider on behalf of a user. Before doing so, the user must connect their external document provider account to Workfront and grant Workfront

access to act on their behalf. This handshaking process only happens once for each user. Here's how it works:

1. The user begins connecting the webhook integration to their account. Currently, this is done by&nbsp;clicking the "Add Document" dropdown > "Add Service" > Custom integration name. 
1. Workfront navigates the user the Authentication URL, which may prompt the user to login to the&nbsp;external document provider. This page is hosted by the webhook provider or the external document management system. When doing so Workfront adds a "state" parameter to the Authentication URL. This value must be passed back to Workfront by appending the same value to the Workfront Return URI in the step below. 
1. After logging to the external system (or if the user is already logged in), the user is taken to an&nbsp;"Authentication" page, which explains that Workfront is requesting access to perform a set of actions on the user's behalf. 
1. If the user clicks the "Allow" button, the browser will redirect to the Workfront Redirect URI , adding "code=`<code>`" to the querystring. Per the OAuth2 spec, this token is short lived. The querystring must also have the following, "state=`<sent_by_workfront>`". 
1. Workfront processes this request and makes an API call to the Token Endpoint URL with the&nbsp;authorization code. 
1. The Token Endpoint URL returns a refresh token and access token. 
1. Workfront stores a these tokens and fully provisions the webhook integration for this user. 
1. From this point forward, Workfront will be able to make authorized API calls to the webhook provider.&nbsp;When making these calls, Workfront will send the the access token in the HTTP request header as shown below:  

   ```
   -------------------------------  
   Authorization: Bearer [access_token] ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­  
   -------------------------------
   ```

1. If the access token has expired, Workfront will make a call to the Token Endpoint URL to retrieve a&nbsp;new access token then attempt the authorized API call again with the new access token.

### ApiKey

Making authorized API calls to a webhook provider using an ApiKey is much simpler than OAuth2. When making an API call, Workfront will simply pass the ApiKey and Workfront username in the HTTP request header:

```
-------------------------------

apiKey: 12345

username: johndoe@foo.com

-------------------------------
```

The Webhook provider can use the username to apply user-specific permissions. This works best when both systems connect to LDAP using Single Sign On (SSO).

### Adding Request Headers (optional)

In addition to using either OAuth2 tokens or an ApiKey for authentication, Workfront can send a predefined set of headers to the webhook provider for every API call. A Workfront administrator can setup set this up when&nbsp;registering or editing a Webook Integration, as described in the section above. See Registering a Webhook Integration.

For example, this can be used for Basic Authentication. To do this, the Workfront administrator would add the following Request Header information in the Custom Integration dialog:

&nbsp; &nbsp;Authorization Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==

where QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== is a base-64 encoded string of "username:password". See Basic Authentication . Provided that this added, Workfront will pass this in the HTTP request header, in addition to other request headers:

```
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------------------

apiKey: 12345

username: johndoe@foo.com

Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

-------------------------------
```

## API Specification

Below is a list of APIs that the webhook provider should implement in order for document webhooks to work.

### Getting OAuth2 Tokens (needed OAuth2 authentication only)

Returns the OAuth2 refresh token and access token for an authenticated user. This is invoked once when the the user provisions a Document Provider. Subsequent calls are made to get an updated access token.

HTTP Request POST /any/url

The URL is configurable and corresponds to the Token Endpoint URL value on the custom integration Setup page.

"mimeType":"image/png",
"dateModified":"2014­06­05T17:39:45.251Z",
"size":"32554694"
},
]
```

### Do a Search

Returns metadata for the files and folders returned from a search. This can be implemented as a full-text search or as a regular database query. Workfront calls the /search endpoint when the user performs a search from the external file browser.

**URL**

GET /search

**Query Parameters** 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Name&nbsp;</th> 
   <th>Description</th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>

   <td>query</td> 
   <td>The search term or phrase.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>parentId</td> 
   <td> <p>(optional) The folder ID from which the search executed. Note: This is a placeholder for a future feature in Workfront. Currently, workfront does not pass this parameter.&nbsp;</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  </tbody> 
</table>

The Document Webhooks API does not currently support pagination.

&nbsp;

**Response**

JSON containing a list of metadata for files and folders matching the query. What constitutes a "match" is determined by the webhook provider. Ideally, it should do a full-text search. Doing a filename-based search also works.

**Example:** `https://www.acme.com/api/search?query=test-query`

**Response**

```
[
{ File/Folder Metadata },
{ File/Folder Metadata }
]
```

### Get the content of a document

Returns the raw bytes for a document

**URL**

GET /download

   <th>Name&nbsp;</th> 
   <th>Description</th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody>

| Name&nbsp; |Description |
|---|---|
| id&nbsp; |The document ID. |
| size&nbsp; |&nbsp;The width of the thumbnail |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

&nbsp;

**Response**

The raw thumbnail bytes.

**Example:** `https://www.acme.com/api/thumbnail?id=123456`

### Upload a file - Part 1 of 2

Uploading a file to a document storage provider is a two-step process that requires two separate API endpoint. Workfront begins the upload process by calling /uploadInit . This endpoint returns a document ID which is then passed to /upload when uploading the document bytes. Depending on the underlying document storage system, it may be necessary to create a zero-length document then update the contents of the document later.

Added to version 1.1 of this spec, the document ID and document version ID can be used to retrieve extra information from Workfront. For example, if the document management system wants extra information about the document, the webhook implementation code could use the document ID to retrieve that information using Workfront's RESTful API. As a good practice, this information could come from custom data fields on the document and it's containing task, issue, or project.

**URL**

POST /uploadInit

**Query Parameters** 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Name&nbsp;</th> 
   <th>Description</th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>parentId&nbsp;</td> 
   <td>The parent folder ID, as referenced by the webhook provider.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>filename&nbsp;</td> 
   <td>The name of the document</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>documentId</td> 
   <td> <p>The Workfront document ID (added in version 1.1)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>documentVersionId&nbsp;</td> 
   <td>The Workfront document version ID (added in version 1.1)</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&nbsp;

**Response**

The metadata for the file, as defined by the /metadata endpoint.

**Example:** `https://www.acme.com/api/uploadInit?parentId=12345&filename=new-file.png&docu mentId=511ea6e000023edb38d2effb2f4e6e3b&documentVersionId=511ea6e000023edb38d2e ffb2f4e6e3b`

**Response**

### Perform a Custom Action

(Release Date - TBD) This endpoint will allow a Workfront user (or perhaps an automated workflow event) to perform an action in the external system. The /customAction endpoint accepts a "name" parameter, which allows the webhook provider to implement multiple custom operations.

The webhook provider registers custom actions with Workfront by including the actions in the /serviceInfo response under customActions. Workfront loads this list when setting up or refreshing the webhook provider under Setup > Documents > Custom Integrations.

response

```
{
"status": "success" 
}
```


## Error Handling

Problems may arise when processing API requests. This should handled in a consistent way across across all API endpoints. When an error occurs, the webhook provider do the following:

* Include an error code in the response header. Error codes include:

   * 403 - Forbidden. Indicates that either the request tokens are missing or invalid, or that credentials associated with the tokens don't have access to the specified resource. For OAuth-based webhook providers, Workfront will attempt to retrieve new access tokens.
   * 404 - Not found. Indicates that the specified file or folder doesn't exist.
   * 500 - Internal Server Error. Any other type of error.

* Describe the error in the response body using the following format:


```
{
"status": "error"
"error": "Sample error message" 
}
```


## Testing

To verify that your document webhook implementation works correctly, run the following tests. These are manual tests that go through the Workfront web interface and indirectly hit the endpoints for your webhook implementation.

### Prerequisites

To run these tests you will need the following:

* A Workfront account with Advanced Document Management (ADM) enabled
* A Workfront user for this account with System Admin rights
* A Document Webhook instance, who's HTTP endpoints are accessible to Workfront

These tests also assume that you've already registered your Document Webhook instance in Workfront under Setup > Documents > Custom Integrations.

### Test 10: Refresh access token (OAuth2 Webhook providers only)

Tests the following endpoints: Token Endpoint URL

1. Provision a the Document Webhook service for a user 
1. Invalidate the user's access token by either 1 )waiting for it to timeout, or 2) invalidating it manually in the external system.
1. Refresh the access token in Workfront. You can do this, for example, by linking a document into Workfront. You will know that the access token refreshed successfully if you were able to navigate to and link a document.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, the Send To... isn't available for linked documents. This will be added by Workfront. You can test the /download endpoint by hitting the endpoint manually using a REST client, such as Postman. Alternatively, the /download endpoint can be tested by generating a digital proof. To enable, digital proofing please contact Workfront.
