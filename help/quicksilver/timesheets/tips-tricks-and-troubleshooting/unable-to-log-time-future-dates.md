# Unable to Log Time for Future Dates

## Problem

You are unable to log hours for future dates on projects, tasks, or issues because the fields are disabled. 

The system administrator can determine whether you are able to log hours for future dates in timesheets. 

## Solution

Contact your Adobe Workfront administrator.

System administrators can update a setting  to allow you to log time for future dates. 

As a system administrator, do the following; 

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Setup** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1. Expand **Timesheets & Hours**, then click **Preferences**.

1. In the **General Preferences** section, select the **Log hours for future dates**. 

1. Click **Save**.

For more information about this and other options regarding timesheets and hours, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).
