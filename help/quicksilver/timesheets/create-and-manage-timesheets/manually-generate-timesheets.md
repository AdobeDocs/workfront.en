# Manually generate timesheets

To enable changes that you made to the timesheet profiles to reflect in current timesheets, you have to first delete the existing timesheets and then manually generate new ones. You can manually generate timesheets from the Timesheets area or the Diagnostics area in Setup, as explained in this article.

For instructions on deleting timesheets, see [Delete timesheets in Adobe Workfront](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/delete-timesheets.md).

## Considerations about manually generated timesheets

When you manually generate timesheets:

* They are generated according to the timesheet profiles that are associated with your users. Users who do not have timesheet profiles associated with them do not receive timesheets.
* Only the current timesheet and the one to follow are generated. Workfront does not generate two timesheets for the same period. If you already have a timesheet for the current timeframe, another one will not generate when you are using the manual process to generate timesheets.
