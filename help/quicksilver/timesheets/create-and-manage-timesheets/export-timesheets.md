# Export a list of timesheets

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

As a people manager or timesheet approver, you might need to download a list of timesheets to quickly view information about the timesheets of the people you are responsible for. You can do this by exporting a list of timesheets.

## Access requirements

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher to Tasks and Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level.
