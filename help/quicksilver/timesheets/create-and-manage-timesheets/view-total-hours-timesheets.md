# View total hours on the timesheet

You can view&nbsp;the total number of hours on&nbsp;your timesheet. The total number of timesheet hours includes hours logged for projects, tasks, issues, and all general hours.

The total hours reflect hours submitted through the timesheet, the Updates area, or in the Hours area for projects, tasks, or issues.

## View the total hours on your timesheet

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Timesheets**. The **All** filter is selected by default and it displays all the timesheets you have access to view.

   ![](assets/timesheet-list-one-timesheet-selected-nwe-350x70.png)

1. (Optional) Do one of the following to update the filter in the list of timesheets:

   * Select **My Timesheet Approvals** in the upper-right corner of the page to view only timesheets that you approve

     Or

     Select **My Timesheets** to view only your timesheets.

     This applies the My Timesheet Approvals or the My&nbsp;Timesheet filters to the list of timesheets.

   >[!NOTE]
