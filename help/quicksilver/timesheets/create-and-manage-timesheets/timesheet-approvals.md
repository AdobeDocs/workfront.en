# Approve a timesheet

The process of approving timesheets provides&nbsp;managers with visibility into the work hours of their direct reports. Approvers can verify that&nbsp;all time recorded has been allocated in the correct areas and that&nbsp;a sufficient number of hours have been recorded for the period.

Adobe Workfront provides the ability to configure timesheet approvals to support in this area.

For information on submitting a timesheet, see [Submit a timesheet for approval](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/submit-timesheet-for-approval.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Designate timesheet approvers

Typically, timesheets are approved by functional managers or human resources personnel. (Timesheets are not normally approved by project managers.)

A timesheet approver is defined when creating the Timesheet Profile.&nbsp;You must have a Plan license to be designated as an approver.

For more information about designating timesheet approvers, see the section [Create or edit a timesheet profile](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md#create) in the article [Create, edit, and assign timesheet profiles](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md).

## Approve a timesheet

You can approve any timesheets that have been submitted where you have been designated as an approver. When a timesheet is submitted for approval, the timesheet is listed in the **Approvals**&nbsp;area on your **Home** &nbsp;page. For more information, see [Approving work](../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approving-work.md).

If the Workfront administrator has&nbsp;enabled the Timesheet Approval to User and the Timesheet Rejection to User event handlers, you are notified after the timesheet is approved or rejected. For information about enabling event notifications, see [Event notifications available in Adobe Workfront](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/event-notifications-available-in-wf.md).

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront.
