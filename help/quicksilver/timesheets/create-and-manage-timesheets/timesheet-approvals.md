# Approve a timesheet

<!--Audited: 8/2024-->

The process of approving timesheets provides managers with visibility into the work hours of their direct reports. Approvers can verify that all time recorded has been allocated in the correct areas and that a sufficient number of hours have been recorded for the period.

Adobe Workfront provides the ability to configure timesheet approvals to support in this area.

For information on submitting a timesheet, see [Submit a timesheet for approval](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/submit-timesheet-for-approval.md).

## Designate timesheet approvers

Typically, timesheets are approved by functional managers or human resources personnel. Timesheets are not usually approved by project managers. Project managers may approve time logged on projects, but team or human resource managers should approve timesheets. 

A timesheet approver is defined when creating the Timesheet Profile. You must have a Plan license to be designated as an approver.

For more information about designating timesheet approvers, see the section [Create or edit a timesheet profile](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md#create) in the article [Create, edit, and assign timesheet profiles](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md).

## Approve a timesheet

You can approve any timesheets that have been submitted where you have been designated as an approver. When a timesheet is submitted for approval, the timesheet is listed in the **My Approvals** widget in your **Home** area. For more information, see [Approving work](../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approving-work.md).

If the following notification settings are in place, the user who submits the timesheet for approval receives an email after a timesheet is approved:

* The Workfront administrator has enabled the Timesheet Approval to User and the Timesheet Rejection to User event handlers. For information about enabling event notifications, see [Event notification types](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/event-notifications-available-in-wf.md).
* The My timesheet is approved personal notification is enabled on the user's profile page. For more information, see [Modify your own email notifications](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).
