# Groups vs. teams in Adobe Workfront

Groups and teams are collections of users in Adobe Workfront.

Although you can designate just one Home Group and one Home Team per user, each user can belong to an unlimited number of teams or groups. However, to avoid confusion, we recommend that each user belong to a limited number of teams and groups.

The following sections describe recommendations for when to use groups or teams, as well as a detailed functionality comparison.

## Use groups to represent the departmental structure

We recommend that you configure groups to match your departmental structure.

For example, you might have a Finance group that contains users in the Finance Department. Within the Finance Department, people might be structured in teams which work independently from one another.

For more information about creating and managing groups, see [Create a group](../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/create-a-group.md) and [Manage a group](../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/manage-a-group.md).

## Use Teams to represent the working structure within a department

We recommend that you configure Teams to match the day-to-day working structure of your departmental teams.

For example, you might have a Payroll Team, an Accounts Payable, and an Accounts Receivable team. Typically, people in each of these teams work on projects, tasks, or issues that are similar for those teams.

For more information about creating and managing teams, see [Create and manage teams](../../people-teams-and-groups/create-and-manage-teams/create-and-mange-teams.md).
