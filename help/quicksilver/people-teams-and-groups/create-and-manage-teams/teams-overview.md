# Teams overview

<!-- Audited: 01/2024 -->

The purpose of a team in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] is to capture the real-life dynamic of functional working groups in the workplace.

For information about how when to use teams instead of groups, see [Groups vs. teams in [!DNL Adobe Workfront]](../../people-teams-and-groups/work-with-groups-and-teams/understanding-differences-and-similarities-between-groups-and-teams.md).

## Team organization

A [!DNL Workfront Team] differs from a project team. [!DNL Workfront] teams include individuals of diverse job roles or various purposes, who are functionally affiliated and organized into a working unit. An individual can belong to more than one team. Team members might match org chart relationships, but they can also appear outside the department structure.

## Team creation

Teams are typically created by a [!DNL Workfront] administrator, but a user with appropriate access can create teams as well. Once a team is created, the Project Manager can assign an entire team to a task instead of deciding on an individual or job role. For more information, see [Create a team](/help/quicksilver/people-teams-and-groups/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team.md).

## Team assignments

A Project Manager does not always know which individual will complete an assignment--simply that a particular work unit or team completes work of that specific nature.

Members of an assigned team can also go to the [!UICONTROL Teams] > [!UICONTROL Team] Requests area and see the tasks assigned to their team. They can assess the impact of a task and volunteer to work on it. For more information, see [Team requests overview](/help/quicksilver/people-teams-and-groups/work-with-team-requests/team-requests-overview.md).
