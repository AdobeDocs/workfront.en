# Teams overview

The purpose of a team in Adobe Workfront is to capture the real-life dynamic of functional working groups in the workplace.

For information about how when to use teams instead of groups, see [Groups vs. teams in Adobe Workfront](../../people-teams-and-groups/work-with-groups-and-teams/understanding-differences-and-similarities-between-groups-and-teams.md).

## Team organization

A Workfront Team differs from a project team. Workfront teams include individuals of diverse job roles or various purposes, who are functionally affiliated and organized into a working unit. An individual can belong to more than one team. Team members might match org chart relationships, but they can also appear outside the department structure.

## Team creation

Teams are typically created by a Workfront administrator, but a user with appropriate access can create teams as well.&nbsp;Once a team is created, the Project Manager can assign an entire team to a task instead of deciding on an individual or job role.

## Team assignments

A Project Manager does not always know which individual will complete an assignment-simply that a particular work unit or team&nbsp;completes work of that specific nature.

Members of an assigned team can also go to the Teams > Team Requests area and see the tasks assigned to their team. They can assess the impact of a task and volunteer to work on it.
