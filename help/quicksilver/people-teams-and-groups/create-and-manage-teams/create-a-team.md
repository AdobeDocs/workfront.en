# Create a team

When you create a team you become the Team Owner, by default.

You can view Team Owners for all the teams when you create a report for Teams and include the [!UICONTROL Owner Name] field in your report. (For more information about creating a report, see [Create a custom report](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).)

For information on how an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator can create a team from the [!UICONTROL Setup] area, see [Create a team from the [!UICONTROL Setup] area](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team-from-setup.md).

## Create a team

{{step1-to-team}}

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Switch Teams]** icon ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png), then click **[!UICONTROL Create New Team]**.

   ![Select Create new team.](assets/create-new-team.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL New Team]** box that displays, enter the following information:

   * **[!UICONTROL Team Name]:** Type a name for the new team.
   * **[!UICONTROL Group]**: If you want to assign the team to an associated group, start typing the name of the group, then select the name when it appears.

     You can make sure you are associating the right group with the team by hovering over it and clicking the information icon ![](assets/info-icon.png) that displays next to it. This displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and its administrators.

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >When a team is assigned to a group or subgroup, any group administrators of that group or subgroup can manage the team without being a member of it. Group administrators can go to the Teams area from the Main Menu and click the Switch Teams arrow ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png) to list all of the teams that are assigned to the groups that they manage.

   * **[!UICONTROL This is an Agile Team]:** Select this option if you want to configure this new team to be an agile team.

     For more information about agile teams, see [Create an agile team](../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/create-an-agile-team.md).
   
   * **[!UICONTROL Team Members]:** Begin typing the name of a user to add to the team, then select the name when it appears in the drop-down list.

     Repeat this process to add multiple users to the team.

     There is no limit for how many users you can add to a team. However, we recommend to not have an excessively high number of users in one team, as your work management might become too complex for these teams.
   
   * **[!UICONTROL Description]:** Type a description for the team.

     The description displays on the top right of the Teams area when the team is selected.
     
     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >If the description is long, you can click it to display the full description in a pop-up. If you have access to edit the team settings, you can also edit the description directly in the pop-up.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.
