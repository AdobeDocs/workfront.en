# Edit team settings

As an Adobe Workfront administrator or a user with a Plan or Work license, you can edit Team Settings.

You can add users to a team, set the team layout template, and set how status is recorded when work items are completed by a team.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront plan*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><strong>Adobe Workfront license*</strong></td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Edit team settings

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click **Teams**.

1. Click the **Switch team** icon ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png), then either select a new team from the drop-down menu or search for a team in the search bar.

1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-icon.png), then select **Edit**.

   Only team members with either a Plan or Work license see this option. 
    
   If you should have the Edit option but you do not see it, ask your Workfront administrator to verify that Team Settings is visible in the layout template for Scrum Team, Kanban Team, or Waterfall Team.

1. In team settings, you can make the following kinds of changes:

   * Modify the team name
   * Deactivate the team
   * Associate the team with a group

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >When a team is assigned to a group or subgroup, any group administrators of that group or subgroup can manage the team without being a member of it. Group administrators can go to the Teams area from the Main Menu and click the Switch Teams arrow ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png) to list all of the teams that are assigned to the groups that they manage.

     You can make sure you are associating the right group with the team by hovering over it and clicking the information icon ![](assets/info-icon.png) that displays next to it. This displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and its administrators.
