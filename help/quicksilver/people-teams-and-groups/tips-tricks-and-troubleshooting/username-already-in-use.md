## Question

When creating a new user, a [!UICONTROL Whoops] error is displayed stating that the username is already taken. There are no other occurrences of this email in the system. Why is this being displayed?

## Solution

This can occur either because the username or email address is not unique in the current [!DNL Adobe Workfront] instance. Users can have the same username or email address in separate instances. For example, User A could have the following email addresses associated with a [!DNL Workfront] account: usera@company1.com and usera@company2.com.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The primary [!DNL Workfront] administrator can't have the same username or email address if they are in separate Workfront instances on the same cluster.   
>
>If the instances are on different clusters, the primary admin can have the same username or email address. You can view the cluster your instance is on under [!UICONTROL Setup] > [!UICONTROL System] > [!UICONTROL Customer Info].

### Check if your username is unique in your instance

Ensure that the username and email address is unique in the current [!DNL Workfront] instance:

{{step-1-to-users}}

1. In the list of people, look in the **[!UICONTROL Email]** column to ensure there are no duplicate emails.
1. Add a column for username to the view.

   1. In the **[!UICONTROL View]** drop-down menu, click **[!UICONTROL Customize View]**.
   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Column]**.
   1. In the search field, type *[!UICONTROL username]*.
   1. Select **[!UICONTROL User]** > **[!UICONTROL Username]**.
   1. Save the view.  
      This results in a view to display the usernames where you can look for the duplicate.

1. In the list of people, look in the **[!UICONTROL Username]** column to ensure there are no duplicate usernames.
