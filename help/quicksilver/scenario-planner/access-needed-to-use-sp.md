# Access needed to use the Scenario Planner

The Scenario Planner requires an additional license. For information about the Workfront Scenario Planner, see [The Scenario Planner overview](../scenario-planner/scenario-planner-overview.md).

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: might need to add information about the permissions to plans/ initiatives if those will be coming later?) </p>
-->

Without correct access or permissions, you may not be able to view the Scenarios area of Adobe Workfront nor manage plans or initiatives for your organization.&nbsp;Managing plans and initiatives includes creating, editing, and deleting them.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>When accessing Scenarios, you can only view and manage plans that you created. If you want to allow other users to view or manage the plans you created, you must do the following: 
>
>* Send a link to your plan to other users
>* Share the plan with other users 
>
>  For information about sharing a plan, see [Share a plan in the Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/share-a-plan.md). 
>
>When a user is deactivated, their plans have no owner and cannot be accessed unless previously shared with a link.

* An access level with at least View access to Scenario Planner.

  For information about the access level to Scenario Planner, see [Grant access to Scenario Planner](../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-sp.md).

* Manage permissions to a plan that you didn't create. For information about the permissions needed to access plans and initiatives that you didn't create, see the [Permissions needed to access plans and initiatives](#permissions-needed-to-access-plans-and-initiatives) section in this article.

## Permissions needed to access plans and initiatives {#permissions-needed-to-access-plans-and-initiatives}

Access Levels work together with permissions in&nbsp;Workfront to give you visibility into plans and initiatives that you did not create. In addition to having the correct access level to access the Scenario Planner, you must also have the correct permissions to the plan that you want to view or manage, if you are not the creator of those plans.

By default, you have access only to plans that you created. To view plans that other users created they must share their plans with you. For information about sharing plans, see [Share a plan in the Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/share-a-plan.md).

If a user shares a link to a plan without also sharing the plan, you can request permissions to the plan. For information about requesting permissions to plans, see [Request access to a plan in the Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/request-access-to-plan.md).
