## Permissions needed to access plans and initiatives 

Access Levels work together with permissions in [!DNL Workfront] to give you visibility into plans and initiatives that you did not create. In addition to having the correct access level to access the [!DNL Scenario Planner], you must also have the correct permissions to the plan that you want to view or manage, if you are not the creator of those plans.

All users, including system administrators, have access only to plans that they created. 

To view plans that other users created they must share their plans with you in the following ways: 

* Share the plan with you
  
  For information about sharing plans, see [Share a plan in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/share-a-plan.md).

* Send a link to a plan they created
  
  If a user shares a link to a plan without also sharing the plan, you can request permissions to the plan. For information about requesting permissions to plans, see [Request access to a plan in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/request-access-to-plan.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>When a user is deactivated, their plans have no owner and cannot be accessed unless previously shared with a link.
