## Create or edit plans

You can create a plan from scratch or you can edit an existing one that was shared with you.

>[!NOTE]
>
>After you create a plan, you are considered the plan creator and owner. When a user is deactivated, the plan has no owner and is not visible to anyone unless previously shared with a link.

This article describes how you can create a plan from scratch or you can edit an existing plan.

For all considerations about plans including the information available for a plan, see [Plans overview in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/plans-overview.md).

For information about deleting plans, see [Delete plans in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/delete-plans.md).

To create or edit a plan:

{{step1-to-scenario-planner}} 

   A list of existing plans that you created displays in the [!DNL Workfront Scenario Planner]. 

1. (Optional) Click the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** icon ![](assets/filter-icon-34x37.png)in the upper-right corner of the plan list, and select from the following:

   | Filter |Description  |
   |---|---|
   | [!UICONTROL All] |Displays all plans that you created or that have been shared with you.  |
   | [!UICONTROL My plans] |Displays plans that you created.  |
   | [!UICONTROL Shared with me] |Displays plans shared with you.  |

   ![](assets/plans-filters-dropdown-options-scenario-planer.png)

1. (Optional) Click the **[!UICONTROL Search]** icon ![](assets/search-icon.png) to type a keyword and quickly locate a plan in the list. 

1. Click the name of an existing plan to edit it and continue with step 7.

   <!--
   <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: is the step still accurate) </p>
   -->

   Or

   Click **[!UICONTROL New Plan]** in the upper-left corner to create a plan and continue with step 5.

   <!--
   <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: is the step still accurate)</p>
   -->

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to save the monthly job role distribution

   Or

   Click **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to close the job role distribution list and return to the scenario. 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Financial]** box in the header of the plan, to add the budget for this plan.

   The details of the [!UICONTROL Financial] box display.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The currency that [!DNL Workfront] uses for this plan displays in parentheses in the title of the box.

1. Specify the **[!UICONTROL Yearly budget]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If your plan spans multiple years, you must specify a budget amount for each year.

1. Press Enter to save the yearly budget, then [!UICONTROL Tab] to move to the following year.

   The yearly budget is automatically distributed equally for each month of the selected year. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** to see the monthly budget distribution. The yearly and monthly budgets are always rounded numbers. When the budget amount cannot be distributed equally to all the months within a year because of decimals a **[!UICONTROL Remaining]** indicator displays under the yearly budget distribution.

   ![](assets/adanced-and-remaining-links-on-plan-budget-350x507.png)

1. Manually adjust the monthly budgets to eliminate the exceeding amounts.

   When the total of all monthly budget amounts is larger than the yearly budget, an **[!UICONTROL Exceeding]** warning indicator displays under the yearly budget distribution. Manually adjust the monthly budget amounts until they are equal or lower to the available budget for the plan.

   ![](assets/exceeding-budget-warning-on-plan-350x483.png)

1. Disable the **[!UICONTROL Include people costs]** setting to exclude costs associated with job roles from counting towards the overall cost of the plan. Fixed Costs are always counting towards the overall cost of the plan. This setting is enabled by default and affects all scenarios on the plan. 
1. Click anywhere outside the [!UICONTROL Financial] box to close it. The information you entered is automatically saved.

   You can now start creating the initiatives on the plan, and adding scenarios. 

1. (Recommended) Click **[!UICONTROL New initiative]** to add a new initiative.

   <!--
   <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: Should this include information on how to create scenarios - see also information about scenarios in Manage Plans?)</p>
   -->

   For information about adding initiatives, see the article [Create and edit initiatives in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/create-and-edit-initiatives.md).

1. (Optional) Make a copy of the existing scenario to create a new scenario of the same plan. For more information about creating and working with multiple scenarios, see [Create and compare plan scenarios in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/create-and-compare-scenarios-for-a-plan.md). 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Plan]**.

   Your plan is created or updated.

1. (Optional) Click the **[!UICONTROL Favorites icon]** ![](assets/favorites-icon-small.png) to the right of the plan name to add the plan to your list of Favorites. 

1. (Optional) Copy the URL of the plan and send it to any other user that might need to review or update it. They must have at least [!UICONTROL View] access in their access level to be able to view the plan. They must have [!UICONTROL Edit] access to edit it. If they must review financial information on the plan, like budgets, costs, and job role rates information, they must also have access to [!UICONTROL Financial Data] in their Access level.
