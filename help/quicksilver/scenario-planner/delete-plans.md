## Delete plans

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You cannot recover deleted plans.

You can delete a plan or you can delete one scenario in a plan.

* [Delete plans](#delete-plans) 
* [Delete scenarios](#delete-scenarios)

### Delete plans

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Consider the following when deleting plans:
>
>* All information related to the plan is also deleted. This includes all the scenarios and initiatives associated with the plan including information about job roles and costs. This information cannot be recovered.
>* If the plan contains a published scenario, the projects linked to the deleted initiatives are preserved and the [!DNL Scenario Planner] area remains in the [!UICONTROL Project Details] section. 
>
>  For information about publishing initiatives to projects, see [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.md).

To delete a plan:

{{step1-to-scenario-planner}}

   A list of plans displays. 

1. Click the name of a plan to open it.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL More menu]** ![More menu](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the plan name, then click **[!UICONTROL Delete]** > **[!UICONTROL Yes, delete it]**.

   The plan is deleted and you return to the list of plans.

### Delete scenarios {#delete-scenarios}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Consider the following when deleting a scenario: 
>
>* Deleting a scenario deletes all initiatives and their information from the scenario. If they are copied to other scenarios, the initiatives remain on the other scenarios. 
>* When deleting a scenario, the subsequent scenario takes on the number of the deleted scenario and the counting order is preserved. For example, if you delete Scenario 4, Scenario 5 becomes Scenario 4. 
>* If some initiatives on the scenario are published, the project linked to the initiative is preserved and the Scenario Planner area remains on the linked projects 
>* If the published initiatives exist on another scenario, they remain on that scenario, including their link to the project. Publishing those initiatives from the other scenarios updates the linked projects with new information from those scenarios. 
>
>  For information about publishing initiatives to projects, see [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.md).

To delete a scenario:

1. Go to the plan for which you want to delete a scenario.

   By default, the Initial scenario displays.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Compare scenarios]**.
1. From the upper-right corner of the scenario card, click the **[!UICONTROL More]** menu ![More menu](assets/more-menu.png), then click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

   The scenario is deleted.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save plan]** to save your changes.
