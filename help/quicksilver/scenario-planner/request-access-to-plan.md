  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, or if your company has purchased the [!DNL Workfront Scenario Planner], contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you can request access to a plan in the [!DNL Scenario Planner], you must have the following:

* A link to the plan.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you do not have access level rights to the [!DNL Scenario Planner] and you try to access a plan from a link, you cannot request access to the plan. Instead, a screen displays informing you to contact the [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Request access for plans in the [!DNL Workfront Scenario Planner]

If you do not already have permissions to a plan and you navigate to it from a link shared with you, a screen displays to inform you that you do not have permissions to view the plan. You are prompted to request permissions from the plan creator.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can only request permissions from the owner or creator of a plan. You cannot request permissions from other users who also have access to the plan.

To request permissions:

1. Click a link to a plan.

   ![](assets/request-access-to-plan-350x277.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Request access to]** drop-down menu, indicate what level of permissions you wish to be granted. Select from the following:

   * [!UICONTROL View]
   * [!UICONTROL Manage]

   You cannot request a permission that is higher than your access level to the [!DNL Scenario Planner]. For example, you cannot request [!UICONTROL Manage] permissions if you have View access to the [!DNL Scenario Planner].

   For information about the different levels of permissions, see [Share a plan in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/share-a-plan.md).

   For information on a Workfront administrator can manage access to the [!DNL Scenario Planner], see [Grant access to [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-sp.md). 

1. (Optional) Enter a comment or request in the **[!UICONTROL Leave comment box]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Request access]**.

   The following happens: 

   * [!DNL Workfront] sends an email notification to the plan owner where they can grant the permissions requested.  
     ![](assets/request-access-to-plan-email-350x156.png)

   * After the plan owner grants the permissions requested, you receive an email that the permissions have been granted if your [!DNL Workfront] administrator has the Object share to user notification enabled in your system and you enable the [!UICONTROL Someone shares an object with me] email notification in your profile.

     ![](assets/access-granted-to-plan-email-350x172.png)

   * You can also grant permissions to plans from the [!UICONTROL Home] area and from the [!DNL Workfront] mobile app.

   For information about enabling system notifications, see [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md).

   For information about enabling notifications in your profile, see [Notifications: Miscellaneous information](../workfront-basics/using-notifications/notifications-misc-information.md).
