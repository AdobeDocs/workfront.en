# Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]

Publishing a scenario from the [!DNL Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner] accomplishes the following:

* Creates projects from the initiatives on the scenario and links them together.
* Updates projects already linked to initiatives on the scenario with information from the linked initiative. Projects can also be linked to initiatives when you import them in to a plan. For information, see [Import projects to plans in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/import-projects-to-plans.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

* You must create and save a plan before you can publish initiatives from it.
* The Allow users to create projects without using a template setting must be enabled in your Project Preferences area of the Setup. For information, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

## Considerations about publishing initiatives to projects

* You can publish only one scenario from a plan. 
* One initiative can be linked to only one project.
* One project can be linked to more than one initiative when the initiatives belong to different plans.

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >When a project exists on multiple plans and you publish information to the project from all plans, the latest publish overwrites the existing [!DNL Scenario Planner] information on the project.

* If initiatives were created on the plan by importing projects to the plan, publishing the initiative also updates the linked projects with initiative information.

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >You can import the same project into multiple plans. Publishing might overwrite initiative information on a project that is linked to multiple initiatives.

  For information about creating initiatives by importing projects, see [Import projects to plans in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/import-projects-to-plans.md). 

* Any changes made to the project do not transfer to the linked initiative.

 

## Publish initiatives

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you make any changes to initiatives on the plan, including resolve conflicts, you must republish the initiative in order for the new information to be visible on the project. This information displays on the projects linked to initiatives only when you publish the corresponding the initiative. For information about resolving conflicts between initiatives, see [Resolve initiative conflicts in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/resolve-conflicts-in-sp.md)

     ![](assets/scenario-planner-filter-after-publishing-initiatives-350x81.png)

1. Go to the following areas to view initiative information on the project:

   * **The [!UICONTROL Updates] section**: An update publishes to indicate that the project was created or updated from the initiative. The update contains the name of the initiative that created or updated the project and the linked name of the plan that contains the initiative. You can click the name of the plan in the update to open the plan in the [!DNL Scenario Planner].

     ![](assets/update-stream-confirmation-of-publish-on-project-350x65.png)

1. (Optional) Review the following information in the [!DNL Scenario Planner] after you published a scenario:

   * The published scenario becomes the first scenario after you publish initiatives from it. 
   * You cannot publish from any other scenario after you have published a scenario at least once. 
   * The [!UICONTROL Go to Publish] option is removed from all other scenarios after at least one initiative has been published from a scenario. 
   * A green indicator displays next to the published initiatives' project icons in the plan.

     ![](assets/indicator-for-published-initiative-icon-350x119.png)

   * A green "Published" indicator displays at the top of the scenario and on the scenario card and the Published field is populated on the scenario card indicating the number of initiatives in the scenario that have been published.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >If all the projects published from the scenario's initiatives are deleted, the indication that the scenario has been published is removed. For information, see [Delete projects](../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/delete-projects.md).

1. (Optional) Update information on the initiative and repeat the process described above to republish the initiative and update initiative information on the linked project.
