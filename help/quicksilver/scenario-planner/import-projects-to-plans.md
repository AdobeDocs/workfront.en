# Import projects to plans in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]

You can import existing projects into a plan. The imported projects are converted to initiatives and you can manage them within the plan as you would manage a new initiative. The original project remains linked to the new initiative.

<p>(NOTE: add information about what happens when you import projects and where the info from projects show up;</p>
<p>- the hours/ FTE come from WorkPerDay</p>
<p>- if a task has a Duration of 0, the FTE should be 0 for that asignee but it should still come across) </p>

## Considerations about importing projects into plans as new initiatives

* You must create projects before you can import them into a plan as new initiatives.

  <!--
  <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: no caveats for project statuses yet, mentioned in the import steps as a tip) </p>
  -->

* You must have at least [!UICONTROL View] permissions to the projects to be able to import them into a plan as new initiative. 
* You can import the same project into multiple plans. 
* The projects you want to import must have dates included in the time frame of your plan. You cannot import projects with a [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date] earlier than the start of the plan or a [!UICONTROL Planned Start Date] later than the end of the plan. 
* You cannot import more than 100 projects at a time. 
* Some project information is also imported into the plan and becomes initiative information. For information about what project information is imported into the plan and becomes initiative information, see the [Project information imported into the plan](#project-information-imported-into-the-plan) section in this article. 
* Changes that occur on the linked projects do not affect the initiatives on the plan. 
* Changes that occur on the initiatives on the plan do not automatically affect the linked projects Initiative changes affect the linked projects only when you publish the initiative from the plan. For information about how publishing initiatives affects the linked projects, see [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.md). 
* Deleting an initiative that has been created by importing a project does not delete the project. 
* Deleting a project linked to an initiative does not delete the initiative.

## Project information imported into the plan {#project-information-imported-into-the-plan}

When you import a project into a plan some project information is also imported into the plan and it becomes initiative information. The following table shows what project information becomes initiative information when you import a project into a plan:

   <td>Project Planned Dates</td>

   <td> <p>Initiative Job Roles. </p> <p>Note:   <p>If a user changes roles during the life of the project, the roles that are imported depend on the status of the assignment when you import the project. The following scenarios exist:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <p>If a user assigned to a task or an issue changed their role after they marked their assignment as [!UICONTROL Done], [!DNL Workfront] imports to the initiative the role the user fulfilled before they marked the assignment as [!UICONTROL Done].</p> </li> 
      <li> <p>If a user assigned to a task or issue changed the role during the life of the project but their assignment on the task or issue is not marked as [!UICONTROL Done] when you import the project, [!DNL Workfront] imports only the current role of the assigned user. </p> </li>

## Import projects into a plan

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>After importing projects into a plan, they become initiatives on the plan. Although the two items are linked, they exist as independent entities and do not automatically affect each other when they are updated. 
>
>The following occur:
>
>* Changes to the project never affect the initiative after you import the project into the plan.These changes include changes to the job role allocations. 
>
>  <!--
>  <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: this might change if projects will ever affect initiatives automatically) </p>>
>  -->
>
>* Changes to the initiative affect the information in the [!DNL Scenario Planner] area on the project only when you publish the initiative to the corresponding project. Otherwise, they do not affect the [!UICONTROL Planned Hours] information for the tasks and issues of the project. 
>
>  For information about how publishing initiatives affects the linked projects, see  [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.md).

{{step1-to-scenario-planner}}

1. Click the name of a plan where you want to import projects.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL New Initiative]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Import Projects]**.

   The [!UICONTROL Import Projects] box displays. Projects that have dates included in the time frame of your plan display in a list.

   ![](assets/project-import-ui-projects-selected-350x72.png)

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Projects in any status display in the list.

   <!--
   <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: the status of the projects in the import projects UI might change; right now it's ALL statuses)</p>
   -->

1. (Optional) Click the **[!UICONTROL Filter icon]** ![](assets/filter-nwepng.png)and select an available filter from the list to reduce the amount of projects on your list. By default, the list of projects is filtered by the user's currently selected project filter in a list of projects. 

1. (Optional) Click the **[!UICONTROL Search icon]** ![](assets/search-icon.png) and add a keyword displayed on any field on the screen. The items containing the search word display in the list automatically and all items are hidden. 

1. (Conditional) Click the **[!UICONTROL X icon]** to remove the search and display all projects. 
1. Select up to 100 projects and click **[!UICONTROL Import]**.

   The projects are imported as new initiatives.

   Notice the following:

   * A project icon ![](assets/project-icon-sp.png) displays to the right of the initiative name.
   * If the project timeline exceeds the duration of the plan, the bar of the initiative ends with a pointed margin to the left (when the Start Date is earlier than the plan's date) or to the right (when the End Date is later than the plan's date).

     ![](assets/project-bar-earlier-than-the-plan-start-date-350x39.png)

   * The number of months and job roles have been updated to match those of the project.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The costs associated with the job roles update at the initiative level and are not imported from the project.

1. Click the bar representing the new initiative to open the initiative details panel to the right.

   ![](assets/initiative-duration-with-project-duration-details-panel-350x292.png)

   In the **[!UICONTROL Initiative Duration]** area review the following information: 

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Initiative Duration]</td> 
      <td>This is the duration of the initiative in months. </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Initiative]</td> 
      <td>The Start and End dates of the initiative. </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Project]</td> 
      <td> <p>The [!UICONTROL Planned Start] and [!UICONTROL Completion dates] of the linked project.</p> <p>Tip: If the [!UICONTROL Project] information is missing, the project was deleted.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Edit the name of the initiative. By default, it matches the name of the project. 
1. (Optional) Do one of the following:

   * Update job roles in the **[!UICONTROL Required Job Roles]** section
   * Update the **[!UICONTROL Fixed Costs]** in the **[!UICONTROL Costs]** section
   
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Update available job roles]** or **[!UICONTROL Update available budget]** to resolve conflicts between the new initiative and other initiatives on the plan.

1. (Conditional) Click **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to save changes to your initiative. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Plan]** to save the changes to your plan. 
1. (Optional) To update the changes you make to the initiative back to the project it was imported from, publish the project from the plan. For information about publishing plans, see [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.md). 
1. (Optional) Click the project icon to access the linked project.
