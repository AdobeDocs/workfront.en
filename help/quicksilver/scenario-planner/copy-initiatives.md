## Copy initiatives

Consider the following when copying initiatives:

* Copying an initiative places the copy on the same plan as the original initiative. 
* Copying an initiative copies and adds the following information from the original initiative to the new initiative:

    * [!UICONTROL Duration]
    * [!UICONTROL Job roles]
    * [!UICONTROL People] and [!UICONTROL Fixed Costs]
    * [!UICONTROL Planned Benefit]

* Copying an initiative can modify the following information for the plan, if the information exists on the original initiative:

    * Required amount of job roles 
    * [!UICONTROL Costs]
    * [!UICONTROL Plan Utilization]
    * Job role utilization
    * [!UICONTROL Net Value]

* Copying an initiative that was created by importing a project or has been published to a project at least once has the following implications:

    * It does not duplicate the project associated with the initiative.
    * It does not connect the copied initiative to the project. 
    * It does not modify the [!DNL Scenario Planner] section on the project, for projects that have been published at least once.

     For information about publishing initiatives to projects, see [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.md).

     For information about creating initiatives by importing projects, see [Import projects to plans in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/import-projects-to-plans.md).

## Copy initiatives

{{step1-to-scenario-planner}}

   A list of plans displays. 

1. Click the name of a plan to open it, then locate the initiatives you want to copy.
1. Select the box to the left of the initiative or initiatives that you want to copy, then click **[!UICONTROL Copy]** from the menu that appears at the bottom of the plan.

   ![](assets/bottom-manage-initiative-menu-350x45.png)

   [!DNL Workfront] copies the initiatives immediately and places them underneath the last selected initiative.

   The name of the copied initiative is *[!UICONTROL Copy of] `<Name of original initiative>`*.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Depending on where you insert the new initiatives, the numbers of existing initiatives may change.

1. Update the name of the copied initiative.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >We recommend that you always update the name of the initiative to avoid confusion in case you want to copy them again.

1. (Optional) Update the priority of your newly created initiatives.

   For information about prioritizing initiatives, see [Update initiative priorities in the [!DNL Scenario Planner]](../scenario-planner/prioritize-initiatives.md). 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Plan]** to save your changes.
