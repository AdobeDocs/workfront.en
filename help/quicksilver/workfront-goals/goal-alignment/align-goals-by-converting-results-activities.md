## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.
* An existing goal with existing results and activities.

  For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>A goal cannot have more than a total of 50 activities, results, or aligned goals.

## Considerations when converting results and activities into goals

Sometimes, a result or an activity may have a larger scope than anticipated and it would make more sense that they would become goals. You can convert results and activities of an existing goal to a new goal.&nbsp;This is a bottom-up approach to aligning goals.

Consider the following when converting results and activities to goals:

* The converted result or activity becomes the child goal of the original goal, and the two goals become aligned.
* The converted result or activity is removed from the original goal and added as a result or activity to the newly created goal. 
* The newly created goal becomes the single progress indicator for the original goal, if there are no additional results or activities on the original goal.

## Convert a result or activity to a goal

1. Go to a goal that has a result or an activity that you want to convert to a goal.
1. Click the name of the goal to open the **Goal Details** panel.
1. Expand the **Results** or **Activities** right-pointing arrows to see a list of results or activities for the goal. 

1. Click the **gear icon** ![](assets/settings-gear-icon.png) to the right of the result or activity name that you want to convert, then click **Convert into a Goal**.

1. (Optional) Remove the name of the original activity or result owner from the **Goal Owner** field and replace it with another user, team, group, or your organization's name. By default, Workfront selects the owner of the result or the activity as the goal owner. 
1. Click&nbsp;**Convert**. The activity or result displays as an aligned goal in the Goal&nbsp;Details panel of the original goal and the original activity or result is removed from the original goal and transferred to the second goal. By default, the new goal has the same name as the original converted result or activity. 
1. (Optional) Click the name of the new goal to open the **Goal Details** panel and edit the name of the goal. For information about editing any information for an existing goal, see [Edit goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/edit-goals.md).
