# Align goals by connecting them in Adobe Workfront Goals

If you are an individual contributor who has a personal goal, you may want to align it to your team's goals in order to effectively display the progress of your own goal in the larger context of your organization's strategy.

When everyone in your organization has their goals aligned to your organization's goals, they can clearly see how their individual contributions and team efforts help to move the needle forward on larger, company-level priorities. For more information about the best practices for aligning goals, see [Goal alignment overview in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/goal-alignment-overview.md).

There are two approaches to connecting goals in Adobe Workfront Goals:

* You can create alignment between goals by connecting goals to one another. 

* You can manually align two goals or you can convert results and activities of an existing goal to another goal. The converted result or activity becomes the child goal of the original goal. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>A goal can have a total of 1000 progress indicators.

This article describes how you can align goals by connecting them to one another. For information about aligning goals by converting results and activities to goals, see [Align goals by converting results and activities to goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/align-goals-by-converting-results-activities.md).

## Align goals by connecting them to one another

<!--
Aligning goals by connecting them differs depending on what environment you use. 

### Align goals by connecting them in the Production environment

1. Create two goals that you want to align. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).
1. (Optional) Activate the goals that you want to align. You can align goals that have a Draft, Active, or Inactive status. For information about activating goals, see [Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/activate-goals.md).
1. Go to the goal that you want to align (child goal) to another goal (parent goal) and click its name to open the **Goal Details** panel.

   For example, if you want Goal 2 to influence the progress of Goal 1, you must go to Goal 2. 

1. Click **Align to another goal** in the upper-right corner of the right panel.

1. Click **Save**.

   The goal you started with (Goal 2) is now the child goal of the goal you aligned it with (Goal 1).   
   The aligned goals display connected in the Goal Alignment section with Goal 2 as secondary to Goal 1.
