## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.

##  Considerations about removing goal alignment

Consider the following when removing alignment between two goals:

* The parent goal must have another goal, activity, or result associated with it to be able to stay Active.
* You cannot remove an aligned child goal from a parent goal if it is the only progress indicator of the parent goal. 
* The child goal becomes a standalone goal when you remove its alignment to the parent goal.

## Remove goal alignment

1. Go to a child goal aligned to a parent goal. 
1. Click the goal name to open the **Goal Details** panel. 
1. ```Click the **gear icon** ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png) next to the parent goal.```

   ![](assets/edit-remove-alignment-350x88.png)

   The goal becomes a standalone goal and its progress no longer influences the progress of the original parent goal. 

1. (Optional) Click **Undo** in the lower-left corner of the screen if you want to revert this change and keep the goals aligned. 
1. (Optional)&nbsp;Add activities and results to either goals to indicate their progress. For information about adding activities and results, see the following articles:

   * [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md) 
   * [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md)
