# Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals

<!--Audited for P&P only: 4/2025-->

When you create a goal, Adobe Workfront Goals saves it with a status of Draft. Drafted goals are not part of goal management.

To keep track of how close you are to achieving a goal by updating its progress, you must activate it. This changes its status to Active. 

For information about creating a goal, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You must activate a goal before you can update the progress of its results and activities.
