# Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals

When you create a goal, Adobe Workfront Goals saves it with a status of Draft. Drafted goals are not part of goal management.

To keep track of how close you are to achieving a goal, you must activate it. This changes its status to Active. For information about creating a goal, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).

## Access requirements
