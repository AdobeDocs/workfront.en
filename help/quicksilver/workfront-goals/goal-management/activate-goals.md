# Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals


<!--drafted for goal redesign:

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment.</span> -->

When you create a goal, Adobe Workfront Goals saves it with a status of Draft. Drafted goals are not part of goal management.

To keep track of how close you are to achieving a goal by updating its progress, you must activate it. This changes its status to Active. 

For information about creating a goal, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You must activate a goal before you can update the progress of its results and activities.

*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main Menu.

To activate a goal requires that the goal is associated with a progress indicator like an activity, result, project, or it is aligned to another active goal.

Do at least one of the following to be able to activate a goal:

* Add a Result to the goal

  For information, see [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md).

* Add an Activity to the goal

  For information, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md). 

* Connect a project to the goal

  For information, see [Add projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../results-and-activities/connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md). <!--drafted for goal redesign: update the title of the article here, when goal redesign releases-->

* Align another goal to the goal you want to activate

  For information , see [Align goals by connecting them in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/align-goals-by-connecting-them.md).

## Activate goals

You can activate goals you created or a goal that you have Manage permissions to.

1. Go to a goal that you want to activate.

   For example, go to the Goal List and click the name of a goal. The Goal Details panel opens on the right.

   <!-- drafted for goal redesign: replace the last sentence above with this at preview: 
   In the Production environment, the Goal Details pabel opens on the right.
   <span class="preview">In the Preview environment, the goal page opens.</span> --> 

1. Click the **More** menu ![](../goal-management/assets/more-icon.png) to the right of the goal name in the Goal Details panel<!--drafted for goal redesign: <span class="preview">or on the goal page</span>-->, then click **Activate**.

   Or

   <!--drafted for goal redesign: In the Production environment,click--> 
   Click **Activate** in the Goal Details panel.

   The goal status changes to Active. You can now track progress on the goal and the goal displays in the Check-in section as well as is taken into account in the Graphs sections of Workfront Goals
