*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main Menu.

## Locate the Comments area

<!--
Locating goal comments differs depending on what environment you use. 

### Locate goal comments in the Production environment

You can add comments to goals in the following areas of Workfront Goals:

* The Goal Details panel
* The Check-in section 
* The Pulse section

Although the process for adding comments to goals is similar in these areas, there are differences in being able to edit, delete, or react to a comment when using one area versus another. When you enter a comment in any of these areas, the comment is visible in all areas where goal comments display.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot add comments to results and activities.
