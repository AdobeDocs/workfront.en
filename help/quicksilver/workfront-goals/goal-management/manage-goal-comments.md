# Manage goal comments in Adobe Workfront Goals

<!--Audited: 01/2024-->

<!--consider retiring this article when goals and all objects are in parity and we remove the legacy commenting from the system. From then on, there is just ONE way to comment and that will be documented in the Update Work article-->

<!--take "legacy" and "new commenting" references out when we remove the legacy - April 2024???-->

<!--<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment for all customers. </span>

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Navigating away from the Updates section before you finish typing and submitting a comment keeps the comment on the page in draft mode even after you log off and log back on. Any images that are added to the comment are also saved in the draft. Drafts are saved for 7 days after which they are discarded and cannot be recovered. Drafted comments are only visible to the user entering them.

1. (Optional) To undo or redo a change, use the following shortcut keys:
      * CTRL + Z (⌘+z for Mac) to undo a change 
      * CTRL + Y (⌘+y for Mac) to redo a change 
1. (Optional) To add rich-text formatting to your update, a hyperlink, or an image, use any options on the Rich Text toolbar or the icons adjacent to it. For more information, see [Update work](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md). 
1. (Optional) In the **Tag people or teams** area, start typing the name or the email of a user, or a team that you would like to include in this comment, then select it when it displays in the list.

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >If another user submits a comment to the same item you are updating, there will be a red line with a "New" indicator to inform you of the newer comments, as well as a blue notification at the bottom of the screen indicating the number of new comments. 
      >
      >The indicator only displays only after the comment was submitted on the item, and not when the comment is still composed. 
      >![](assets/real-time-new-red-indicator-unified-commenting-copy.png)

   >[!TIP]
   >
   > * An email is generated to notify users of your update only when you submit the original update. No email is generated after you edited your update.

1. (Optional) Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-icon.png), then click any of the following options to copy information from a comment to the clipboard or into a new reply:

      * **Copy link** to copy the link of an update, without the replies.

1. (Optional) Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-icon.png) to the right of a comment, then click **Delete** to delete a comment you added. For more information, see [Update work](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).
