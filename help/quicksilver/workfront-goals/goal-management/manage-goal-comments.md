   >Navigating away from the Updates section before you finish typing and submitting a comment keeps the comment on the page in draft mode even after you log off and log back on.

Drafted comments are only visible to the user entering them.

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >If another user submits a comment to the same item you are updating, there will be a red line with a "New" indicator to inform you of the newer comments. 
      >
      >The indicator only displays only after the comment was submitted on the item, and not when the comment is still composed. 
      >
      >The "New" indicator displays only when both the user that entered a new update as well as the user who is currently entering an update are using the new commenting experience. 
      >![](assets/real-time-new-red-indicator-unified-commenting.png)

Locating goal comments differs depending on what environment you use. 

### Locate goal comments in the Production environment

You can add comments to goals in the following areas of Workfront Goals:

* The Goal Details panel
* The Check-in section 
* The Pulse section

Although the process for adding comments to goals is similar in these areas, there are differences in being able to edit, delete, or react to a comment when using one area versus another. When you enter a comment in any of these areas, the comment is visible in all areas where goal comments display.

>[!NOTE]
