## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.

## Locate the Comments area

You can add comments to goals in the following areas of Workfront Goals:

* The Pulse section

Although the process for adding comments to goals is similar in these areas, there are differences in being able to edit, delete, or react to a comment when using one area versus another. When you enter a comment in any of these areas, the comment is visible in all areas where goal comments display.
