Workfront Goals helps you define, communicate, and achieve strategic outcomes by connecting strategy to work execution and delivery. You can focus everyone's efforts on what truly matters, make progress measurable, and enable teams to accomplish amazing results. People can do their best work knowing their contributions have a meaningful impact.

Workfront Goals is an add-on module for the core Workfront work management platform. It is intended to work together with Workfront with which it shares many of the setup elements and configuration entities, such as users, teams, groups, and projects.
