*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main Menu.
* You created the goals you want to edit or you have Manage permissions to them.

## Considerations about editing goals

* You cannot edit goals with a status of Closed. 
* You can edit goals from any time period.

  You can edit the following information for a past goal:

  * Name
  * Time period
  * Status

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >If the goal is Closed, reopening it recalculates the Progress percent complete. You cannot edit a closed goal.

  * Description
  * Results and activities

## Edit goals

<!--drafted for goal redesign: 
Editing goals differs depending on what environment you use.

### Edit goals in the Production environment

-->


1. Go to a goal that you want to edit and click the goal name to open the **Goal Details** panel. 
1. Click the **More icon** ![](assets/more-icon.png), then click **Edit**.

   ![](assets/edit-goal-highlighted.png)

1. Update the name of the goal in the **Goal** field. 
1. Select a time period when the goal should be completed.

   Select from the following predefined options:

   * The current year
   * The quarters of the current year
   * The next two years
   * The quarters of the next two years

   Or

   Click **Define custom dates** to select a custom time frame. 

1. (Conditional) Select a start and an end date for your goal, if you clicked **Define custom dates**.

   <!--
   <p>(NOTE: these fields don't yet have a name) </p>
   -->

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >You cannot create a goal with custom dates in the past.

1. (Optional) Click **Reset custom dates** to return to the predefined options.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >We recommend that everyone in your organization selects the same time frames for similar goals or goals that are aligned. This provides better alignment between goals and ensures that everyone's work supports your larger organization-wide strategy.

1. Click the **Owner** field and select a new owner for the goal, if you want to indicate someone else as the owner of the goal. 
1. (Conditional) Start typing the name of a user, team, group, or the name of your organization in the **Owner** field, then select it when it displays in the list. You can have only one owner for a goal. 
1. Update the **Description** of the goal, then click **Save**.

### Edit goals in the Preview environment


(CHECK all the fields in each of these sections, as the UI might not have been completed when I wrote these steps):


1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png), then click **Goals**.  
A list of goals displays.
2. Click a goal.  
The goal page displays. 
3. Do one of the following to edit information for the goal:
    * Click fields that display in the goal header to update them. Not all fields in the header are editable. 
    * Click the **More icon** ![](assets/more-icon.png) to the right of the goal name, then click **Edit**. 
    * Click **Goal details** in the left panel and click the **Edit icon** ![](assets/edit-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click **Edit all**. Start updating fields in the Goal Details section. 
    
   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Not all fields that display in the areas mentioned above can be edited. Workfront calculates some of the fields and they are read-only. 
4. (Conditional) Depending on what you selected in the previus step, update the following information about the goal:

   * Update the following information in he goal header, then press Enter to save your changes:
      * **Goal name**: Click the name of the goal and start typing a new name.
      * **Owner**
   * Update the following information information in the Edit Goal box, then click **Save**: 
      * **Goal name**
      * **Period**: Click to update the time period for the goal  
         Or  
         Select **Enable custom dates** to specify dates for the goal's **Start** and **End dates**. 

         >[!TIP]
         >
         >Deselect **Enable custom dates** to return to the original time period for the goal. 

      * **Goal owner**: Click to update the name of the owner of the goal. Start typing the name of a user, team, group, or the name of your organization, then select it when it displays in the list. You can have only one owner for a goal.
      * **Description**: Add or update information about the goal. 
   * Update or review information in the Goal details section. For more information, see [Update goals in the Goal Details panel in Adobe Workfront Goals](../goal-management/update-goals-in-goal-details-panel.md). 

   (should you update the title here after changing it at production???)

5. (Optional)  Click **Progress Indicators** in the left panel to add results, activities, or projects to the goal. By adding progress indicators you ensure you can track the goal's progress.
For more information, see the following articles: 
    * [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md)
