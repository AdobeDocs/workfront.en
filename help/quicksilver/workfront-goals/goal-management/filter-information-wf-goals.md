## Overview of filters in Workfront Goals

>[!NOTE]
>
>To efficiently find and focus on the right goals, we recommend that you use filters in Workfront Goals. This allows you to display the correct information before you start managing goals that are important to you. By default, Workfront Goals displays all goals in the system. 

You can locate and filter for goals in following sections of the Goals area in Workfront:

* Goal List 
* Graphs
* Goal Alignment

For information about the sections of the Goals area, see [Overview of the Adobe Workfront Goals sections](../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/overview-of-wf-goals-sections.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You can configure filters for one section and they remain persistent when moving to another section of Workfront Goals.

Consider the following when working with filters in Workfront Goals:

* You can create and apply a filter without saving it, or you can save a filter to reuse at a later time.

  The following scenarios exist:

   * When you save a filter, it becomes the default filter for you every time you log in to Workfront Goals. 
   * When you apply a filter without saving it, you can revert to the original lists by refreshing your page.

* You can only view and apply filters you created. Filters created by other users display only for those users. 
* You cannot share filters you created with other users.

## Apply a quick filter in Workfront Goals

You can use a quick filter in a list of goals to help you locate only items that are important to you. You cannot save quick filters and they are not persistent. Workfront clears the results of a quick filter when you refresh the page.

For more information, see [Apply the quick filter to a list](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/apply-quick-filter-list.md). 

## Create and apply a filter in Workfront Goals

The process for creating filters is the same for any section of Workfront Goals.

You can create a filter from scratch or edit one of the built-in filters.

1. Go to the Workfront Goals.

   For information about accessing Workfront Goals, see [Access and open goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/access-goals-in-wf-goals.md)

   By default, the Goal List section displays. 

1. Click **Filter** in the upper-right corner of the list.

   ![](assets/filter-icon-and-label.png)

   By default, Workfront applies the **All** filter which displays all goals in your system.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You cannot edit or delete the All filter.

1. Do one of the following:

   * Click any of the following predefined filters to display goals only for the following owners:

     <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
      <col> 
      <col> 
      <tbody> 
       <tr> 
        <td>All</td> 
        <td> <p>All goals in your system, regardless of who created them, what the time period for them is, or who the owner is. This is the default filter and you cannot edit it. </p> <!--
          <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: what the ALL filter displays might change; right now, it displays all, regardless of status, period, owner, etc)</p>
         --> </td> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td>Personal</td> 
        <td>The goals for which you are the owner.</td> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td>My teams</td> 
        <td> <p>The goals for which any of your teams is selected as the owner. </p> <p><b>TIP</b>
        
        No goals display when you are not assigned to any teams. </p> </td> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td>My groups</td> 
        <td>The goals for which any of your groups is selected as the owner. </td> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td>Company</td> 
        <td> <p>The goals associated with your organization. </p> <p><b>TIP</b>
        <p>In Adobe Workfront Goals, the Company filter displays the goals for which your organization is selected as the owner. </p> <p>You cannot search for companies using this field. Only your organization who is the owner of your Workfront instance is selected by default. </p> </p> </td> 
       </tr> 
      </tbody> 
     </table>

   * Hover over the name of a filter, then click the **Edit** icon ![](assets/edit-icon.png) next to its name to customize it and add specific names of users, teams, groups, or the name of your organization, then select it when they appear on the list.

   * Click **New Filter** to create a new filter, then select from the following options to customize the new filter:

     <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
      <col> 
      <col> 
      <tbody> 
       <tr> 
        <td role="rowheader">Period</td> 
        <td>Select a time period in the drop-down menu. You can select multiple time periods. </td> 
       </tr>

       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td role="rowheader">Owner</td> 
        <td> <p>Start typing the name of an owner, then select it when it appears in the list. </p> <p>You can type the names of users, teams, groups, or the name of your organization or you can select from predefined options. </p> <p>The following predefined filter options always refer to the user who is currently logged in: </p> 
         <ul> 
          <li> <p><strong>Me</strong>: Displays goals where you are the owner.</p> </li> 
          <li> <p><strong>My Home Team</strong> and <strong>All My Teams</strong>: Displays goals where either your Home Team or any of your teams are designated as the owner. </p> <p>Tip: No goals display when you are not assigned to any teams. </p> </li> 
          <li> <p><strong>My Home Group</strong> and <strong>All My Groups</strong>: Displays goals where either your Home Group or any of your groups are designated as the owner.</p> </li>
