For more information about guidelines for creating and managing goals, see [Adobe Workfront Goals overview](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/wf-goals-overview.md).

## Create goals

This article describes how you create a goal in Workfront Goals.

You can create a new goal in one of the following ways:

* [Create a goal from scratch](#create-a-goal-from-scratch) 
* [Copy an existing goal](#copy-an-existing-goal) 
* [Convert a result or activity to a goal](#convert-a-result-or-activity-to-a-goal)

### Create a goal from scratch {#create-a-goal-from-scratch}

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) > **Goals** in the upper-right corner.

   <!-- Add this when Shell is available to all: or (if available), click the **Main Menu** icon ![Main menu icon](../goal-management/assets/three-line-main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-left corner)
   -->

   ![](assets/main-menu-align-icon-highlighted-350x463.png)

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can add a goal from any section in Workfront Goals. The process for creating a goal is identical regardless of the section you choose to add the goal from.

1. Start typing what you want to achieve in the **Goal** field. This is the name of the goal and a required field. 
1. Select a time period when the goal should be executed in the **Period** drop-down menu. This is a pre-filled field. The default is the current quarter.

   Select from the following predefined options:

   * The current year
   * The quarters of the current year
   * The next two years
   * The quarters of the next two years

   Or

   Click **Define custom dates** to select a custom time frame. 

1. (Conditional) Select a **Start date** and an **End date** for your goal, if you clicked **Define custom dates**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >* You can create a goal with dates in any time period, including up to 2 years in the past. 
   >* When defining custom dates, they are constrained by the initial date you selected. So if you select quarter and then custom dates, you can't go beyond that quarter.

1. (Optional) Click **Reset custom dates** to return to the predefined options.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >We recommend that everyone in your organization selects the same timeframes for similar goals or goals that are aligned. This provides better alignment between goals and ensures that everyone's work supports your over-arching strategy.

1. (Optional) Click your name in the **Owner** field, if you want to indicate someone else as the owner of the goal. By default, you are the owner of goals you create. 
1. Start typing the name of a user, team, group, or the name of your organization in the **Owner** field, then select it when it displays in the list. You can have only one owner for a goal. 
1. (Optional) Enter a **Description** for the goal. This field is optional. 
1. Click **Save**.

   The status of the new goal is Draft.
