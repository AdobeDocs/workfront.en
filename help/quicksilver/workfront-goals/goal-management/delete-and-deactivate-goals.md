# Delete and deactivate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals

When you start working on a goal and it becomes irrelevant in your organization, we recommend deactivating it, instead of deleting it. Deactivating a goal keeps its historical information and gives you a chance to reactivate it at a later time. There are times, however, when deleting a goal might make sense, to keep your goal list accurate.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td>
