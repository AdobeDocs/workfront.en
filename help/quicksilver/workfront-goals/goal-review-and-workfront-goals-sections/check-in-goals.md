## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.

## Considerations for checking in on goals

Consider the following when checking in on your goals:

* Workfront Goals automatically calculates the progress of a goal when you manually update the progress of the results and activities of the goal.

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >You cannot update progress directly on a goal. You must update the progress of activities and results which in turn update the progress of the goal.

  See also the following articles:&nbsp;

   * For information about adding activities to goals, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md).
   * For information about adding results to goals, see [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md). 
   * For information about how Workfront Goals calculates the progress on a goal, see [Calculate goal progress in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/calculate-goal-progress.md).

* You must create goals and activate them before you can check in on them.

  See also the following articles:&nbsp;

   * For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).
   * For information about activating goals, see the [Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/activate-goals.md).

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >You cannot check in on goals that are drafted, closed, or inactive.

* The first time you or someone else updates the progress of a result or activity on a goal, the goal Progress changes from&nbsp;New and Workfront Goals starts recording progress and progress status updates on the goal.

## Check in on goals

You can check in on goals at the individual goal level, or you can check in on multiple goals from the Check-in section of Workfront Goals.

* [Check in on individual goals](#check-in-on-individual-goals)

### Check in on individual goals {#check-in-on-individual-goals}

When you check in on a goal at the goal level, you can update the progress of the results and activities that are assigned to you or other users.
