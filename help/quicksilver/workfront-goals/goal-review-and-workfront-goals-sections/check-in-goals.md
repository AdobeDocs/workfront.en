*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main Menu.
* An active goal. You cannot update progress on goals that are drafts, inactive, or closed. 

## Considerations for updating goals

Consider the following when updating progress on goals:

* Workfront Goals automatically calculates the progress of a goal when you  update the progress of its progress indicators.

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >You cannot update progress directly on a goal. You must update the progress of the goal's progress indicators (activities, results, connected projects) which in turn updates the progress of the goal. To update the progress on projects, you must update the tasks on the project. 

  See also the following articles:

   * For information about adding activities to goals, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md).
   * For information about adding results to goals, see [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md). 
   * For information about how Workfront Goals calculates the progress on a goal, see [Overview of goal progress and condition in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/calculate-goal-progress.md).

* You must create goals and activate them before you can update their progress. 

  See also the following articles:

   * For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).
   * For information about activating goals, see the [Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/activate-goals.md).

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >You cannot update the progress of goals that are drafted, closed, or inactive.

* The first time you or someone else updates the progress of a result or activity on a goal, the goal Progress changes from New and Workfront Goals starts recording progress and progress status updates on the goal.

<!--

## Update goal progress by using Check-in in the Production environment

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> <span class="preview"> The Check-in functionality has been removed from the Preview environment and will be removed from Workfront Goals with the 23.1 release. See the [Update goal progress in the Preview environment](#update-goal-progress-in-the-preview-environment) section in this article to update goal progress in Preview. </span>


You can check in on goals at the individual goal level, or you can check in on multiple goals from the Check-in section of Workfront Goals.
