After your Workfront administrator has granted you access to Workfront Goals, you can view goals that you or anyone else in your organization created in the Workfront Goals area.

You can access lists of goals or individual goals and manage them from several sections of Workfront Goals. Which section you use depends on the purpose you want to achieve as you are working with goals.

You can apply filters to display only the goals that are important to you in each section.

>[!TIP]
>
>Filters updated in one section are automatically applied to the Goal List, Graphs , and Goal Alignment sections. This way, you can update them only once. For more information, see [Filter information in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/filter-information-wf-goals.md).

Following is a brief overview of the sections of Workfront Goals and the options available for managing goals. For more information about additional actions that you can perform within each section of Workfront Goals, we also recommend the following articles:
