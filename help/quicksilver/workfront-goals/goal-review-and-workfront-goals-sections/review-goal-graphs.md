# Review graphs to understand goal progress trends in Adobe Workfront Goals

You can view the overall health of your goals and their progress trend in time in the Graphs section of Adobe Workfront Goals. The charts in this section do not break down the progress of each goal, but instead give you a holistic snapshot of all goals' progress status as well as their progress trend in time during a specified period.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>You can see a total count for your goals in the Graphs section for a selected period of time.&nbsp;However, Workfront Goals takes into account only goals with a status of Active and Closed when calculating the overall goal progress status and percent complete.

    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td>Baseline progress</td> 
      <td>The green slope line indicates the expected overall percent complete average of active and closed goals for the selected time period. All goals within a period are expected to complete, so the baseline progress is always 100% at the end of the period. </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td>Actual progress</td> 
      <td> <p>The blue line indicates the actual overall percent complete average of active and closed goals for the selected time period in weekly increments. Each week during the duration of the goal is marked by a node in the line. </p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Hover a week node in the goal progress chart and review the following:
