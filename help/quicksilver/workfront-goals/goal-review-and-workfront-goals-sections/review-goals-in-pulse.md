# Review goals in the Adobe Workfront Goals Pulse section

>[!IMPORTANT] 
> 
>The functionality described in this article has been removed from Workfront, starting with the 23.1 release.  
>This article will also be removed shortly after the 23.1 release, in early 2023. At this time, we recommend that you update any bookmarks accordingly.


You can view all goals in your organization, regardless of who the owner is. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).

You can use the Pulse section of Adobe Workfront Goals as a collaboration tool, where you can review and participate in a stream of updates about current goals that belong to you, your teams, groups, or organization and ensure that goals stay current. Workfront Goals groups progress updates, comments and editing history by goal in the Pulse section.

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.

## Manage goal updates and comments in the Pulse section&nbsp;

>[!TIP]
>
>Only goals that have been checked in on at least once display in the Pulse section.

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) > **Goals** in the upper-right corner of your screen.

   This opens the Workfront Goals area.

   All goals display by default.

1. Click **Pulse** in the left panel. 

      <!--
      <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
      (NOTE: see the numbering in the procedure)
      </MadCap:conditionalText>
      -->

   A list of goals displays. The list contains the following columns with information about each goal: 

      <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
      <col> 
      <col> 
      <tbody> 
      <tr> 
         <td role="rowheader">Goals</td> 
         <td>The goal name.</td> 
      </tr> 
      <tr> 
         <td role="rowheader">Owner</td> 
         <td>The name of goal owner.</td> 
      </tr> 
      <tr> 
         <td role="rowheader">Period</td> 
         <td>The time period for which the goal is scheduled.</td> 
      </tr> 
      <tr> 
         <td role="rowheader">Progress</td> 
         <td>The progress indicator for the goal which is typically a percentage value.</td> 
      </tr> 
      <tr> 
         <td role="rowheader"> <p>Status (includes alignment icon)</p> <p> <img src="assets/alignment-icon-large.png"> </p> </td> 
         <td> <p>The status of the goal which can be one of the following:</p> 
         <ul> 
         <li>Active</li> 
         <li>Draft</li> 
         <li>Inactive</li> 
         <li>Closed</li> 
         </ul> <p>The alignment icon appears on goals that are aligned to other goals. For information about aligning goals, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/align-goals-by-connecting-them.md" class="MCXref xref">Align goals by connecting them in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>.</p> 
         
      <p>The Status column also includes the incremental updates made for each result or activity with each check in on the goal.</p>

   For example, if the goal has one manual progress bar activity and you check in on the goal and update the activity to 50%, the  Status column displays 50% for that goal's activity. Later on, you might update the same activity to 60%. In this case, a new line displays under the same goal for the same activity for 10% - because you just added 10% to the progress of the activity. 
         </td> 
      </tr> 
      </tbody> 
      </table>

1. (Optional) Select the type of information you want to display by updating the filters in the upper-right corner of the Pulse section.

   The Pulse list displays goals and their updated history that match the criteria of your selected filter.

   For more information about filtering goals, see [Filter information in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/filter-information-wf-goals.md).

1. Click the right-pointing arrow to the left of the goal name to expand a goal and view additional information about the updates on each goal.

   The following information displays in the Pulse section under each goal:

   * Results names and owners. For information about results, see [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md).

For information about reviewing individual goals, see [Update goals in the Goal details section in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/update-goals-in-goal-details-panel.md).
1. (Optional and conditional) Click **the alignment icon** ![](assets/align-icon.png) to open the goal in the Goal Alignment section, if the goal is aligned to other goals.
