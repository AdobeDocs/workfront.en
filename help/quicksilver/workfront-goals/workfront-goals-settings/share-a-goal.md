<!--drafted for goal redesign:

*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main Menu.

## Considerations about sharing goals

* Users can have the following permissions to a goal:

   <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
   <col> 
   </col> 
   <col> 
   </col> 
   <tbody> 
   <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><p><b>Goal permissions</b></p></td> 
      <td>
      <p><b>Description</b></p> </td> 
   </tr> 
   <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><p>View</p></td> 
      <td>
      <p>Users have permissions to view the goal, but they cannot edit information for the goal, they cannot add or edit information for results, or activities, update status, or delete the goal.</p>      
      <p>By default, all users with access to Goals can view all goals in the system. Users can copy the goal, if they have Edit access to Goals in their access level.</p> </td> 
   </tr> 
   <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"><p>Manage</p></td> 
      <td> <p>Users can edit all information for the goal, including for the results, or activities, including delete them.</p> 
      <p>Only goal creators or users who are specifically given Manage permissions to a goal can manage a goal.</p> 
      Only users with Manage permissions to a goal can share the goal with others to give them Manage permissions to the goal. </p> </td> 
   </tr> 
   </tbody> 
   </table>

* You can share the following types of goals with others:

   * A goal you created 
   * A goal created by someone else to which you were given permissions to Manage.

* If you have Manage permissions to a goal, you can change the permissions on the goal for the goal creator. By default, they have Manage permissions when they create the goal, but you can change their permissions to View.

## Share a goal

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) > **Goals** in the upper-right corner.

   <!-- Add this when Shell is available to all: or (if available), click the **Main Menu** icon ![Main menu icon](../workfront-goals-settings/assets/three-line-main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-left corner)
   -->

   The Goal List displays. 

1. Click the name of a goal in the list. The Goal Details panel opens.

   <!--drafted for goal redesign:

   <span class="preview">In the Preview environment, the goal page opens.</span>-->

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can click the name of a goal from any section in the Goals area to open the Goal Details panel <!--<span class="preview">or the goal page</span>-->.

   ![](assets/more-menu-highlighted-goal-details-panel-with-share-link-350x156.png)

   </div>

   ![](assets/goal-access-sharing-box-manage-system-wide-deselected-350x400.png)

1. Do one of the following:

   * Select the **Manage system-wide** setting to give Manage permissions to everyone in the system who has Edit access to Goals in their access level. This is deselected by default for all new goals. 
   * Start typing the name of a user that you want to give Manage permissions to in the **Give Manage access to** box. Select the name when it appears in the list.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >You can only share a goal with other users. You cannot share goals with groups, teams, or your company.

1. Click **Share**.

   The goal is shared with the users you specified. A "System-wide" label or the name of the users who have Manage permissions to the goal display in the Access to Manage field in the Goal Details panel.

## Goal permission options

The following table lists the permissions that you can grant when sharing a goal. For more information about the access users get based on their license, see [Grant access to Adobe Workfront Goals](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-goals.md).
