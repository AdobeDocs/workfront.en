# Customize Adobe Workfront Goals terminology

Your organization must have the following to use the functionality described in this article:

* For the current plan and license structure: 

  * A Pro or higher [Adobe Workfront plan](https://www.workfront.com/plans). 
  * An Adobe Workfront Goals license in addition to a Workfront license.

* For the new plan and license structure:

  * An Ultimate plan 
    
    Or
    
    An additional license for Adobe Workfront Goals for the Prime or Select Adobe Workfront plans. 

Contact your Workfront account manager to learn about a Workfront Goals license.

For additional information about access to Workfront Goals, see [Requirements to use Workfront Goals](/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/goal-management/access-needed-for-wf-goals.md).

For more information, see [Access requirements in Workfront documentation](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-level-requirements-in-documentation.md). 

A Workfront or group administrator can customize the names of objects in Workfront Goals to better match your organization's terminology. 

For example, your organization might not use the concept of "goals" but they do use the concept of "objectives". Your Workfront or group administrator can replace the name "goal" with "objective" everywhere in Workfront Goals for everyone, or for people in your group.

As an administrator, you can customize the following Workfront Goals object names using a layout template and assigning it to Workfront Goals users:

* Goal
* Result
* Activity

Customizing Workfront Goals terminology is identical to customizing terminology in Workfront.

For information about customizing terminology in Workfront, see [Customize user interface terminology using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-terminology.md).
