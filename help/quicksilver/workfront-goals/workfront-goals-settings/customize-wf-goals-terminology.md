A Workfront or group administrator can customize the names of objects in Workfront Goals to better match your organization's terminology. 

For example, your organization might not use the concept of "goals" but they do use the concept of "objectives". Your Workfront or group administrator can replace the name "goal" with "objective" everywhere in Workfront Goals for everyone, or for people in your group.

As an administrator, you can customize the following Workfront Goals object names using a layout template and assigning it to Workfront Goals users:

* Goal
* Result
* Activity

Customizing Workfront Goals terminology is identical to customizing terminology in Workfront.

For information about customizing terminology in Workfront, see [Customize user interface terminology using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-terminology.md).
