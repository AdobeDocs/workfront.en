# Customize Adobe Workfront Goals terminology

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: keep drafted and only leave the LT article as is)</p>

Your organization must have the following to use the functionality described in this article:

* A Pro or higher [Adobe Workfront plan](https://www.workfront.com/plans). 
* An Adobe Workfront Goals license in addition to a Workfront license.

  Contact your Workfront account manager to learn about a Workfront Goals license.

For additional information about access to Workfront Goals, see [Requirements to use Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/access-needed-for-wf-goals.md).
The Workfront administrator can customize the names of objects in Workfront Goals to better match your organization's terminology. For example, your organization might not use the concept of "goals" but they do use the concept of "objectives". Your Workfront administrator can replace the name "goal" with "objective" everywhere in Workfront Goals.

As a Workfront administrator, you can customize the following Workfront Goals object names using a layout template and assigning it to Workfront Goals users:

* Goal
* Result
* Activity

Customizing Workfront Goals terminology is identical to customizing terminology in&nbsp;Workfront.

For information about customizing terminology in Workfront, see [Customize user interface terminology using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-terminology.md).
