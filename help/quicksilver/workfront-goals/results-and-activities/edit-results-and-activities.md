&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.

## Considerations when editing results and activities

* You can edit results and activities that belong to goals you created or to goals that you have permissions to Manage. 
* You cannot edit projects that are connected to goals as activities from Workfront Goals. You can remove them from the goal by disconnecting them. For more information, see the "Disconnect projects"&nbsp;section in the article [Remove results, activities, and projects from goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/remove-results-activities-from-goals.md).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If the following project information updates at the project level, Workfront Goals automatically updates it at the goal level:
  >
  >   
  >   
  >   * Project owner
  >   * Project name
  >   * Project percent complete
  >   
  >   
  >For information about connecting projects to goals, see [Overview of connecting projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md).

* You can delete results and activities from goals when they are not longer relevant to the goal progress. Deleted results and activities cannot be recovered. For information about deleting results and activities, see [Remove results, activities, and projects from goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/remove-results-activities-from-goals.md).
* You can edit results and activities associated with goals from any time period, including in the past. 
* Editing results and activities updates their settings and does not update their progress. You must update the progress of results and activities by checking in on goals. For information about checking in on goals, see [Check in on goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/check-in-goals.md).
