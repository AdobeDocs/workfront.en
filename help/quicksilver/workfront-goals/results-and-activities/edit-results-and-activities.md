*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main Menu.

## Considerations when editing results and activities

<!--
According to Vazgen, access levels will add more considerations.)
-->

* You can edit results and activities that belong to goals you created or to goals that you have permissions to Manage. 
* You cannot edit the progress of projects that are connected to goals as activities from Workfront Goals. Projects progress is updated when tasks in the project are completed. You can remove projects from the goal by disconnecting them. For more information, see the "Disconnect projects" section in the article [Remove results, activities, and projects from goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/remove-results-activities-from-goals.md).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If the following project information updates at the project level, Workfront Goals automatically updates it at the goal level:
  >
  >   
  >   
  >   * Project owner
  >   * Project name
  >   * Project percent complete
  >   
  >   
  >For information about connecting projects to goals, see [Add projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md).

* You can delete results and activities from goals when they are no longer relevant to the goal progress. Deleted results and activities cannot be recovered. For information about deleting results and activities, see [Remove results, activities, and projects from goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/remove-results-activities-from-goals.md).
* You can edit results and activities associated with goals from any time period, including in the past. 
* Editing results and activities updates their settings and does not update their progress. You must update the progress of results and activities. For information about updating progress on goals, results, and activities, see [Update goal progress in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/check-in-goals.md).
