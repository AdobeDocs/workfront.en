# Get started with results and activities in Adobe Workfront Goals

Your organization must have the following to use the functionality described in this article:

* For the new plan and license structure:

  * An Ultimate plan 
    
    Or
    
    An additional license for Adobe Workfront Goals for the Prime or Select Adobe Workfront plans. For information, see [Adobe Workfront plan](https://www.workfront.com/plans). 
    
* For the current plan and license structure: 

  * A Pro or higher 
  * An Adobe Workfront Goals license in addition to a Workfront license.

Contact your Workfront account manager to learn about a Workfront Goals license.

When you create a goal, the goal has a status of Draft. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).

In order to start recording progress on a goal, you must activate it. To activate your goal and change its status to Active you must first add the following to it:

* A result
* An activity 
* A project
* An aligned goal

After at least one of these items is added, you may activate the goal. You must update the results and activities of goals to indicate progress on the goal.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> A goal cannot have more than a total of 1000 activities, results, projects, or aligned goals.</span>

This article gives an overview of activities and results. For information about aligning goals, see [Goal alignment in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/goal-alignment.md). For information about connecting projects to goals, see [Add projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../results-and-activities/connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md).

## Results overview

<!--
<p> This will have additional types in the future - add another section for types?)</p>
-->

Results measure the progress of your goal or how close to achieving it you are. As the goal owner, you can also own the result. A result to your goal might also be assigned to a different user.

For information about adding results to goals, see [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md).

You can add results to your own goals or goals that belong to other entities in your organization. 

Consider the following when working with results:

* They answer the question, "How will I know when my goal is complete?" 
* They are metric indicators. You can select from the following options to indicate a progress for your result: 

  <!--
  this might change (jira, Salesforce, etc))
  -->

   * Currency
   * Number
   * Percentage

For more information about results, see the list of similarities between results and activities in the section [Similarities between results, activities, and projects](#similarities-between-results-activities-and-projects) in this article.

## Activities overview

<!--
This will have additional types in the future - add another section for types?
-->

Activities, like results, are specific and measurable, and typically include a percent complete indicator. As the goal owner, you can also own the activities associated with the goal. An activity on your goal might also be assigned to a different user.

For information about adding activities to goals, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md).

Consider the following when associating activities with your goals:

* They answer the question, "What will I achieve when the goal is complete?" 
* Activities are custom entries that can be thought of more in terms of complete or incomplete. They must be manually updated to indicate what percentage of the activity has been completes thus far. 

<!--
* You can associate the following activities with goals:

  <table style="table-layout:auto"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Manual progress bar </td> 
     <td> <p>Custom entries that can be thought of more in terms of complete or incomplete. They must be manually updated.</p> </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader"><p>Project</p></td> 
     <td> <p>Existing projects that you have at least permissions to View and are not in a status of Dead. They are updated automatically, based on the progress of their work items. </p> <p>The projects must exist before associating them with the goal. You can associate a project with multiple goals. For information about adding projects to goals, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md" class="MCXref xref">Add projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>.</p>
     <p><span class="preview">In the Preview environment, projects are separate progress indicators, independent from activities. Adding projects to a goal in the Preview environment is different from adding activities.

For more information about results and activities, see the list of similarities between results and activities in the section [Similarities between results, activities, and projects](#similarities-between-results-activities-and-projects) in this article.

## Similarities between results, activities, and projects {#similarities-between-results-activities-and-projects}

Results, activities and projects are goal progress indicators. 

There are some differences in the way you manage projects versus the way you manage results and activities. For information about adding projects to goals, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md). For information about projects connected to goals, see [Add projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md).

In addition to results, activities, and projects, you can also associate children goals to a goal. Children goals are also a type of progress indicator for a goal. For information, see [Align goals by connecting them in Adobe Workfront Goals](../goal-alignment/align-goals-by-connecting-them.md). The progress of the children goal's progress indicators also drives the progress of the parent goal.

The following table displays similarities and differences between results, activities, and projects, as goal indicators:
