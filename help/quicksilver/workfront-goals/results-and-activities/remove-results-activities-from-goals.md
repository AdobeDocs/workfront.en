# Remove results, activities, and projects from goals in Adobe Workfront Goals

<!-- for goal redesign PRODUCTION RELEASE: Should this article be called "Remove or disconnect progress indicators from goals" when this is available to ALL progress indicators (including "disconnect goals")-- if yes, updte the title everywhere else where this is linked?
-->

You can remove results, activities, and projects from goals if they are no longer relevant.

For information about creating goals, and adding results and activities to them, see the following articles:

* [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md) 
* [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md) 
* [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md) 
* [Edit results and activities in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/edit-results-and-activities.md)

Goals can also be aligned to parent goals, becoming children goals. Children goals are also progress indicators of the parent goals.

You can remove the alignment between goals by removing the connection between them. For information, see [Remove goal alignment in Adobe Workfront Goals](../goal-alignment/remove-goal-alignment.md).

*To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main Menu.
* A goal with results, activities, or projects.

## Considerations for removing results, activities, and disconnecting projects from goals

* You can remove results and activities only from active goals. 
* You can remove results and activities from a goal by deleting them. Deleted results and activities cannot be recovered. 
* When you remove the result or activity from a goal, the progress of the removed result or the activity affects the overall progress of the goal. 
* You cannot delete a project from a goal, but you can disconnect it from the goal. By disconnecting the project from the goal the percent complete of the project no longer affects the progress of the goal.

  For information about how projects affect goal progress, see [Add projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md). 

* You cannot remove a result or an activity from a goal, and you cannot disconnect a child goal or a project, if they are the last progress indicator for the goal. 
* If a project is deleted from the Projects area and it is the last progress indicator of a goal, the goal becomes Inactive.
