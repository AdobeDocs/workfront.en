You can create calculated fields in Adobe Maestro where the values are calculated automatically, rather than manually. Formula fields generate a new value using existing values from other fields in a record type and a function that indicates how the existing values should be calculated. 

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto">
 <col>
 <tbody>
<td>
   <p> Adobe product</p> </td>
   <td>
   <p> Adobe Workfront</p> </td>
  </tr>  
 <td role="rowheader"><p>Adobe Workfront agreement</p></td>
   <td>
<p>Your organization must be enrolled in the Adobe Maestro closed beta program. Contact your account representative to inquire about this new offering. </p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td role="rowheader"><p>Adobe Workfront plan</p></td>
   <td>
<p>Any</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td role="rowheader"><p>Adobe Workfront license</p></td>
   <td>
   <p>Any</p> 
  </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
   <td role="rowheader">Access level</td>
   <td> <p>Any</p>  
</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
   <td role="rowheader">Layout template</td>
   <td> <p>Your system administrator must add the Maestro area in your layout template. For information, see <a href="../access/grant-access.md">Grant access to Adobe Maestro</a>. </p>  
</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<!--Maybe enable this at GA - but Maestro is not supposed to have Access controls in the Workfront Access Level: 
>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md). -->

<!-- Notes to add for the table: for the "Workfront plans" row: the above is only for closed beta; when going to GA - activate the following plans:    
<p>Current plan: Prime and Ultimate</p>
<p>Legacy plan: Enterprise</p>-->

<!-- Notes for the table: for the "Workfront access" row: <p>For more information, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md" class="MCXref xref">Adobe Workfront licenses overview</a>.</p>--> 

## Considerations about formula fields

* Formula fields reference fields that belong to the same record type. You cannot reference fields from other record types when creating a formula field. <!--is this still accurate??-->
* You cannot change the Field type of a Formula field after you saved it. 
* You can update the calculation of a formula field after you save it, and the results of the calculation update automatically for all the records of the same type. 
* For more information about Maestro fields, see [Create fields](../fields/create-fields.md).
