# Delete workspaces

In Adobe Maestro, workspaces are centralized locations for teams to plan work. For more information, see [Create workspaces](../maestro/create-workspaces.md). 

You can delete workspaces that are no longer relevant.

## Considerations about deleting workspaces

* You can delete any workspace that either you or anyone in your organizaton has created. <!--this will change with access levels and permissions-->
* When you delete workspaces, all the record types, taxonomies, and their fields are also deleted. <!--asked Lilit because the confirmation says the records don't delete, but not sure how they can exist outside of a workspace?!-->
* Deleted workspaces cannot be recovered. 

## Delete  a workspace

1. Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-workfront.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click **Maestro** ![](assets/maestro-icon.png). 

    This opens the last workspace you accessed. 

1. (Optional) Expand the downward-pointing arrow to the right of an existing workspace name and select the workspace that you want to delete. 
1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) next to the workspace name, then click **Delete**.
1. Click **Delete** to confirm.

    The workspace is deleted and cannot be recovered.
