# List of available workspace templates

In Adobe Maestro, workspaces are centralized locations for teams to plan work. 

A workspace is a collection of operational record types and taxonomies used by a team and represents the team's work lifecycle. 

Maestro comes with a set of templates to get you started with basic record types, taxonomies, and fields.  

This article describes the workspace templates available in Maestro. 

Consider the following about Maestro templates:

* Each template comes with a set of record types and taxonomies. For information, see [Overview of record types and taxonomies](../architecture-and-fields/overview-of-record-types-and-taxonomies.md).
* Each record type and taxonomy comes with a set of fields. Some of these fields are Relationship-type fields that link record types and taxonomies together. 
* You can customize any template.
