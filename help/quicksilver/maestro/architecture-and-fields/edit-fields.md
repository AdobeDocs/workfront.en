# Edit fields

>For information, see [Adobe Maestro overview](../maestro-overview.md).

You can edit the field settings for fields that are already created. 

For information about creating Adobe Maestro fields, see [Create fields](../architecture-and-fields/create-fields.md). 

This article describes how you can edit the settings for Maestro fields. For information about editing field values for Maestro records, see [Edit records](../records/edit-records.md). 

## Considerations about editing field information

* You can edit fields that you created or fields created by other users. <!--this will change with access levels/ permissions-->
* You can edit a field in the record type table. 
* You cannot edit the Field type, after the field is saved.
* You cannot deselect the Allow negative numbers setting that was previously selected, for a Number, Percentage, or Currency field if there are already negative values stored on the records it is attached to. 
<!--this is not true yet; one piece of it is true and I added it as the bullet above: 
* You cannot edit the options, or the special format of the following fields, after they are saved:

    * Allow negative numbers option from a Number, Percentage, or Currency field. 
    * The Options of a Single-select or a Multi-select field.
-->

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md). -->

<p>Legacy plan: Enterprise</p>-->
