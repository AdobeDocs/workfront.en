# Manage Adobe Workfront Planning notification preferences 

{{maestro-important-intro}}

When someone adds you to a comment in the record page, you may receive an in-app as well as an email notification about the comment. 

The following scenarios exist:   

* Adobe Unified Experience customers receive both an in-app notification and an email notification. They can manage their in-app and email notification preferences in the Preferences area of their Adobe Experience Cloud profile for the Workfront product. 

    For more information, see [Account preferences and notifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/features/account-preferences).

* Customers who are not on the Adobe Unified Experience receive only an email notification. They cannot manage their email notifications preferences and will always receive an email when someone adds them to a comment on a record in Workfront Planning.
