# Create Maestro fields

In Adobe Maestro, you can create custom fields for operational record type or taxonomy. You can then associate the fields with Maestro records to enhance the information you store about records. 

You must create record types before you can create fields to associate with them. For information, see [Create operational record types](../maestro/create-operational-record-types.md).

*If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level.

## Considerations about Maestro fields

* The fields associated with a record type are available to be associated with all the records of that type. <!--will this change and will the fields be available for other record types, too?! Also, the next bullet might need to change too if this one changes -->

* Fields associated with a record type cannot be added to another record type. <!-- this will change when they open the Field library tab when creating a field-->

* Maestro creates fields by default every time you create a record type. The following are standard fields created by default for each new operational record type:

    * Name
    * Description
    * Start Date
    * End Date
    * Status. The default values for record statuses are:
        * Development
        * Planned
        * Active
        * Completed
        * On Hold

    The following are the fields created by default for each new taxonomy record type:

    * Name <!--will more be added? If not, consider rephrasing this bullet-->

    You can add more values or rename the existing ones. 

* You can view and update all the fields that any other user added to any record type. <!--this will change with access/ permissions-->

* You can also automatically create field by doing one of the following:
    * Linking existing record types together and accessing the fields from the linked record type, when using Relationship-type fields. 
    
        For more information, see the [Create fields by linking record types](#create-fields-by-linking-record-types) section in this article. 
    * Linking new Maestro record types to objects from other applications and accessing their fields. 
        <!--* Importing record types with fields using a CSV or an Excel file. - this is not available yet-->

        For more information about creating Maestro records by linking them to objects from other applications, see [Create operational record types](../maestro/create-operational-record-types.md).
* You cannot have more than 500 fields for one record type.
* Field names can have up to 250 characters.
* You can create fields on the record type page, in the Table view. The columns of the table are the fields associated with the record type. They are the same fields that display on a record's Details page. 
* When deleting an operational record type, taxonomy, or workspace, all fields associated with them are also deleted and cannot be recovered. <!-- this might change with a possible recycle bin solution?!-->


## Create fields from scratch {#create-fields-from-scratch} <!--in a table (not sure if this can be done elsewhere?!-->

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-workfront.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, <!---or the **Main menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-shell.png)  in the upper-left corner, if available--> then click **Maestro** ![](assets/maestro-icon.png).

### Relationship {#relationship}

You can use a relationship field to link record types and their fields to one another. By doing this, you can display fields from the linked record on another record.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>    You cannot manually update the values of linked fields from linked record types. They are automatically updated from their original records.


For more information about creating a relationship field, see the section [Create fields by linking record types](#create-fields-by-linking-record-types) in this article.  


## Create fields by linking record types {#create-fields-by-linking-record-types}

You can create fields on a record type by linking it to another record type's fields by creating a Relationship-type field. 

1. Start creating a field for a record type, as described in the section [Create fields from scratch](#create-fields-from-scratch) in this article, then select the **Relationship** field type. This is the original record type. 

    ![](assets/relationship-field-type.png)

1. Add the following information:
     * **Name**: The name of relationship-type field, as it will appear in the table view or the Details page of a record of the original record type. This creates the linked record column in the table view of the original record type or the linked record field for the original records. <!--ensure they updated this; and update the screen shot: it used to be "Label"-->

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >We recommend that you include the name of the record you are linking to in the name of the relationship-type field to capture what record type the new field is coming from. 

     * **Description**: Additional information about the relationship-type field.
     * **Find a record type**: The record type that you want to link to. This is the linked record. 
     * **Allow multiple records**: This allows users to select multiple records when the linked record type field displays on the original records. This is selected by default.

1. (Optional) Select the fields that belong to the linked record type that you want to display as linked fields on the original records. Use the **search** icon ![](assets/search-icon.png) to search for a field. 

    This creates the linked record field column in the table view of the record type or the linked record fields for the original records. A column or a linked field is added for each field you add from the linked record. 

    If you don't select any of the fields, the name of the linked record is the only visible field in the original record's table view and in the Details page of the record. This is the linked record column or field for the original record type. 

1. (Optional and conditional) For number, currency, percentage, or date-type fields, select how you want the values for the linked field to be aggregated. 

    ![](assets/linked-field-aggregators-for-relationship-fields.png)

    Select from the following:

    * **MAX**: Displays the maximum value in a string of values.
    * **MIN**: Displays the minimum value in  a string of values.
    * **SUM**: Adds all the values of the linked fields. 
    * **AVG**: Calculates the average of the values of the linked fields.

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >If you do not select an aggregator, individual values display separated by commas.


1. Click **Create**.

    The following fields (or columns) are added to the original record type in the table view:
        
    * The linked record field with the name you selected in step 2. <!--ensure this stays accurate--> 
    * The linked field from the linked record which is named according to this pattern: 

        `The name of the original field on the linked record (from The name of your linked field)`

### Example of creating a Relationship-type field

This section describes an example of how to create a field by linking record types together. 

For example, you have a record type named Campaign as your original record type. 

You also have another record type called Program which has a currency field called Budget. 

You want to create a field on the record type of Campaign where you can show the values that users select for the Budget field on the record type Product. 

To do this:

1. Start by opening the table view for the Campaign record type. 
1. Click the **+** icon in the upper-right corner of the table view to add a new field, then expand the **Field type** drop down menu and select **Relationship**. 
1. Add the following information, for example:

    * **Name**: Program Budget. This is the name of the linked record field. 
    * **Description**: This is the budget of the program associated with this campaign. 
    * * **Allow multiple records**: Leave this option selected. This allows users to select multiple records when the linked record type field displays on the original records.
1. From the list of fields associated with the **Program**, select the **Budget** field. This creates a field called **Budget (from Program Budget)** which is the name of the linked field. 
1. (Optional and conditional) Select **SUM** in the drop-down menu to the right of the field name. When users select multiple programs in the **Program Budget** linked record field, the **Budget (from Program Budget)** field adds all their Budget values together and displays the total. 

    ![](assets/example-of-relationship-field-program-budget-with-sum.png)

    This generates two fields in the Campaign record table view and two fields in the Details page of a campaign: 

    * Program Budget (the linked record field)
    * Budget (from Program Budget) (the linked field) 
1. To populate the **Program Budget** field, go to the **Campaign** record type table view, then expand the **Program Budget** field. Select a program or multiple programs from the list. 

    ![](assets/program-budget-example-multiple-values-selected.png)
1. Click outside the **Program Budget** field to save the values.
    The values for the **Budget** field on the programs selected displays as a total in the **Budget (from Program Budget)** field on the campaign. The same fields display on the Details page of a campaign.

    ![](assets/example-of-linked-fields-on-details-page-of-campaign.png)

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >When you do not select an aggregator for the multiple values, all values display separated by commas. 
    >
    >![](assets/example-multiple-values-separated-by-commas-no-aggregator.png)


## Create fields by adding record types from other applications

In addition to the fields created automatically by Maestro when adding record types from another application, you can also add fields from the connected object. 

For information about adding record types from other applications, see [Create operational record types](../maestro/create-operational-record-types.md).
