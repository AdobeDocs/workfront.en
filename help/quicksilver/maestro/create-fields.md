# Create fields for Maestro records

You must create record types before you can create fields to associate with them.

The following are default fields that Workfront creates by default:

* Name
* Description
* Start Date
* End Date
* Status. The default values for record statuses are:
    * Development
    * Planned
    * Active
    * Completed
    * On Hold

    You can add more values or rename the existing ones.
