# Manage record views

<!--udpate the metadata with real information when making this avilable in TOC and in the left nav-->

You can display records in a table or in a timeline view when using Adobe Maestro. 

## Access requirements


## Create views

<!-- not sure how to break this article up?!? Should the views have different articles? Maybe for starters, before we know how similar the actual elements in the views will be (group, sort, filter, add records/ fields), we should just keep them separate; 
But if they are different - maybe we should have a Manage Table/ Manage Timeline sections in there or even separate articles?? 
Also - sections for each element: columns, rows, filter, group, sort - AND  ... timeline settings ???? 
-->

## Manage the table view

<!--insert screen shot of table view-->

When viewing records in a table, a combination of the following elements builds the view:  

* Columns: Display record fields. 
* Rows: Display individual records.
* Filter: Reduces the amount of information displayed on the screen.
* Grouping: Groups records by similar information. 
* Sort: Organizes information in a given order. 

To edit the table view:

1. From the **Main Menu**, click **Maestro**. 
    The workspace you last accessed opens by default. For information about creating workspaces, see [Create workspaces](../maestro/create-workspaces.md).
1. Click a record type. 
1. (Conditional) If the records display in the timeline view, click the view drop-down in the upper-right corner of the screen, then select **Table**. 
    
    By default, all the records of this type display by default in the table view.
1. Click the **View** drop-down menu, and select either an existing **table view** ![](assets/table-view-icon.png) or click **Create view > Table**. 
1. (Optional) Give the new view a name, then click **Create** to add a new view. 
    
    By default, Maestro names the view "Table < number >". The number is an automatically generated increment. 
1. (Optional) To delete a view, click the **More** icon next to the view name, then click **Delete > Delete**.
1. (Optional) Click the + icon to the lower-left of the table to start adding rows to the table. Each row is a new record. For information, see [Create records](../maestro/create-records.md). 
1. (Optional) Click the **+** icon in the upper-right corner of the table to start adding new fields. For information about creating fields, see [Create fields for Maestro records](../maestro/create-fields.md).

## Manage the timeline view

<!--insert screen shot of timeline view-->

In the timeline view, you can see a smaller read-only table where all records are listed in the left area of the screen. 
The right area displays the timeline for the records displayed in the table and places the records in a time frame according to the dates you choose to display in the view.
