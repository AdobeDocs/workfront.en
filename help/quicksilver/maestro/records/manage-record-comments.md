# Manage record comments

You can ollaborate on Adobe Maestro records, by adding updates and asking questions or replies in the Comments area of a record.

## Considerations about commenting on a record

* You can add comments and replies to operational records and taxonomies in Maestro, in the Comments section of a record. 

* Comments added to linked records do not display on the records you are linking from. For example, if you comment on a Project that is linked to a Campaign record, the comment displays only on the project record in Maestro and not on the campaign record from which you are linking. 

* Comments added to linked objects in other applications do not display in Maestro. 
    Comments added to linked objects in Maestro do not display in other applications.  
    For example, comments added to projects in Workfront do not display on the same project linked to a campaign in Maestro. 

* You can tag users to bring their attention to an update. Tagged users do not receive an in-app notification or an email about your update. You cannot tag teams in a Maestro comment. 

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >*   Comment owners are not automatically tagged in an update. 
   >
   >*   You cannot remove tagged users from an update when you reply to it. 
   
* You can add an update to records from the following areas of Maestro:

   * From the Details page.

   <!--* From the table view.-->
