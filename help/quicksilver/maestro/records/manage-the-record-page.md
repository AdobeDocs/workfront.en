# Manage the record page

{{maestro-important-intro}}

You can edit manage the layout of the record box and page in Adobe Workfront Planning. You can display the record box in a record view. 

The record box is a smaller view of the record page that displays in the view of a record type. 

When you change the layout of a record box and page, the box and page changes for all records of the same type. 

You must create record types and records before you can start editing record pages. 

For information, see the following articles: 

* [Create record types](../architecture/create-record-types.md)

* [Create records](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/create-records.md)

## Considerations about editing record pages

* Rearranging fields in the record box or page rearranges the fields for all the records of that type and for all users accessing those records. 
* Adding a cover image to a record is not part of the overall layout of the record box or page. You can add unique cover images to each record. For information, see [Add a cover image to a record](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/add-a-cover-image-to-a-record.md).

## Rearrange fields in the record box or page

The workspace that you access last opens. 

1. (Optional) Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the workspace name to select the workspace whose records you want to update. 
1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 

1. From a view of any type, click the name of a record 

    Or 
    
    From the table table view, click the **Open details** icon ![](assets/open-details-icon-in-table-name-field.png) to the left of a record name. 
    
    The record's box opens in the view.

    >You can view the **Open details** icon to the left of the Name field of a record in a table view only when the Name field is a primary field.

    The new position of the field is updated in both the box and the page of all records of the same type for all users viewing the records. 

    All changes to the layout of the record box or page save automatically.
