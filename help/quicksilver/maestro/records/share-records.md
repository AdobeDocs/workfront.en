# Share records

To collaborate with other users, you can share records with others. 

You can share a Maestro record in the following ways: 

* Copy the link of the Details page of a record from your browser when the page is open. 

* Copy a link to the record's Details page when viewing records in the record type's table view.   

This article describes how you can copy a link to a record's Details page from the table view of a record type. 

<!-- add information about permissions, like:
- in the table below, you must have at least View permissions to the record
- the user you're sharing with must have at least View permissions to the record to view it
- etc - others???-->

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto">

<!--Maybe enable this at GA - but Maestro is not supposed to have Access controls in the Workfront Access Level: 
>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md). -->

<!-- Notes to add for the table: for the "Workfront plans" row: the above is only for closed beta; when going to GA - activate the following plans:    
<p>Current plan: Prime and Ultimate</p>
<p>Legacy plan: Enterprise</p>-->

<!-- Notes for the table: for the "Workfront access" row: <p>For more information, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md" class="MCXref xref">Adobe Workfront licenses overview</a>.</p>--> 

## Share record links from the record type table view

    The workspace that you accessed last opens. 
1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 
1. (Conditional) From the **View** drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the table, select a table view. This should be the default view, unless you viewed the record type in the timeline view when you accessed it last. 

    The records associated with the selected record type display in the table view. 
1. Right-click a record row

    Or 

    Hover over a record's name then click the More menu ![](assets/more-menu.png), then click **Copy link**.

    The link is copied to your clipboard. 

1. Paste the link into an email, or chat window, to share with other users. When users receive the link, it opens the Details page of the record. 

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >The fields of the record in the Details page are the same fields available in the Table view of the record. 


    <!--add there when it will be available: if they have access to this record-->
