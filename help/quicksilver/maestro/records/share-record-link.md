# Share record links

You can share a link to an Adobe Maestro record to collaborate with other users. The link opens the record's Details page. 

You can share a link to the Details page of a record by copying the link of the Details page from your browser when the page is open. 

You can also copy a link to the record's Details page when viewing records in the record type table view. 

This article describes how you can copy a link to a record's Details page when working in the table view of a record type. 

<!--Should we add this: mention in here that the fields in the Details view are the same as the ones in the table view -- this article is linked from the Manage record views one to refer to this info???? - this used to be the case in the beginning but now with the ability to hide the fields in the table, the fields in Details will probably be persistent and the table will not match anymore and just act like a regular view. We do not document the connection between views and Details pages in WF. -->

<!-- add information about permissions, like:
- in the table below, you must have at least View permissions to the record
- the user you're sharing with must have at least View permissions to the record to view it
- etc - others???-->
