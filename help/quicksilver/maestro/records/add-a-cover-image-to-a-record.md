# Add a cover image to a record

You can personalize records by adding a cover image to the record page in Adobe Workfront Planning, when editing a record.

For information about editing records, see [Edit records](/help/quicksilver/maestro/records/edit-records.md). 

You must create record types before you can start creating and editing records.

## Considerations about record page cover images

You can personalize a record's page by adding a cover image to it. 

Consider the following: 

* A cover image is unique to one record, and it does not apply to all records of the same type. 
* You can add only image files as cover images.
   <!--above: when you know exactly what type of files are allowed, add the exact extensions above-->
* You can add a cover image to individual records from the record box in any view, or from the record page. 
* You cannot add cover images inline from any record views. 

## Add a cover image to a record

You can personalize a record by adding a cover image at the top of the record box or page.
