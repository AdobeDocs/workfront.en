You can edit record information in Adobe Maestro. You must create record types before you can start creating and editing records. 
For information, see [Create record types](../architecture-and-fields/create-record-types.md).

<!-- mention in here that the fields in the Details view are the same as the ones in the table view -- this article is linked from the Manage record views one to refer to this info-->

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto">
 <col>
 <tbody>
<td>
   <p> Adobe product</p> </td>
   <td>
   <p> Adobe Workfront</p> </td>
  </tr>  
 <td role="rowheader"><p>Adobe Workfront agreement</p></td>
   <td>
<p>Your organization must be enrolled in the Adobe Maestro closed beta program. Contact your account representative to inquire about this new offering. </p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td role="rowheader"><p>Adobe Workfront plan</p></td>
   <td>
<p>Any</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td role="rowheader"><p>Adobe Workfront license</p></td>
   <td>
   <p>Any</p> 
  </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
   <td role="rowheader">Access level</td>
   <td> <p>Any</p>  
</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
   <td role="rowheader">Layout template</td>
   <td> <p>Your system administrator must add the Maestro area in your layout template. For information, see <a href="../access/grant-access.md">Grant access to Adobe Maestro</a>. </p>  
</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<!--Maybe enable this at GA - but Maestro is not supposed to have Access controls in the Workfront Access Level: 
>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md). -->

<!-- Notes to add for the table: for the "Workfront plans" row: the above is only for closed beta; when going to GA - activate the following plans:    
<p>Current plan: Prime and Ultimate</p>
<p>Legacy plan: Enterprise</p>-->

<!-- Notes for the table: for the "Workfront access" row: <p>For more information, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md" class="MCXref xref">Adobe Workfront licenses overview</a>.</p>--> 

## Considerations about editing records

* You can edit records that you or another user created. <!--will change with access levels-->
* If the edited records are linked to other records, the new information of the records that you are editing reflects on the linked records. 
* You cannot edit records in bulk. <!--this will probably change-->

## Edit records

You can edit a record from the following areas:

* [From the Details page of a record](#edit-a-record-from-the-records-details-page)
* [From the table view of a record type](#edit-a-record-from-the-record-type-table-view) 

### Edit a record from the record's Details page

1. Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-workfront.png) in the upper-right corner, or the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-shell.png) in the upper-left corner, if it is available, then click Maestro. 

    The workspace that you access last opens. 
1. Do one of the following:

    * From a Table view, click the name of a record. 
    * From the Table view, hover over the name of a record, then click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png), then click **View**

        ![](assets/contextual-menu-for-record-row.png)
    * From a Timeline view, click a record bar. 

    The record **Details** page opens.

1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) to the right of the record name, then click **Edit**

    Or

    Click inside any editable field on the Details page to edit the information. 

    ![](assets/more-menu-options-from-record-details-page.png) <!--ensure the options have not changed or been renamed-->

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >    Linked fields or fields that contain calculations or are generated by the system are not editable.


1. Click **Save changes**. <!--logged a bug for this - this needs to be "Save"-->

### Edit a record from the record type table view

1. Click the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-workfront.png) in the upper-right corner, <!--or the **Main Menu** ![](assets/main-menu-shell.png) in the upper-left corner, if it is available,--> then click **Maestro** ![](assets/maestro-icon.png). 

    The workspace that you accessed last opens. 
1. Click a record type card. 

    The record type page opens. 
1. (Conditional) From the **View** drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the table, select a Table view. This should be the default view, unless you viewed the record type in the timeline view when you accessed it last. 

    The records associated with the selected record type display in the table view. 
1. Click inside the row of a record to start editing information about the record inline, then press **Enter** on your keyboard to save your changes. The changes are saved automatically.
