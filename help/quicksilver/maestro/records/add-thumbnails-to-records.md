## Considerations about record thumbnails

To visually distinguish between records in a table view,  you can associate a unique thumbnail image with each record. 

Consider the following: 

* You can add only image files as thumbnails.
* You can add a thumbnail image to individual records in the table view. 
* You cannot add record thumbnails from the record's Details page or in the timeline view. 
* The thumbnail image always displays to the left of the primary field of each record, regardless of what the field type is. 

   Fields that are single-line text, numbers, or formulas can be designated as primary fields. 
   For more information, see [Manage the table view](/help/quicksilver/maestro/views/manage-the-table-view.md). 

<!--above: when you know exactly what type of files are allowed, add the exact extensions above-->
