You can associate records with unique thumbnails in Adobe Workfront Planning, to make them easily recognizable. 

You must create record types before you can start creating and editing records. 
For information, see [Create record types](../architecture/create-record-types.md).

## Considerations about record thumbnails

To visually distinguish between records in a table view,  you can associate a unique thumbnail image with each record. 

Consider the following: 

* You can add only image files as thumbnails.
   <!--above: when you know exactly what type of files are allowed, add the exact extensions above-->
* You can add a thumbnail image to individual records in the table view. 
* Thumbnails belong to the record information and they display in views where records display. For example, thumbnails display alongside record information in the following areas:

   * The primary field of a record in the table view
   * The record bar in the timeline view. 
* You cannot add record thumbnails from the record's page or from another type of view. 
* Thumbnails do not display on the record's page.
