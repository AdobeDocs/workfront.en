## Share the Maestro area in the Main Menu with others

After your organization has been enrolled in the Maestro beta program, you can add the Maestro area to the Main Menu of all users by using a layout template.

1. Add the **Maestro** icon ![](assets/maestro-icon.png) to the **Main Menu** using a **Layout Template**. 
    
    For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

1. Assign the layout template to the users that you want to have access to Maestro. 

    For information, see [Assign users to a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md).

    All users assigned to the template can now access Maestro in their Main Menu. 
    
    Users can start creating workspaces, records types, records, and fields.

Users with any type of license can access Maestro.
