Adobe Maestro is a new offering from Adobe Workfront. For more information, see [Maestro overview](../maestro-overview.md). 

Currently, all users in your organization can have access to Maestro, if a Workfront administrator enables the access for them. 

>[!NOTE]

>There are no access levels or permissions associated with users or the information in Maestro. All users that have Maestro enabled in their environment can view, edit, and delete all the information any other user adds to Maestro.

>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level.

<p>Current plan: Prime and Ultimate</p>
<p>Legacy plan: Enterprise</p>-->
