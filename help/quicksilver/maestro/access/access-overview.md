<!--update the metadata with real things when making this public; also update the description with something like this: Not all users in the organization have the same access and permissions to use Adobe Maestro. This article describes the levels of access that users could have to Adobe Maestro. -->
<!--update the title and the metadata title if Maestro is NOT its own product - because the title is too generic for it being a Workfront capability-->

## Share the Maestro area in the Main Menu with others

<!--First, contact your account manager to obtain access to the current Maestro closed beta program.--> 

After your organization has been enrolled in the Maestro beta program, you can add the Maestro area to the Main Menu of all users by using a layout template. 

1. Log in to **Workfront** as a Workfront administrator.  

1. Add the **Maestro** icon ![](assets/maestro-icon.png) to the **Main Menu** using a **Layout Template**. 
    
    For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

1. Assign the layout template to the users that you want to have access to Maestro. 

    For information, see [Assign users to a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md).

    All users assigned to the template can now access Maestro in their Main Menu. 
    
    Users can start creating workspaces, records types, records, and fields.

## Grant access 

There are no access controls for Maestro. 

Users with any type of license can access Maestro. 

## Grant permissions

You must give users who are not System Administrators permissions to workspaces and views you create in order for them to access them.
