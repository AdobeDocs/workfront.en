## Sharing permissions

There are no permissions associated with Maestro objects. 

All users that have Maestro enabled in their environment can view, edit, and delete all the information any other user adds to Maestro. 

<!--
Replace the Sharing permissions information with this, when we release permissions: 

All users can have access to the Maestro area in the Main Menu. However, only Workfront administrators can create Maestro objects. Users with any other license type can access Maestro workspaces and their information only when workspaces are shared with them. 

Consider the following when sharing permissions to Maestro: 

* You can share only workspaces in Maestro. After a Workfront administrator shares a workspace with you, you can view record types, records, and fields in the workspace. 
* All Workfront administrators have access to edit or delete existing workspaces, even when they are created by other users. 

For information about sharing the Maestro area with users or sharing permissions to Maestro workspaces, see the following articles:

   * [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Maestro](../access/sharing-permissions-overview.md)
   * [Grant access to Adobe Maestro](../access/grant-access.md) -->
