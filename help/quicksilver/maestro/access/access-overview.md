## Sharing permissions

There are no permissions associated with Maestro objects. 

All users that have Maestro enabled in their environment can view, edit, and delete all the information any other user adds to Maestro. 

<!--
Replace the Sharing permissions information above with this, when we release permissions: 

You can share the following objects in Adobe Workfront Maestro:

* Workspaces
* Views

You can create Maestro workspaces, record types, records, fields, and views when the Workfront administrator makes the Maestro area available in your Main Menu through your layout template. 

Consider the following when sharing permissions to Maestro objects: 

* You can share only workspaces and views in Maestro. After someone shares a workspace with you, you can view record types, records, and fields in the workspace. 
(***********CHECK THIS: * Sharing a workspace does not share record views. You must share the views separately from the record type page.*************** )
* All users can create workspaces in Maestro. 
* All Workfront administrators have access to edit or delete existing workspaces and views, even when they are created by other users. 
* All other users that are not System Administrators can only view and manage workspaces and views that they create or workspaces and views that they have Manage permissions to. 

For information about sharing the Maestro area with users or sharing permissions to Maestro workspaces, see the following articles:

   * [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Maestro](../access/sharing-permissions-overview.md)
   * [Grant access to Adobe Maestro](../access/grant-access.md) -->
