# Share a view

You can share a view with others to ensure collaboration when working in Adobe Workfront Maestro. 

Granting permissions to a workspace does not give other users permissions to the views on the record type pages. You must grant permissions to individual views in a record type page to share them with other users. 

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

## Share permissions to a view

You can share views you created or views you have Manage permissions to.
