* As a system administrator, you must add the Maestro area to the Main Menu using a layout template. 

    Maestro does not display in the Main Menu by default for any user, including system administrators. 

    For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md). 

<!-- take out the note below when we release permissions-->

>[!NOTE]
>
>There are no access levels or permissions associated with users or the information in Maestro. All users that have Maestro enabled in their environment can view, edit, and delete all the information any other user adds to Maestro. 

## Share the Maestro area in the Main Menu with others

<!--First, contact your account manager to obtain access to the current Maestro closed beta program.--> 

After your organization has been enrolled in the Maestro beta program, you can add the Maestro area to the Main Menu of all users by using a layout template. 

1. Log in to **Workfront** as a Workfront administrator.  

1. Add the **Maestro** icon ![](assets/maestro-icon.png) to the **Main Menu** using a **Layout Template**.

    For information, see [Assign users to a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md).

    All users assigned to the template can now access Maestro in their Main Menu. 
    
    Users can start creating workspaces, records types, records, and fields.
