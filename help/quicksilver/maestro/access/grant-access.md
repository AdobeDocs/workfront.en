## Enable Maestro for the users in your Workfront instance

<!--First, contact your account manager to obtain access to the current Maestro closed beta program.--> 

After your organization has been enrolled in the Maestro beta program, you can add the Maestro area for other users by using a layout template. 

To share the Maestro area using a layout template: 

1. Log in to Workfront as a system administrator.  

1. Add the Maestro icon to the Main Menu using a Layout Template. 
    
    For information, see [Customize the Main Menu using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-main-menu.md).

1. Assign the  layout template to the users that you want to have access to Maestro. 

    For information, see [Assign users to a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/assign-users-to-layout-template.md).

    All users assigned to the template can now access Maestro in their Main Menu. 
    
    Users can start creating workspaces, records types, records, and fields.
