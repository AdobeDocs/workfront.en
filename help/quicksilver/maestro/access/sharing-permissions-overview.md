## Share a workspace

For information about sharing a Maestro workspace, see [Grant access to Adobe Maestro](../access/grant-access.md). 

## Remove permissions to a workspace

For information about sharing a Maestro workspace, see [Grant access to Adobe Maestro](../access/grant-access.md). 

<!--This is currently not possible: ## Request permissions to objects -->



<!--
Replace the Sharing permissions information above with this, when we release permissions: 

You can create Maestro workspaces, record types, records, fields, and views when the Workfront administrator makes the Maestro area available in your Main Menu through your layout template. 

You can share the following objects in Maestro:

* Workspaces

   When sharing workspaces, users also gain the same permissions to record types, records, and fields in the workspace. 
* Views



Consider the following when sharing permissions to Maestro objects: 

* You can share only workspaces and views in Maestro. After someone shares a workspace with you, you can view record types, records, and fields in the workspace. 
(***********CHECK THIS: * Sharing a workspace does not share record views. You must share the views separately from the record type page.*************** )
* All users can create workspaces in Maestro. 
* All Workfront administrators have access to edit or delete eisting workspaces and views, even the ones they did not create. 
* All other users that are not System Administrators can only view and manage workspaces and views that they create or workspaces and views that they have Manage permissions to. 

For information about sharing the Maestro area with users or sharing permissions to Maestro workspaces, see the following articles:

   * [Overview of sharing permissions in Adobe Maestro](../access/sharing-permissions-overview.md)
