<!--update the metadata with real things when making this public; also update the description with something like this: Not all users in the organization have the same access and permissions to use Adobe Maestro. This article describes the levels of access that users could have to Adobe Maestro. -->
<!--update the title and the metadata title if Maestro is NOT its own product - because the title is too generic for it being a Workfront capability-->

# License type overview when using the Adobe Workfront planning capabilities 

{{maestro-important-intro}}

Your Adobe Workfront license type works in conjunction with your Adobe Workfront planning capabilities permissions to give you access to view, contribute, or manage workspaces or views. <!--add more objects here when we can grant other object-specific permissions-->

This article describes the types of licenses needed and the access granted to objects based on each license type. 

A user with a lower-level license type has restricted permissions to objects when using Workfront planning capabilities. 

>[!INFO]
>
>**EXAMPLE:** Requestors (or Collaborators, according to the new license model) cannot contribute to or manage workspaces and their objects. 
>
>There is an indication in the sharing box that users cannot be granted permissions to contribute to or manage a workspace when they hold a lower-level license.
