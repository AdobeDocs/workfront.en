<!--update the metadata with real things when making this public; also update the description with something like this: Not all users in the organization have the same access and permissions to use Adobe Workfront plannint. This article describes the levels of access that users could have to Adobe Workfront Planning. -->
<!--update the title and the metadata title if Workfront Planning is NOT its own product - because the title is too generic for it being a Workfront capability-->

# License type overview when using Adobe Workfront Planning

{{maestro-important-intro}}

Your Adobe Workfront license type works in conjunction with your Adobe Workfront Planning permissions to give you access to view, contribute, or manage workspaces or views. <!--add more objects here when we can grant other object-specific permissions-->

This article describes the types of licenses needed and the access granted to objects based on each license type. 

A user with a lower-level license type has restricted permissions to objects when using Workfront Planning capabilities. 

>[!INFO]
>
>**EXAMPLE:** Requestors (or Collaborators, according to the new license model) cannot contribute to or manage workspaces and their objects. 
>
>There is an indication in the sharing box that users cannot be granted permissions to contribute to or manage a workspace when they hold a lower-level license.
