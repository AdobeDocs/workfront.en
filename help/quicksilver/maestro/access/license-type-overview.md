# License type overview in Adobe Maestro

{{maestro-important-intro}}

Your Adobe Workfront license type works in conjunction with your Maestro permissions to give you access to view, contribute, or manage Maestro objects.

This article describes the types of licenses needed and the access granted to Maestro objects based on each license type. 

A user with a lower-level license type has restricted permissions to Maestro objects. 

>[!INFO]
>
>**EXAMPLE:** Requestors (or Collaborators, according to the new license model) cannot contribute to or manage Maestro workspaces and their objects. 
>
>There is an indication in the sharing box that users cannot be granted permissions to contribute to or manage a workspace when they hold a lower-level license.
