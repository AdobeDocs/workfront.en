# Create workspaces

In Adobe Maestro, workspaces are centralized locations for teams to plan work. 

A workspace is a collection of operational record types and taxonomies used by a team and represents the team's work lifecycle.

## Considerations about workspaces

* You can create workspaces for specific organizational units within your organization, to match the unique way each unit works. 
* The record types and taxonomies that a workspace contains should reflect the work lifecycle of an organizational unit. 
* When you create a workspace, everyone in your organization can view, edit, or delete it.  <!--this will change with access levels and permissions-->
* You can have a maximum of 1,000 workspaces in your organization.
