In Adobe Maestro, workspaces are centralized locations for teams to plan work. For more information, see [Create workspaces](../architecture/delete-workspaces.md). 

You can delete workspaces that are no longer relevant. 

We recommend recreating some or all of the record types and taxonomies associated with the workspace that you want to delete in another workspace before deleting it.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article: 

<table style="table-layout:auto">

<!--Maybe enable this at GA - but Maestro is not supposed to have Access controls in the Workfront Access Level: 
>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md). -->

<!-- Notes to add for the table: for the "Workfront plans" row: the above is only for closed beta; when going to GA - activate the following plans:    
<p>Current plan: Prime and Ultimate</p>
<p>Legacy plan: Enterprise</p>-->

## Considerations about deleting workspaces

* You can delete any workspace that either you or anyone in your organization has created. <!--this will change with access levels and permissions-->
* When you delete workspaces, all the record types, taxonomies, and their fields are also deleted. <!--asked Lilit because the confirmation says the records don't delete, but not sure how they can exist outside of a workspace?!-->
* Deleted workspaces and the information they contain cannot be recovered. 

## Delete a workspace

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-workfront.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, or the **Main menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-shell.png)  in the upper-left corner, if available, then click **Maestro** ![](assets/maestro-icon.png).

    This opens the last workspace you accessed. 

1. (Optional) Expand the downward-pointing arrow to the right of an existing workspace name and select the workspace that you want to delete. 
1. Click the **More** menu ![](assets/more-menu.png) next to the workspace name, then click **Delete**.
1. Click **Delete** to confirm.

    The workspace is deleted and cannot be recovered. Any record types, taxonomies, their records, and the fields associated with them are also deleted. <!--ensure this is right after closed beta-->
