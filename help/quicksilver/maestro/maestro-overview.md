## Maestro concepts

The following table describes the Maestro objects and concepts:

| Concept |Description |
|---|---|
| Workspace |A collection of record types and taxonomies. |
| Record Type | The Maestro main object. In Maestro, you can create your own object types. For example, in Workfront the object types of Program, Portfolio, Project, Task, or Issue are already created. In Maestro you can create any object types that meet your organization's workflows. |
| Operational Record Type |A kind of Record Type that represents work objects. For example, Campaign, Activity, Tactic can be operational record types.|
| Taxonomy | A reusable kind of Record Type that that captures attributes about an operational record type. For example, Audience, Region, or Address can be taxonomies. |
| Record | An instance of a Maestro record type. For example, Campaign can be an Operational Record Type. Summer Campaign for EMEA is a record of the type Campaign. | 

Workspaces and record types are fully customizable and you can create as many as needed.
