# Code Samples

## PHP

The attached&nbsp;file "PHP.proofhq.uploader.two.scripts.with.callbacks.zip" contains&nbsp;a number of pages that demonstrates how a proof or file can be uploaded into the Workfront Proof system using PHP code. Additionally, they perform Callback actions when creating the proof.

The sample can be viewed by loading either the "proofhq.proofs.uploader.html" or "proofhq.files.uploader.html" in a web browser.

## .NET

The attached&nbsp;file "dot.NET.proofhq.login.and.get.sessionID.rar&nbsp;" contains&nbsp;a sample of how to log in to Workfront Proof system and see session ID using .NET code.&nbsp;

Please note that&nbsp;reference to our API must be added as Web Reference instead of Service Reference, as shown in attached screencast "dot.NET.reference.swf".&nbsp;

Result of incorrect reference can be:

```
"The top XML element 'result' from namespace '' references distinct types System.Boolean and ApprovalHQ.SOAPWorkflowTemplateObject. Use XML attributes to specify another XML name or namespace for the element or types."
```
