[!DNL Adobe Workfront Campaigns] offer a new way to manage your work. As a new object in Workfront, a campaign enables you to organize projects from different portfolios and programs in a new work container that will evolve and which will eventually include all work objects that you are currently managing in separate silos.

We are excited to open the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area for public beta. This program started with the 22.3 release.

The new [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area is currently under development.

For general information about campaigns, see [Campaigns overview](../../manage-work/campaigns/campaigns-overview.md).

## Release schedule

Currently, the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area is accessible only in the Preview environment and it is in the beta phase. The official dates for the Production beta release as well as for the final launch are to be determined. 

* Public beta launch:
  * Preview beta launch: June 2022
  * Production beta launch: To be determined   
  * Beta completion: To be determined
* Final official release: To be determined

The following features will release as part of a tiered product release plan. Features that you can access in this beta may not be available in the full release, based on your organization's plan or the input we receive during the beta phase.

## Beta FAQs

**Question**: How do I know if my organization has joined the beta?

**Answer**: When your system or group administrator enabled the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area for you, you can access it from the Main Menu.


 **Question**: Can I opt out of the beta?

**Answer**: As a system or group administrator, you can opt out of the beta or remove the beta access from other users by removing the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area from the layout template. If you are a regular user and you do not want to see the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] area in your [!UICONTROL Main Menu], talk to your system or group administrator to remove it from your layout template.


**Question**: I cannot edit or delete a campaign, although I am able to access it.

**Answer**: Ensure you are the [!UICONTROL Campaign Owner] or a system administrator. You can edit or delete campaigns only when you are the system administrator or when you are the owner of a campaign.
