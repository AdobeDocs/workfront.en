# New commenting experience

<span class="preview">The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview environment.</span>

An update to the commenting experience in Adobe Workfront is currently in development. This update includes a new interface, new features, and improved performance in the Updates section of select objects. 

The new commenting experience will slowly become available for all the objects with an Updates section in Workfront, and later it will expand to other Adobe Experience Cloud applications.

## Features

The new commenting experience includes improvements and changes to the existing update stream.

<!-- Previous content here - replaced with the table below: 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The Unified Commenting Experience features listed below are currently only available in Adobe Workfront Goals.

* **Creating comments**

    You can create a new comment, format it with rich text, and tag others to be notified. For more information on creating comments, see [Manage goal comments](/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md).

* **Responding to comments**

    You can react to a comment with a like or reply with a new comment in-thread that can notify the original commenter and owner of the object.

* **System Activity**
    
    System-generated updates for an object are now listed seperately from comments made in the update tab. For more information on viewing the System Activity stream, see step 11 of [Manage goal comments](/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/goal-management/manage-goal-comments.md).

--> 

Among the improvements included in the new commenting experience are the following:

* Improved performance and user experience
* Separation of user comments from the system activity updates.
* Real-time indicator when new comments are added to an object
* Editing comments after submitting them. 

The following features have been removed from the new experience:

* Comment on a system update. 

The following table illustrates the features that will be available in the new commenting experience as well as their availability in areas where they are supported:
