<!--An update to the commenting experience in Adobe Workfront is currently in development. This update includes a new interface, new features, and improved performance in the Updates section of select objects. 

The new commenting experience will slowly become available for all the objects with an Updates section in Workfront, and later it will expand to other Adobe Experience Cloud applications.-->

<!--For additional resources for the new commenting experience, also see the following articles:

* [New commenting experience release activity](../new-commenting-experience-beta/new-commenting-beta-experience-release-activity.md)

## Features

The new commenting experience includes improvements and changes to the Updates section of Adobe Workfront objects. 

Among the improvements included in the new commenting experience are the following:

* Improved performance and user experience
* Separation of user comments from the system activity updates
* Real-time indicator when new comments are added to an object
* Editing comments after submitting them

The following features have been removed from the new experience:

* Comment on a system update
* Ability to edit status, condition, commit date while commenting
* Edit custom form
* The "on behalf of < user name >" information when a Workfront or group administrator logs in as another user and adds a comment on their behalf was originally removed. It has been reinstated on October 19, 2023.
* The "Ask for approval" option when you tag people while adding a comment to a document. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The objects listed below have only the comments and system updates starting with January 1, 2019 available in the new commenting experience.  
>
>You can view comments and system updates on these objects prior to January 1, 2019 when viewing the Updates section in the current experience:
>
>* Issues
>* Projects
>* Tasks
>* Documents
