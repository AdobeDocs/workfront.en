# New commenting experience FAQs

This article contains a list of the most commonly-asked questions about the new commenting experience. 

For more information about the new commenting experience, see [New commenting experience](../../betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md).

## Can I attach different file types in addition to images to comments? 

Currently we support only image attachments to comments. If you would like to see other file types, please submit an innovation lab request so that we can understand how required the feature is. 

## Will you add back the ability to edit the Status, Condition, or Planned Completion Date of a work item in the new commenting experience? 

We don't plan on bringing back the ability to perform these actions, since those are available from the header and the object's Details areas. We do understand that we are asking you to change the pattern of using the commenting stream, but we are doing this to keep the commenting experience for its direct purpose of communication and collaboration. 

## Are there plans to have a combined view of comments and system updates? 

There are currently no plans to provide a combined view. Please provide your feedback and use cases via the in-app Leave feedback button or submit requests in the Workfront Ideas area of the Community so that we can better understand how required the functionality is. 

## Will you bring back the functionality of undoing a posted comment?

We have replaced the functionality of undoing a posted comment with the ability to edit comments for 15 minutes from the moment it was posted. 

## Will the functionality of removing thread participants be limited to specific license types? 

There are currently no plans to add permission or access controls for who can use this newly introduced functionality. Please provide your feedback and use cases via the in-app Leave feedback button or submit requests in the Workfront Ideas area of the Community so that we can better understand how important this functionality is. 

## Is there a way to control who can edit comments? 

There are currently no plans to add permission or access controls over who can edit comments. Please provide your feedback and use cases via the in-app Leave feedback button or submit requests in the Workfront Ideas area of the Community so that we can better understand how important this functionality is.

## Will it be possible to search or filter comments? 

Yes. We are planning to introduce the ability to search for comments in the future. 

## Will it be possible to sort comments? 

There are no firm plans to introduce this. If there is still need for it after we introduce searching and filtering, we will reconsider our plans.
