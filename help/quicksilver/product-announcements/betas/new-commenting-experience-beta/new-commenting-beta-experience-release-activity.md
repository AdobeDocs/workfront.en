## New commenting experience location and release timeline

The new commenting experience brings a new design to the Updates section of Workfront objects. 

For information about which Workfront objects display the Updates section, see [Updates section overview](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md).

For information about the release timeline for the new commenting experience, see [New commenting experience](../../betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md). 


## Features released during the beta period

The features documented in this section are now available to all customers and in all environments. 

The following features were added to the commenting experience during the beta phase, between the 23.2 release (April 6, 2023) and the Fourth Quarter 2023 release (October 26, 2023). 

The following information refers to the release activity on a weekly basis, starting with the most recent update. 

### Week of October 16, 2023

#### Add the "on behalf of < user name >" information when commenting while logged in as another user

While redesigning the commenting experience, we had removed the "on behalf of < user name >" indicator when a Workfront or group administrator added comments while logged in as another user. This information has now been restored. 

Preview and production for all customers: October 19, 2023. 

### Week of September 11, 2023

#### The new commenting experience captures information starting with January 1, 2019

>[!NOTE]
>
>This limitation was removed after November 28, 2023. For more information, see [First Quarter 2024 release overview](../../product-releases/24-q1-release-activity/24-q1-release-overview.md). 


Projects, tasks, issues, and documents display updates starting with January 1, 2019 now. Prior to this enhancement, the new commenting experience captured only updates from June 2022 for these objects.  

For more information, see [New commenting experience](../new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md). 

Preview and production for all customers: September 11, 2023. 

### Week of August 21, 2023

#### Change timestamp format on the Comments tab

We have updated the timestamp format of the user comments in the Comments tab of the new commenting stream. As part of this change, comments from the current year no longer display the year in the timestamp. Hovering over a timestamp displays the full date, including the year.  

The changes do not affect system updates in the System Activity tab. 

Preview and production for all customers: August 24, 2023

### Week of August 14, 2023

#### New commenting experience for additional objects 

<!--
[!BADGE In production for Fast Release ]{type=Positive}
-->

The new commenting experience will be available for the following objects, shortly after the 23.3 release to Production: template tasks, templates, timesheets, teams, users, programs, portfolios.  

This will be the only commenting experience for these objects, as the legacy commenting experience is removed when you access them.  

For more information, see [New commenting experience](../../../product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md). 

Preview release: August 17, 2023

Production release for fast release: With the 23.8 release (August 31, 2023)

Production release for all customers: With the 23.10 release (October, 2023)

#### New design update for the new commenting stream 

<!--
[!BADGE In production for Fast Release ]{type=Positive}
-->

We have redesigned the new commenting stream to give it a more updated look-and-feel. Some of the improvements are:  

* The content of the commenting stream is centered on the page, rather that occupying the entire width of the page.   

* The More menu icon is relocated to the top right corner of the comment, rather than next to the Like button.  

* The Like and Reply buttons are now positioned next to each other.  

* The Log Time button has been relocated in the upper-right corner of the commenting area.  

* The Add reply prompt was added to prompt users to add a reply to an existing one.   

* There is a separation line between each comment thread

[!BADGE In production for Fast Release ]{type=Positive}
-->

We are making the new commenting experience the default experience for the following objects: projects, tasks, issues, and documents.  The legacy commenting experience will remain as an alternative option when accessing these objects.  

To support this change, we also renamed the "Commenting Beta" toggle to "New commenting".

For more information, see [Tag others in updates](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md).
