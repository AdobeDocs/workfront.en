## Release timeline

We are planning to release the new commenting experience iteratively. This will impact select objects with each release. A small set of features might be released in the beginning and more features will be added to the remaining objects over time.

For information about which Workfront objects display the Updates section, see   [Updates section overview](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md).

The following is a planned timeline with key milestones for the release of the new commenting experience to the Production environment. In addition to the milestones below, we will continue to improve the commenting experience with smaller enhancements. For details about all the released features, see the [Released features](#released-features) section in this article.

## Released features

The following section contains a list of features that have been added after the original 23.2 release, starting with the ones released most recently. 

The following information refers to the release activity on a weekly basis of the features included in the new commenting beta experience. This article lists new features that are added and issues that are resolved for the new commenting experience.

### Week of August 21, 2023

#### Change timestamp format on the Comments tab

We have updated the timestamp format of the user comments in the Comments tab of the new commenting stream. As part of this change, comments from the current year no longer display the year in the timestamp. Hovering over a timestamp displays the full date, including the year.  

The changes do not affect system updates in the System Activity tab. 

Preview and production: August 24, 2023

### Week of August 14, 2023 

[View a video demonstration of all the features released during the week of August 14, 2023](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3422912/){target=_blank}

#### New commenting experience for additional objects 

The new commenting experience will be available for the following objects, shortly after the 23.3 release to Production: template tasks, templates, timesheets, teams, users, programs, portfolios.  

This will be the only commenting experience for these objects, as the legacy commenting experience is removed when you access them.  

For more information, see [New commenting experience](../../../product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md).

Production release for all customers: With the 23.10 release (October, 2023)

#### New design update for the new commenting stream 

We have redesigned the new commenting stream to give it a more updated look-and-feel. Some of the improvements are:  

* The content of the commenting stream is centered on the page, rather that occupying the entire width of the page.   

* The More menu icon is relocated to the top right corner of the comment, rather than next to the Like button.  

* The Like and Reply buttons are now positioned next to each other.  

* The Log Time button has been relocated in the upper-right corner of the commenting area.  

* The Add reply prompt was added to prompt users to add a reply to an existing one.   

* There is a separation line between each comment thread
