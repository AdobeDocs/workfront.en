For information, see [23.3 release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

### New look and feel of the "edited" tag after editing a comment 

When editing a comment in the new commenting Beta experience, an "edited" tag is added to the comment. This tag now has a new look and feel from the one originally released. The date and time stamps of the comment are those of the original comment. They are not the date and time stamps of when the edit was made.

When enabling the commenting Beta experience, the comments associated with a child object now roll up to the parent object. For example, comments from documents now display on the issue where the documents are attached.

## Week of May 1, 2023

### Images are removed from the Documents area when attachments are removed from comments or when comments containing an attachment are removed

We are changing the way attachments work when removing or editing a comment that contains an attachment.

Prior to this change, in the previous commenting experience, the attachments remained in your Documents area. For information, see [Update work](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).
