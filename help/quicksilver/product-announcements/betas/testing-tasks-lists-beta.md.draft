# Testing task list beta

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: Alina: Keep this in draft - Anna might use it again in the near future - May 11, 2017)</p>

Some information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available in the Preview Sandbox environment, only by request.&nbsp;

## The task list testing beta program {#the-task-list-testing-beta-program}

We are currently working on improving the performance around lists in Workfront. We have already implemented new functionality that improves the performance around a list of dashboards. We are&nbsp;now extending this functionality to a list of tasks.&nbsp;

This feature focuses primarily on improving the performance of large lists of tasks. The interface of tasks lists has been updated, but delivers the same functionality as the existing tasks list.&nbsp;

Right now, the new functionality around tasks lists is only available in the Preview Sandbox, and it is visible only to customers who specifically request it. We have opened a beta testing window for gathering feedback from you about working with tasks in a task list.&nbsp;

If you would like to be part of this beta program and have this functionality enabled in your Preview Sandbox, see [Sign up for the task list beta program](#sign-up-for-the-task-list-beta-program).

When you volunteer to sign up for the beta program to test the new tasks list functionality, please keep in mind the list of actions we would like you to focus on as you are testing this feature. For more information about the actions we are targeting with this research, see&nbsp; [The task list testing beta program](#the-task-list-testing-beta-program).

## Test the task lists

When you sign up for the&nbsp;beta testing program for tasks lists, we ask that you test the following features with a list of tasks larger than 1000 items:

Make the following modifications in the tasks list:

* Inline edit tasks.&nbsp;
* Add new tasks and subtasks. For more information about adding subtasks, see [Create subtasks](../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-subtasks.md).
* Drag and drop the parent task in various&nbsp;positions.
* Change predecessors in in-line edit.
* Change dates on the tasks in in-line edit.
* Any other actions you would usually perform on your tasks inside the project tasks list.

For more information about in-line editing, see [Inline edit items in a list in Adobe Workfront](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/inline-edit-objects.md).

## Send feedback about the task list beta program

Perform the actions described above, with the following questions in mind:

* Have you noticed any functionality changes that concern you while performing those actions?
* Do you like the new changes to the tasks list?
* Was it faster to work with the tasks list than before?

After testing various functions in the tasks list, as described&nbsp;above,&nbsp;fill out the [Beta Testing Results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmoMXos_o88dAdTEfb_pvCS43S8Zt2LY_fxMW2VJdAyszsLQ/viewform) survey to send your feedback to our Product Management team.&nbsp;
