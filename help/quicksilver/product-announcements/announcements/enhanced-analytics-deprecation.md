# Enhanced Analytics deprecation guide

Due to declining use and limited functionality, Enhanced Analytics will soon be deprecated from Adobe Workfront. We have released Workfront Data Connect as an alternative that can replicate the Enhanced Analytics visualizations you currently use, in addition to creating powerful new visualizations that were not possible with Enhanced Analytics. To ensure a successful transition for your organization, this page contains information about what exactly will change, advice on how to prepare for the transition, and answers to frequently asked questions.

## Deprecation information

**What will change?**

* Enhanced Analytics will no longer be available.

**When?**

* The week of May 26th

**What can I use instead?**

* Workfront Data Connect can replicate Enhanced Analytics visualizations. See [Replicate Enhanced Analytics visualizations in Workfront Data Connect](#replicate-enhanced-analytics-visualizations-in-workfront-data-connect) below for more information.

## Prepare for the deprecation

To minimize disruption for you and your organization, we've provided recommendations below that will ease the transition from Enhanced Analytics to Workfront Data Connect.

### Begin using Workfront Data Connect

Our first recommendation is to ensure your organization has access to Workfront Data Connect and to familiarize yourself with its use as soon as possible. To learn more about Data Connect capabilities and how to begin using it, see [Workfront Data Connect overview](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/data-lake/data-lake-overview.md).

Data Connect is included in the new Ultimate plan<!--, and can be purchased as an add-on to the new Select and Prime plans-->. Note that Data Connect is not available for organizations on legacy Workfront plans. Contact your Workfront account representative to find out what plan your organization is currently on and how to purchase Data Connect.

### Replicate Enhanced Analytics visualizations

You can use Workfront Data Connect to replicate the Enhanced Analytics visualizations that you find most valuable in addition to many new visualization options. As we get closer to the deprecation, we will add specific examples of queries that replicate Enhanced Analytics visualizations to the [Workfront Data Connect example queries](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/data-lake/basic-query-examples.md) page.

### Ask for help

If you encounter issues during the transition, please contact your account representative or the support team for assistance.
