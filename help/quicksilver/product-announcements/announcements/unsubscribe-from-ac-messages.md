# Unsubscribe from Announcement Center Messagesin the new Adobe Workfront experience

Announcement Center messages are messages that are sent from Adobe Workfront to the Workfront customer base. You can unsubscribe from the following types of Announcement Center messages:

* Announcements regarding functionality that is released on a feature-by-feature basis outside of these major releases.

  Most new functionality introduced in the Workfront platform is released in conjunction with one of the 4 major releases each year. However, some functionality is released on a feature-by-feature basis outside of these major releases. Each time a feature is released outside of a major release, you receive a message via the Announcement Center. (For more information about the Announcement Center, see [Send announcements](../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/view-send-announcements.md).)

* Announcements regarding upcoming Training offerings and events.
