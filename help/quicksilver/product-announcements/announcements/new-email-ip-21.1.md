# New IP addresses for Adobe Workfront email with the 21.1 release

In an effort to increase successful email delivery, we're adding new IP addresses with the 21.1 Production release for the clusters listed below. To find out which cluster you're instance is on, go to Setup > System > Customer Info.

**Clusters 1,2,3, and 5**

Add the following IP addresses to your allowlist to ensure your users continue to receive their email:

* 23.251.237.107
* 23.251.237.108
* 23.251.237.109
* 23.251.237.106

**Cluster 4**

Add the following IP addresses to your allowlist to ensure your users continue to receive their email:

* 23.251.239.98
* 23.251.239.99

(For additional context about the allowlist and other IP addresses that might already be added to your allowlist, see [Configure your firewall's allowlist](../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-firewall.md).)

When does this need to be done?

This change must be completed before February 2021.

What can my organization expect if we do not make this change?

Your users may not receive all Workfront-generated emails.
