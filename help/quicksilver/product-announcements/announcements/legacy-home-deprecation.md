# Legacy Home deprecation guide

Adobe Workfront community, we have news—we will soon be deprecating legacy Home. By legacy Home, we are referring to the worklist page below:

![](assets/legacy-home-worklist-view.png)
 
This page will be deprecated during the 24.10 release (planned for October 17, 2024). At that time, you will be required to move to the new Home experience. If you've been using legacy Home to manage your work, don't worry! In addition to continually improving new Home, we've been busy building a streamlined work management experience called Priorities. 
Still, we know a change like this can be disruptive, and we want to help with your transition in any way we can. This page contains information about what exactly will change, advice on how to prepare for the transition, and some answers to frequently asked questions.

## Deprecation information

**What will change?**

* Legacy Home (Worklist page) will be retired as we have created an improved experience.

**When?**

* As part of the 24.10 release (planned October 17, 2024)

**What can I use instead?**

* New Home is already available as a replacement. See [Get started with the new Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/get-started-with-home.md) for more information about using new Home. It can be customized by both users through personalization options and administrators through layout templates. 

* Priorities is in development and will serve as another element of the streamlined work management experience in Adobe Workfront.

## Prepare for the deprecation

To help minimize disruption for you and your organization, below are some recommendations that will help ease the transition.

### Begin the transition to new Home

Our primary recommendation is to begin transitioning to new Home as soon as possible. Organizationally, this means your administrator customizing users' experiences through layout templates—similarly to legacy Home—to make sure each user has what they need. 

We recommend administrators:

1. Build a default new Home page layout using layout templates (or, optionally, create one for each user, team, group, or job role that requires a unique layout.) See [Customize new Home using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-new-home-layout-template.md) for more information.

1. Assign your new layout templates to a small number of test users, who can verify that their widgets and general settings meet their work needs.

1. Reassign the rest of your users to the new Home page layout.

Doing this as soon as possible will then give your users time to adjust to the new experience and customize their new Home pages to best suit their individual needs. See [Remove, add, and rearrange widgets in new Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/add-edit-remove-widgets-in-new-home.md) for information on how a user can customize the widgets on their own new Home page.

### Learn what is available in new Home and Priorities

This articles below provide information on what functionality is available in new Home and Priorities:

<!--* [Move from Legacy Home to New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/move-to-new-home.md)-->
* [Move from Legacy Home to Priorities](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/priorities/move-from-legacy-home-to-priorities.md)

### Follow the Home experience as it develops

We also recommend keeping up to date with the latest release notes (see [Product releases](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md)) to learn about any changes made to the Home experience as we get closer to the deprecation. Additionally, continue reading about Priorities to better understand our vision for the future of work management in Adobe Workfront (more information coming soon.)

### Ask for help

If you encounter issues during the transition, please contact your Account Executive/Support team for assistance.

## FAQ

+++ Will I be able to continue using legacy Home after the deprecation?

No, it will be completely removed from the application.

Nearly, with the exception of:

* Calendar, which is currently on our roadmap for Priorities.

* Displaying time stamps for object due dates is not currently available.

* Displaying the commit date within the update feed is not currently available. However, there is an available workaround: display the commit date in the header through layout template customization.

+++How do I regulate which widgets users have access to in new Home?

Administrators can set specific default widgets for users/teams/groups/job roles, set default states, and choose which options are available for individual user customization, all through layout templates. See [Customize new Home using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-new-home-layout-template.md) for more information.
+++

+++How do I check what my current legacy Home settings are so that I can replicate them in new Home?

See [Customize Home and Summary using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-home-summary-layout-template.md) for instructions on finding your current legacy Home settings.
+++

+++Does new Home support custom fields?

Custom fields can be viewed in new Home by:

* Having an administrator use layout templates to customize the side summary panel, which will then be reflected in the My Work widget summary panel. See [Customize Home and Summary using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-home-summary-layout-template.md) for more information.

* Having an administrator use layout templates to add a custom field columns to the My Tasks or My Issues widgets. See [Customize new Home using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-new-home-layout-template.md) for more information.
+++

+++Can I submit feedback?

Yes! Please do so by clicking the in-app **Give Feedback** button on your new Home page, through the upcoming Priorities page, or through the [Workfront Ideas forum](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/workfront-ideas/idb-p/workfront-ideas).
