# Maintenance Window FAQ

## What is an Adobe Workfront maintenance window?

Maintenance windows are blocks of time reserved for Workfront to make updates to infrastructure and other platform-related issues. Occasionally Sandbox environments are included in the maintenance.

Workfront is committed to minimizing disruption as much as possible. If maintenance is required, it is scheduled and announced on the Workfront Status site at [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).

## When are the Workfront maintenance windows?

Maintenance windows are normally scheduled in advance over weekends between 8PM Mountain Time on Fridays and 12 Noon Mountain Time on Sundays. 

## Can I be notified prior to a scheduled maintenance?

You can receive advanced notification of planned maintenance by subscribing to the Workfront Status site ([status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).) The Workfront Status site announces maintenance at least 3 days prior to the event. If there is an emergency situation, the advance notice might be less.

For information about how to receive status updates to maintenance and trending issues, see [Subscribe or Manage your subscription](../../workfront-basics/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/understand-the-status-site.md#managing-your-subscription) in the article [The Adobe Workfront Status site](../../workfront-basics/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/understand-the-status-site.md).
