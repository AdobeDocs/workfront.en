# Change required for adding proofs to your allowlist

The proofing domain is changing from&nbsp;proofhq.com to workfront.com.

If your firewall or mail server is configured to allow access only to specific vendors, you must add the following additional URL&nbsp;to your allowlist to ensure that users in your organization can view proofs within Adobe Workfront in both the browser proofing viewer and the desktop proofing viewer:

&#42;.workfront.com

The &#42;proofhq.com URL is also still required.

For more information about updating your allowlist, see [Configure your firewall's allowlist](../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-firewall.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This update applies only to proofing within Workfront; it does not apply when using the Workfront Proof stand-alone application.
