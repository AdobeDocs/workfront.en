# Fourth Quarter 2024 integration enhancements

This page describes all integration enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q4-release-activity/24-q4-release-overview.md).

## Outlook integration login experience enhancements

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: August 6, 2024; Production release: August 6, 2024

The login experience for Outlook integration has been streamlined so that all customers see the same button to log in to Workfront whether or not they are IMS-enabled. The subsequent login steps remain different for IMS and non-IMS instances, but the initial page is the same for all users.

For information, see [Set up Adobe Workfront for Outlook](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-outlook/set-up-workfront-for-outlook.md).
