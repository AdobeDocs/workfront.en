We've made the following Changes to the Awaiting my approval widget:

## Simplify the Workfront experience for task owners with Priorities

Introducing Priorities: a simpler, streamlined, and more intuitive Workfront experience for task owners.

Priorities enhances focus and productivity to help customers accomplish more in less time. 

With Priorities, you can enjoy

* Manage and prioritize daily tasks: Organize your day or week with consolidated navigation for better clarity
* Greater productivity: Access project context and perform tasks quicker with fewer clicks
* Personalized features: Benefit from features uniquely designed for task owners

Priorities is intended to replace Legacy Home and new functionality will release in phases.

## Deprecation of the legacy Home experience with 24.10

We will be officially deprecating the legacy Home experience with the 24.10 release. 

With this change, the following areas will be impacted:

**Layout Template**

* The _Home workspace_ area will be renamed to _Home_. 
* The _Home and Summary_ area will be renamed to _Summary panel_. Customizations in this area will still apply to the Summary panel in new Home. For more information, see [Customize Home and Summary using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-home-summary-layout-template.md).

**Manage approvals**

* You will no longer be able to recall, remind, or remove users from submitted approvals in the Home area. Instead, you can manage this on the approval itself. 

Users are encouraged to begin using new Home, which will continue to be enhanced with additional features prior to the deprecation. For more information about the transition, including advice about what users and administrators can do to prepare, see [Legacy Home deprecation guide](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/announcements/legacy-home-deprecation.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>After Legacy home is deprecated, _new Home_ will be referred to as _Home_ in Workfront. All _new Home_ documentation will be renamed to _Home_.
