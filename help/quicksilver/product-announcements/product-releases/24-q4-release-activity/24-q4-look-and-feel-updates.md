# Look-and-feel updates during the Fourth Quarter 2024 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the Fourth Quarter 2024 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the Fourth Quarter 2024 release, see [Fourth Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q4-release-activity/24-q4-release-overview.md).

## Look and feel updates for reports

>[!NOTE]
>
>Production release for all customers: Incrementally beginning with the 24.10 release (October 17, 2024), full availability by November 8, 2024

We have made a variety of updates to the report interface to match the design of other areas of Workfront. These updates include some additional changes to various reporting features, including:

* An expanded color palette has been added for conditional formatting rules in reports. For more information about conditional formatting, see [Use conditional formatting in views](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/use-conditional-formatting-views.md).
* A new "Edit Text Mode" button has been added to enter text mode when editing a column in the report builder. For more information about editing report views in text mode, see [Edit a view using text mode](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/edit-text-mode-in-view.md)
* A new toggle has been added to the report filter interface to switch between a calendar date selector and a relative date wildcard text field when filtering by a date field. Additionally, selecting a relative date wildcard shortcut in the report filter interface now automatically populates the associated wildcard fields based on your selection. For more information about using relative date wildcards in report filters, see [Use date-based wildcards to generalize reports](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/use-date-based-wildcards-generalize-reports.md).
* User-based wildcards in report filters now suggest relevant wildcards for auto-complete based on your selected field type. For more information on user-based wildcards in report filters, see [Use user-based wildcards to generalize reports](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/use-user-based-wildcards-generalize-reports.md).
* Reports with prompts that are shared publicly will now be displayed without prompts applied for all users accessing it through the public share link. Logged in users that access the report directly will still be able to apply prompts. For information about report prompts, see [Add a prompt to a report](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/add-prompt-report.md).
* Changes to existing reports that improve their compatibility with Canvas Dashboards.
