To make it easier for you to accomplish your work, we've added Adobe's AI Assistant to Workfront. AI Assistant can help you by:

* Summarizing work items and documents, allowing you to quickly gain a general understanding of tasks, projects, and assets.
* Providing information from Experience League documentation, bringing instructions and reference material into Workfront, while linking to more in-depth documentation.
* Creating and refining formulas for calculated custom form fields, generating formulas from text prompts, or locating errors in existing formulas.

Your Workfront administrator can enable or disable AI Assistant for your organization. The AI Assistant is available for instances with Select, Prime, and Ultimate plans.
