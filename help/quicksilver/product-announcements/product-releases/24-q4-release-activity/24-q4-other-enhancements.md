>Preview release: October 3, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.10 release (October 17, 2024)

To make it easier to quickly see highlights of a project or an update stream, we've added Summarize buttons to those areas of Workfront. Now, you can click the button to generate a summary in the AI Assistant.

Previously users could open AI Assistant and type in a prompt to create a summary of the project or update stream.

Your Workfront administrator can enable or disable AI Assistant for your organization. The AI Assistant is available for instances with Select, Prime, and Ultimate plans.

To make it easier for you to accomplish your work, we've added Adobe's AI Assistant to Workfront. AI Assistant can help you by:

* Summarizing work items and documents, allowing you to quickly gain a general understanding of tasks, projects, and assets.
* Providing information from Experience League documentation, bringing instructions and reference material into Workfront, while linking to more in-depth documentation.
* Creating and refining formulas for calculated custom form fields, generating formulas from text prompts, or locating errors in existing formulas.

Your Workfront administrator can enable or disable AI Assistant for your organization. The AI Assistant is available for instances with Select, Prime, and Ultimate plans.
