# Fourth Quarter 2024 release overview

This page provides information about functionality that is included in the Fourth Quarter 2024 release. These enhancements are planned to become available in the Production environment throughout the quarter.

<span class="preview">Off-cycle features (those releasing to Production prior to the Fourth Quarter 2024 release date) are highlighted in yellow.</span>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The 23.3 release included the option to move your organization to monthly releases. Therefore, Workfront has changed the numbering scheme of releases to account for both monthly and quarterly release tracks. The first number designates the year, and the second number signifies the month of the release. Example: The release for April, 2024 reads as 24.4.
>
>Monthly and quarterly releases are planned to be available on the Thursday of the second full week of the month, unless otherwise specified.
>
>|Monthly release|Quarterly release|
>|----|----|
>|<ul><li>There are no planned features for the 24.8 (August 2024) release</li><li>24.9 (September 2024)</li><li>24.10 (October 2024)</li></ul>| <ul><li>24.10 (October 2024)</li></ul>|
>
>Note that for the final release of each quarter (24.10 this quarter), users on the fast release schedule will receive the release one day early.
>
>For more information on the fast release process, see [Enable or disable the fast release process](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/enable-fast-release-process.md).
