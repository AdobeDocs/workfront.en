# Fourth Quarter 2024 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q4-release-activity/24-q4-release-overview.md).

## Roll back environment promotion packages

To make environment promotion more flexible and easier to use, we've enabled rollback functionality. Now, you can roll back packages within 24 hours, allowing you to more easily restore previous configurations that have been affected by an environment promotion package.

Previously, configurations would be restored manually, or through another environment promotion package.

For more information on rolling back an environment promotion package, see [Roll back an environment promotion package](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/environment-promotion-rollback.md).

## Layout button on the custom form designer allows two or three columns

A "Layout" button on the custom form designer allows you to choose from a two- or three-column working area. The original form designer uses three columns and the field settings are displayed in the far right column. If you select two columns, the field settings are displayed next to the field library in the far left column.

For information, see [Custom forms overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/custom-forms-overview.md).
