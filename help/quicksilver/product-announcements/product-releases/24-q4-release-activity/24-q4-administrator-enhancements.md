# Fourth Quarter 2024 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q4-release-activity/24-q4-release-overview.md).

## A "Select all" option is now available in layout templates

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: August 29, 2024; Production release for all customers: August 29, 2024

To help you more easily display and hide fields with layout templates, a **Select all** check box was added to the Overview and Finance areas of the Details view in a layout template. This option is available when you have selected Project, Task, Issue, Portfolio, or Program under under **Customize what users see**. Note that not all objects show the Finance area, and the fields in each area are different depending on the object.

For more information, see [Customize the Details view using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-details-view-layout-template.md).

## Roll back environment promotion packages

>Preview release: August 29, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.9 release (September 12, 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 24.10 release (October 2024)

To make environment promotion more flexible and easier to use, we've enabled rollback functionality. Now, you can roll back packages within 24 hours, allowing you to more easily restore previous configurations that have been affected by an environment promotion package.

Previously, configurations would be restored manually, or through another environment promotion package.

For more information on rolling back an environment promotion package, see [Roll back an environment promotion package](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/environment-promotion-rollback.md).

## Layout button on the custom form designer allows two or three columns

>_This feature is part of a phased release and will be available to a limited number of customers in September. It will remain in the Preview environment for an extended time while we gather feedback._

A "Layout" button on the custom form designer allows you to choose from a two- or three-column working area. The original form designer uses three columns and the field settings are displayed in the far right column. If you select two columns, the field settings are displayed next to the field library in the far left column.

For information, see [Custom forms overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/custom-forms-overview.md).
