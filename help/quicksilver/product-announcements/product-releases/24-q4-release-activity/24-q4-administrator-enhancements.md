# Fourth Quarter 2024 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q4-release-activity/24-q4-release-overview.md).

## Access level now available in environment promotion

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: October 17, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.10 release (October 17, 2024)

To expand the capabilities of environment promotion functionality, we've added the ability to include access levels. Now, you can configure an access level in a Sandbox environment, and then promote that access level to your production environment.

Previously, access levels were not available for environment promotion.

For more information on objects available for environment promotion, see [Supported objects for environment promotion](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/environment-promotion-in-wf.md#supported-objects-for-environment-promotion) in the article Environment promotion overview.

## A counter on custom forms shows the number of fields

>[!NOTE]

>Preview release: October 1, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.10 release (October 17, 2024)

Custom forms are limited to 500 fields. On a long form, it can be difficult to know how many fields are on the form and whether you are approaching the limit.

A counter has been added to custom forms on the bottom left. The counter displays how many fields are used on the form, and it is always visible as you scroll within the form designer.

For more information, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).

## A "Select all" option is now available in layout templates

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: August 29, 2024; Production release for all customers: August 29, 2024

To help you more easily display and hide fields with layout templates, a **Select all** check box was added to the Overview and Finance areas of the Details view in a layout template. This option is available when you have selected Project, Task, Issue, Portfolio, or Program under under **Customize what users see**. Note that not all objects show the Finance area, and the fields in each area are different depending on the object.

For more information, see [Customize the Details view using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-details-view-layout-template.md).

## Roll back environment promotion packages

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: August 29, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.9 release (September 12, 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 24.10 release (October 17, 2024)

To make environment promotion more flexible and easier to use, we've enabled rollback functionality. Now, you can roll back packages within 24 hours, allowing you to more easily restore previous configurations that have been affected by an environment promotion package.

Previously, configurations would be restored manually, or through another environment promotion package.

For more information on rolling back an environment promotion package, see [Roll back an environment promotion package](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/environment-promotion-rollback.md).

## Layout button on the custom form designer allows two or three columns

>[!NOTE]
>
>~~Preview release: August 12, 2024~~; Production for fast release: N/A; Production for quarterly release: N/A
>
>_This feature has been removed from Preview and will not be released with any future releases._

A "Layout" button on the custom form designer allows you to choose from a two- or three-column working area. The original form designer uses three columns and the field settings are displayed in the far right column. If you select two columns, the field settings are displayed next to the field library in the far left column.

For information, see [Custom forms overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/custom-forms-overview.md).
