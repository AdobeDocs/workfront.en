# 21.1 Mobile enhancements

This page describes all Mobile enhancements coming with the 21.1 release. These enhancements will be made available in the mobile stores the week of February 15, 2021.

For a list of all changes available with the 21.1 release, see [21.1 release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/21.1-release-activity/21-1-release-overview.md).

## New navigation breadcrumbs in the Adobe Workfront app

We've added breadcrumb navigation to the Workfront mobile app. Now, you can use this feature to navigate to parent work items within a project.

## Rich text supported in custom forms on the Workfront app 

You can now use rich text formatting in custom form text fields in the Workfront mobile app.

For more information on how to create a custom form with text fields, see [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

## SSO users can now re-login to the Workfront app with Face ID or Fingerprint technology

If your organization uses SSO, you can now use your Face ID or Fingerprint to login to the Workfront mobile app after your session as timed out. You must log in with your SSO credentials initially though.

For information on how to log in to the Workfront mobile app with SSO, see [Log in to Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/manage-your-account-and-profile/managing-your-workfront-account/log-in-to-workfront.md).
