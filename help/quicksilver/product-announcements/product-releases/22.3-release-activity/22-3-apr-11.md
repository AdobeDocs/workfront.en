## For administrators: Deactivate a group from the Groups page

Recently, we added the ability to deactivate and reactivate groups. To make that action quicker and easier, we have added it to a group's page. Now, after you click a group's name to go to its page, you can select the More menu ![](assets/more-icon.png) next to the group's name, then select Deactivate or Reactivate.

Previously, you could deactivate or reactivate a group only by using the Is active check box on its Details page.

For more information, see [Deactivate or reactivate a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-group.md).

## For administrators: Add videos to custom forms

Now you can provide a new mode of information, visual interest, and creativity to a custom form by adding a video. When the form is attached to an object, users who work with the object can play the video any time.

Previously, you could add only text-based fields and images to a custom form.

For more information, see [Add or edit an asset widget in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-widget-or-edit-its-properties-in-a-custom-form.md).
