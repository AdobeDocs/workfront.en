# Look-and-feel updates during the 22.3 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the 22.3 release timeframe. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment a minimum of 2 weeks after releasing to Preview.

For a list of all changes available with the 22.3 release, see [22.3 Release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/22.3-release-activity/22-3-release-overview.md).

## Global look and feel updates

To better align Adobe products and to improve consistency throughout the Workfront application, we’re releasing minor cosmetic styling changes throughout the Workfront user interface.

Buttons, colors, and fonts are now updated throughout the Workfront application.

These updates are solely visual changes; the underlying functionality remains unchanged.

## Updated lists and reports

The toolbars on the following lists and reports now have a modern look and feel, allowing you to quickly manage objects in Adobe Workfront.

## Updated breadcrumb separators

>This change was updated in Production on May 23, 2022. See the [Maintenance Update on May 26, 2022 for more information](https://one.workfront.com/s/article/Maintenance-Update-on-May-26-2022). 

We have updated the breadcrumb separators in all areas where breadcrumbs are available. Now, the objects in the breadcrumbs are separated by pipes (|). Prior to this update, they were separated by forward slashes (/).
