# 22.3 Resource Management enhancements

This page describes all Resource Management enhancements made with the 22.3 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment the week of July 11, 2022. For a list of all changes available with the 22.3 release, see [22.3 Release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/22.3-release-activity/22-3-release-overview.md).

## Sorting preferences and usability enhancements in the Workload Balancer

To improve your experience when using the Workload Balancer, we have introduced the following enhancements:

*   Improved sorting in the Unassigned and Assigned sections.
    
    You can now sort by users’ names or job roles (in the Unassigned Work area) and by project fields in both the Unassigned and Assigned Work areas.
    
*   Mousing over tasks or issues displays additional information (project name, Planned Start and End Dates, dependencies, Planned Hours, parent tasks’ names).
    
*   The project bars have a new look and feel to make them more easily distinguishable from tasks.
    
*   An updated, easier-to-read design for Projected Dates.
