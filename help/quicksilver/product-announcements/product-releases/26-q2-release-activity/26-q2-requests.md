In the New requests area, when you share an enhanced view with a user and give them View permissions, the user can modify the view elements and those changes are saved to the user's personal preferences. They now have the option to save a copy of the view that includes their changes or to reset the shared view to its original settings. They can further share the copied view with others.  

This update is available only for the New requests area enhanced view.
