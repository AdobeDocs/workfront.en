Multi‑stage approval workflows are now available in unified approvals, helping organizations enforce structured, repeatable approval processes that reflect how work is reviewed in the real world. With multi‑stage approvals, you can:

* Route work through defined sequential stages 
* Assign the people or teams to each stage and choose their decision role
* Set stage‑specific deadlines 
* Ensure approvals progress only when required decisions are complete
* Maintain visibility into approval progress

You can now configure and reuse multi-stage approval workflow templates, making it easier to apply consistent governance across repeatable approval workflows. 

With approval workflow templates, you can: 

* Create sequential approval stages with unique participants and deadlines
* Reduce manual setup time during approval initiation
* Ensure required stakeholders are engaged at the right stage
