# Second Quarter 2026 Reporting enhancements

This page describes Reporting enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2026 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2026 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2026 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/26-q1-release-activity/26-q1-release-overview.md).

## Custom field labels shown when building reports

>Production fast release: March 12, 2026
>Production for everyone: April 16, 2026

The custom field label is now displayed before the field name and object in the report building tools, helping you locate fields more easily. Field labels are also shown when defining filters, views, and groupings in lists.

The custom field label is intended for the system interface, while the field name is frequently used for the API and back-end storage purposes, and may not be as helpful when locating a field.

For more information, see [Create a custom report](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

## Shareable Report Folders

You can now organize and share reports using shareable report folders. This new feature helps teams that manage large volumes of reports maintain scalable and consistent access control:

* **Create organized folder structures**: System administrators can create top-level folders, and users with manage access can create subfolders up to 4 levels deep.
* **Granular permission controls**: Share folders with two permission levels:
   * View: Users can open reports and share folders
   * Manage: Users can edit folder details, add/remove items, and automatically receive manage access to all reports within the folder
* **Inherited permissions**: Permissions cascade from parent folders to all subfolders and reports within the folder tree
* **Enhanced list experience**: When you enable sharable folders, you will have access to the enhanced list experience. For more information, see [Use enhanced lists](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/enhanced-lists.md).

## Improved Date Labels for Chart Groupings in Canvas Dashboards

Charts that group data by date now display clearer, more readable date labels. With this update, date labels dynamically adjust based on the selected Group by option—such as day, week, month, or year—making charts easier to read and interpret at a glance:

<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Day</td> <td>Displays the full date. Example: 3/12/2026</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Week</td> <td>Displays a formatted week start date. Example, Mar 8, 2026</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Displays the month and year. Example Mar 2026</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Year</td> <td>Displays the year only. Example: 2026</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

Previously, chart groupings always showed the start date of the selected period in a numeric format.
