# Second Quarter 2026 Administrator enhancements

This page describes Administrator enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2026 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2026 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2026 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/26-q1-release-activity/26-q1-release-overview.md).

## Collapse custom form section by default

By default, all sections on a custom form are expanded when the form itself is expanded. A new option on the custom form designer allows you to mark a section to be collapsed by default when a user opens the form. This option is applied at the section level, not on fields.

For more information, see [Organize and preview a form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/organize-a-form.md).

## Rich text field type is now available on custom forms

The new **Rich text** field type in custom forms is a robust text editor, with formatting options such as superscript and subscript, headings, and tables, in addition to the traditional options of bold, italics, underline, bullets, numbering, hyperlinks, and block quotes. The character limit remains 15,000.

The Rich text field type is replacing the Text with formatting field type. You can quickly convert existing Text with formatting fields to Rich text, by clicking the button in the field options on the right. When you convert, historical data remains on the field and it is used the same way in reports.

For more information, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).
