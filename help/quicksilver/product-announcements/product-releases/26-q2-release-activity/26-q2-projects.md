# Second Quarter 2026 Project enhancements

This page describes Project enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2026 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2026 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2026 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/26-q1-release-activity/26-q1-release-overview.md).

The new **Rich text** field type in custom forms is a robust text editor, with formatting options such as superscript and subscript, headings, and tables, in addition to the traditional options of bold, italics, underline, bullets, numbering, hyperlinks, and block quotes. The character limit remains 15,000.

The Rich text field type is replacing the Text with formatting field type. You can quickly convert existing Text with formatting fields to Rich text, by clicking the button in the field options on the right.
