<!--### Functionality soon to be removed from Workfront-->

## Interface modernization

We are updating the interface throughout Adobe Workfront to improve the user experience and unify it with other Adobe applications. These changes are released outside the standard release schedule. For a list of these changes, see [Interface Modernization](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/interface-modernization/interface-modernization.md).

-->

## Release notes for other areas

### Workfront Fusion enhancements

New features in Workfront Fusion are available in Production at a cadence outside of the standard release schedule. For more information about the latest features, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity).

### Workfront Planning enhancements

## Desktop proofing viewer updates

### Version 2.1.54

**Production release for all customers: December 11, 2025**

The Desktop Proofing Viewer has been updated to from 2.1.52 to 2.1.54. This update included internal tooling updates and did not impact end-user functionality.

The 2.1.53 version also included internal tooling changes. 

This update is for both Mac and Windows.

## Announcements

### API version 21

Workfront API version 21 was released on October 23, 2025. For API version 21, we've modified some resources and endpoints. Some of the changes support new functionality, and others make it easier for you to use the information available through the API.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This API version change features a breaking change that may affect your existing API calls. This is due to the fact that API version 21 uses Event Subscriptions version 2.
>
> For multi-select fields, Event Subsscriptions version 2 always sends as an array. Version 1 sent an array if more than one value selected. If only one value was selected, it sent a string.

For information on what's new and updated, see [What's new in API version 21](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/new-api-version-21.md).

For information on API versions, see [API versioning and support schedule](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/api-version-support-schedule.md).

### Other Workfront integration transitions

To deliver more stable and scalable integrations, we're shifting to a modern, flexible integration approach using Workfront Automation and Integration (Fusion). As part of this transition process, the following integrations will not be available after **February 28, 2026**: 

* Workfront for G Suite 
* Workfront for Jira 
* Workfront for Salesforce. 

We recommend using Workfront Automation and Integration for your organization's integration needs with Google Workspace. 
For an overview of Workfront Automation and Integration, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/get-started-with-fusion/understand-workfront-fusion/workfront-fusion-overview).
