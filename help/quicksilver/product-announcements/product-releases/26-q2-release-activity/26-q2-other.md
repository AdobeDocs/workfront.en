To allow organizations access to the benefits of the Adobe Unified Experience, we're continuing to make it available to existing Workfront customers. 

The Adobe Unified Experience includes:

* A single login for all Adobe applications through Adobe Experience Cloud
* An "organization switcher" to move between Workfront organizations and environments
* Navigation with options for Workfront pages, Adobe Experience Cloud preferences, and your Workfront profile

Your Workfront administrator will receive an Announcement Center message regarding the date when your organization will move to the Adobe Unified Experience.
