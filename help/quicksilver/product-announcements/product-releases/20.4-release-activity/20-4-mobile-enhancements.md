# 20.4 Mobile and integration enhancements

This page describes all mobile enhancements made with the 20.4 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of November 9, 2020.

For a list of all changes available with the 20.4 release, see [20.4 release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/20.4-release-activity/20-4-release-overview.md).

## Added functionality in Microsoft Teams notifications

>[!NOTE]
>
>This functionality is not yet available but is coming soon to the Preview environment. It will be made available in Production with the 20.4 release.

To make it easier for you to use Workfront through Microsoft Teams, we've added some new functionality to Microsoft Teams notifications sent from Workfront.

* We've expanded the types of notifications you can receive in Microsoft Teams. Now you can receive notifications about a greater variety of events, such as when someone comments on your timesheet or wants you to approve a document.
* You can now comment and reply directly in the notification. Your comments and replies appear in Workfront in the work item's update stream.
* We've made it possible for you to see a work item's custom forms in the notification, and expand the custom form to see its fields.
* When you receive a notification about a project, task, or issue, you can now change the status of the work item directly in the notification.

For more information, see [Manage Adobe Workfront notifications in Microsoft Teams](../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-microsoft-teams/manage-wf-notifications-approval-requests-ms-teams.md).

## Introducing Workfront for MobileIron

Workfront has partnered with MobileIron, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform, to provide organizations a more secure and controlled mobile experience.

With Workfront for MobileIron, administrators can restrict things like copy/paste functionality and screen captures. You can download the Workfront for MobileIron app at [https://marketplace.mobileiron.com/listing/workfront](https://marketplace.mobileiron.com/listing/workfront).

For information on configuring the app, see [Configure Adobe Workfront for MobileIron](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/wf-mobileiron-configs.md).

## Create a task quickly in the Workfront mobile app

Use the new quick task option in the Workfront mobile app to quickly create tasks. Simply enter the task name and attach any documents you might have. You can still fill in additional fields like descriptions and assignments if needed. Just click the arrow to the right of the task name.

Previously, the description and assignments fields were always visible when creating a task.

For more information, see

* [Adobe Workfront for iOS](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/workfront-for-ios.md) 
* [Adobe Workfront for Android](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/workfront-for-android.md)

## Get help with Workfront mobile's virtual assistant commands

While in the mobile app, you can ask the virtual assistant to help you with commands by saying:

* "What can I do?"
* "Help me with commands."

These commands display a list of the different things you can ask the assistant about.

For a list of existing commands, see [Adobe Workfront mobile app virtual assistant](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/wf-mobile-virtual-assistant.md).
