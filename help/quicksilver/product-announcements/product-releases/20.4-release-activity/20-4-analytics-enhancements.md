# 20. 4 Analytics enhancements

This page describes all analytics enhancements made with the 20.4 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of November 9, 2020.

For a list of all changes available with the 20.4 release, see [20.4 release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/20.4-release-activity/20-4-release-overview.md).

## Pagination and sorting added to Enhanced analytics

To allow you to view the information you want to see without having to apply restrictive filters, we've made the following changes:

* The project count in the top-right corner of the screen displays only the total amount of projects within the applied filters.
* Each chart now allows you to view additional projects in groups of 50 (e.g., 51-100, 150-200, and so on) by selecting a page number to jump to a specific set of projects or using the arrows to navigate forward and backward between pages. Selecting a new page on one chart updates projects for the entire screen.
* Each chart now has a Sort by menu that allows you to sort alphabetically, by the Planned Start Date, or by the Planned Completion Date.

Previously, the Enhanced analytics area limited the amount of projects that you could look at to 50.

This feature is now included in the [Enhanced Analytics, Part 1 learning path](https://one.workfront.com/s/learningpath2/enhanced-analytics-part-1-overview-20Y0z000000bmgOEAQ) on Workfront One.
