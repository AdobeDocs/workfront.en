# 2020.1 Resource Management enhancements

This page describes all enhancements made to Resource Management functionality with the 2020.1 release. These enhancements are currently available in the Preview environment and will be made available in the Production environment in late March or early April, 2020.

For a list of all changes available with the 2020.1 release, see [2020.1 release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/2020.1-release-activity/2020-1-release-overview.md).

## Show daily Planned Hours for projects, tasks, and inaccessible items in the Assigned Work area of the Workload Balancer

To help you understand how individual projects, tasks, or inaccessible items contribute to the workload of your users and to be able to make correct reassignment decisions in the Workload Balancer, we have introduced a setting that allows you to view the hourly distribution for individual projects, tasks and inaccessible items.

For information about managing hours in the Workload Balancer, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md).

## Show daily Planned Hours for tasks, and inaccessible items in the Unassigned Work area of the Workload Balancer

To help you understand how individual projects, tasks, or inaccessible items will affect the workload of your users, the "Show allocations" setting is now managing what information displays in the Unassigned Work area of the Workload Balancer.

Prior to this change, this setting was updating only information in the Assigned Work area of the Balancer.

For information about navigating the Workload Balancer, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md).

## Adjust timeline duration in the Workload Balancer

You now have the flexibility to select how many weeks you display in the Workload Balancer: you can select from 2, 4, or 6 weeks. Previously, the number of weeks was set to 4 by default.

For information about navigating the Workload Balancer, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md).

## The Display Actual Hours setting removed from the Resource Planner

To make displaying Actual Hours in the Resource Planner easier, we have removed the Display Actual Hours setting from the Resource Planner.

You can still display Actual Hours when viewing the Resource Planner in the User View by using the Customize view feature.

For information about navigating the Resource Planner, see [Resource Planner navigation overview](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planner-navigation.md).

## Improved navigation in the Workload Balancer

Now, you can navigate back and forth in the Workload Balancer one time period at a time. Prior to this enhancement when you clicked the back and forward icons, the timeframe shifted by four time periods at a time.

For information about using the Workload Balancer, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md).
