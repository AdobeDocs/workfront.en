# Interface modernization

This page lists interface updates we are making throughout Adobe Workfront to improve the user experience and unify it with other Adobe applications. These changes are primarily visual and will not significantly alter workflows, unless otherwise noted.

>In most cases, each update is first released to the Preview environment, then incrementally enabled in the Production environment for a growing subset of customers beginning on the listed Production release date.

For all other changes to Adobe Workfront, see [Product releases](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md).
