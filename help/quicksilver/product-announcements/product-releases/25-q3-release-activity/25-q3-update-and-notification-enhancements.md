To achieve improved performance, we have introduced a modified experience when adding people to comments. Now, the "Tag people or teams" link remains persistent in the Comment box, after you start adding users or teams to the comment. Prior to this change, the "Tag people or teams" link was removed after starting adding people or teams to a comment. This change has been introduced to all Workfront objects where you can add a comment. 

For more information, see [Update work](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).
