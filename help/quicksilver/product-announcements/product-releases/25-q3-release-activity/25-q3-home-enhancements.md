# Third Quarter 2025 Home enhancements

This page describes all Home enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q3-release-activity/25-q3-release-overview.md).

## My approvals widget now automatically sorts by deadline

We have updated the My Approvals widget in home to sort by deadline (descending) by default. This allows the most urgent approvals to appear at the top of the list.

Previously, the widget sorted by entry date, which made it challenging to determine priority.
