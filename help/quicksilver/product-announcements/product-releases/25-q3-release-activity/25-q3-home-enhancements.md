# Third Quarter 2025 Home enhancements

This page describes all Home enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q3-release-activity/25-q3-release-overview.md).

<!--## All Approvals widget renamed to Document approval metrics

We've renamed the All Approvals widget to Document Approval Metrics to more accurately reflect the information it displays. The Document Approval Metrics widget provides high-level insights into document approvals for the projects you own.

This widget does not contain any information about proof approvals. -->

## Updated commenting experience in the Mentions section on the My Updates area

>* Preview: December 19, 2024

>* Production for all customers:  June 19, 2025 

We are updating the commenting experience in the Mentions section in the My Updates area. Now, the same experience in the Updates area of most Workfront objects is also available in the Mentions section of My Updates.   

Prior to this enhancement, the legacy commenting experience was available in this area.   

For information, see [Use the My Updates area](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/my-updates-area.md).

## My approvals widget now automatically sorts by deadline

>[!NOTE]

>* Production for all customers:  July 17, 2025

We have updated the My Approvals widget in home to sort by deadline (descending) by default. This allows the most urgent approvals to appear at the top of the list.

Currently, only Proof Approvals can be sorted by deadline in the My Approvals widget.

Previously, the widget sorted by entry date, which made it challenging to determine priority.
