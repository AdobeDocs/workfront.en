To make it more clear how AI Assistant is locating answers to questions about Workfront projects, tasks, and issues, we've added this information to the question response. Now, AI Assistant includes its search information in the output. You can use this information as a way to check that AI Assistant correctly identified the question you were asking and to understand the context of the answer. 

Previously, this information was not available in the AI Assistant's response.
