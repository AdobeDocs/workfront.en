## Assets in a linked Google folder must be added individually to appear in Workfront

>* Preview release: TBD; Production release for all customers: TBD

Google is [enhancing security controls](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/enhancing-security-controls-for-google-drive-third-party-apps) for third-party applications accessing Google Drive, requiring applications to adopt a per-user consent model. As a result, individual assets must be linked one at a time to be visible in Workfront. See [Configure document integrations](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-document-integrations.md) for more information. 

Key capabilities that remain unchanged: 

* Search and filter for assets and folders from within the Google Drive modal
* Link assets to Workfront objects from Google Drive
* Upload assets to Google Drive through the "Send To" dropdown on the documents page
* View and access folder structure in a user's My Drive area
* Link a new version of an asset from Google Drive to an existing document in Workfront
* Link folders to Workfront objects from Google Drive
* Upload assets to Google Drive by dragging and dropping documents into a linked folder
* Create a new Google Drive document from within Workfront


## New document approval decision buttons available in proofing viewer

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview release: April 10, 2025; Production release for all customers: April 17, 2025

The new document approval decision buttons now appear in the proofing viewer. Now, when you create a simple proof and then add approvers and reviewers from the Document summary, they can make their decision directly inside the proofing viewer.

Previously, you had to exit the proofing viewer to make a decision.

Approvals created before this release will not display the buttons in proofing viewer.

For more information, see [Use new document approvals and proofing together](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/doc-approvals-and-proofing.md).
