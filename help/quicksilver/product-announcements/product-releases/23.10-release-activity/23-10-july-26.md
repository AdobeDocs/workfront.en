# Q4 2023 release activity week of July 24, 2023

This page describes all enhancements made with the Q4 2023 release to the Preview environment the week of July 24, 2023. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the Q4 2023 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Q4 2023 release cycle, see [Q4 2023 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.10-release-activity/23-10-release-overview.md).

## Updated design when adding a new issue to a project 

This update has been announced with the 23.3 release.  

We have updated the New Issue box which displays when submitting a new issue to a project. Now, the interface matches the New request box which displays when submitting a new request to a request queue.  

For more information, see [Create issues](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/issues/manage-issues/create-issues.md). The documentation will be updated after the feature releases.
