To create a more seamless experience between Workfront and Workfront Planning, we've redesigned the My Requests widget in Home. The new widget features the following changes:

* Both Workfront and Workfront Planning requests appear in the widget.
* The filter is now more customizable. Now, you can filter by specific field values using And and Or rules.
* You can hide or rearrange columns in the widget.

You must have the new requesting experience enabled to see the new widget. You can enable the new requesting experience in your Requests area.

The new My Requests widget displays only those requests that were created in the new requesting experience.

For more information on the new My Requests widget, see [Use the My Requests widget](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/my-requests-widget.md).

For the release note regarding the new requesting experience, see [Updates to requesting experience](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q4-release-activity/25-q4-requests.md#updates-to-requesting-experience).
