### Functionality soon to be removed from Workfront

* 
-->

## Interface modernization

We are updating the interface throughout Adobe Workfront to improve the user experience and unify it with other Adobe applications. These changes are released outside the standard release schedule. For a list of these changes, see [Interface Modernization](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/interface-modernization/interface-modernization.md).

## Release notes for other areas

### Workfront Fusion enhancements

New features in Workfront Fusion are available in Production at a cadence outside of the standard release schedule. For more information about the latest features, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity).

### Workfront Planning enhancements

New features in Workfront Planning are available in Production. For more information about the latest features, see [Fourth Quarter 2025 release activity for Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/planning-release-activity/planning-release-activity-25-q4.md).

## Announcements

### New version of Workfront for Microsoft Teams

As [Microsoft transitions to the New Teams client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability), the Classic Teams client will no longer be available after July 1, 2025. To continue using Microsoft Teams and integrated apps like Workfront, customers must transition to the New Teams client before this date. 

The updated Workfront integration is now available and fully compatible with the New Teams experience. In most cases, Workfront will appear automatically once users have transitioned. If it does not, the integration can be manually installed from the Microsoft Teams App Store. To install or verify the Workfront integration in the New Teams client, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for Microsoft Teams](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-microsoft-teams/install-workfront-ms-teams.md).

### Workfront for Microsoft Outlook

[Microsoft is in the process of disabling support for legacy Exchange online tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens), which are currently used by the Workfront Outlook add-in for authentication. This change by Microsoft has already started affecting customers and will continue to roll out in phases through October 2025.

* **After Microsoft fully disables these tokens, the Workfront for Microsoft Outlook integration will no longer function.** 

As part of this change, Microsoft has made the decision to change the way tokens are re-enabled. After **June 30, 2025**, admins will no longer be able to re-enable tokens themselves—only Microsoft Support can grant exceptions. **On October 1, 2025, legacy tokens will be turned off for all tenants. Exceptions will not be granted.**  

### API version 20

Workfront API version 20 was released on May 4, 2024. For API version 20, we've modified some resources and endpoints. Some of the changes support new functionality, and others make it easier for you to use the information available through the API.

For information on what's new and updated, see [What's new in API version 20](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/new-api-version-19.md).

For information on API versions, see [API versioning and support schedule](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/api-version-support-schedule.md).
