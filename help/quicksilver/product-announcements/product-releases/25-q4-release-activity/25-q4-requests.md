# Fourth Quarter 2025 Requests enhancements

This page describes Requests enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q4-release-activity/25-q4-release-overview.md).

To simplify the unified request experience, the Status column now displays both Request Status and Approval Status, whichever applies to a given request.

To create a better user experience when making requests in Workfront and Workfront Planning, we've updated the requesting experience. Now you can:

* View Workfront and Workfront Planning requests in a single list.
* Filter submitted requests based on criteria you specify.
* Search for and select Workfront request queues and Workfront Planning forms in a consolidated experience.
* Hide and reorder columns in the submitted requests list.

This update also features changes to the look and feel of the page. 

Be aware of the follwing when using the new Requesting experience:

* Drafts are now found in the same list as submitted requests
* The new experience currently shows only requests created in the past 1.5 months. To see older requests, you can temporarily disable the new experience and access the older requests through the old experience. 

Previously, Workfront and Workfront Planning requests were on separate tabs, and filters were not customizable.

For more information on creating requests see:

* For Workfront: [Create and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md)
* For Workfront Planning: [Submit Adobe Workfront Planning requests to create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/submit-requests.md)
