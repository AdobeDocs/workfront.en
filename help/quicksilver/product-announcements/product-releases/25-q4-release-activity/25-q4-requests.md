To create a better user experience when making requests in Workfront and Workfront Planning, we've updated the requesting experience. Now you can:

* View Workfront and Workfront Planning requests in a single list.
* Filter submitted requests based on criteria you specify.
* Search for and select Workfront request queues and Workfront Planning forms in a consolidated experience.
* Hide and reorder columns in the submitted requests list.

This update also features changes to the look and feel of the page.

Previously, Workfront and Workfront Planning requests were on separate tabs, and filters were not customizable.

For more information on creating requests see:

* For Workfront: [Create and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md)
* For Workfront Planning: [Submit Adobe Workfront Planning requests to create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/submit-requests.md)
