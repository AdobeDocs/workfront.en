A new field type, Multi-select external lookup, is now available on the custom form designer. When you have data stored on an external system, this field type allows you to load options from an external API and filter based on other field values in the custom form. This is the same as a single-select external lookup.

When the form is added to an object, the values returned from the API appear in a dropdown field and the user can select multiple values.

For more information, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).
