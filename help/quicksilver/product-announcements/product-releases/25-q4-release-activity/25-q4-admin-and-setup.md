# Fourth Quarter 2025 Administrator enhancements

This page describes Administrator enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q4-release-activity/25-q4-release-overview.md).

## Confirmation when removing a custom form from an object

>[!NOTE]

>* Preview: September 25, 2025
>* Production fast release: October 15, 2025
>* Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

To make sure you retain access to the data you need, we've added a confirmation dialog when removing a custom form from an object. Removing a custom form from an object permanently removes the data in that form from the object. Now, the dialog allows you to confirm that you understand that this data will be removed, ensuring that you do not remove data that you require. 

Previously, the only warning of data removal was text near the remove option.

For more information on removing a custom form, see [Remove a custom form from an object](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/manage-custom-forms-attached-to-objects.md#remove-a-custom-form-from-an-object) in the article Manage custom forms attached to objects.

## Updates to the Workfront user profile

>* Preview: August 28, 2025
>* Production for all customers: Phased rollout starting September 25, 2025

We have updated the look and feel of the Workfront user profile to a modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. These updates apply to both an administrator editing a single profile or bulk editing multiple profiles, or a user editing their own profile.

There are some small functionality differences from the current user profile, including:

* Some check boxes (such as marking the user as active) have changed to toggles or buttons.
* The "Send work I assign to myself to my Working On tab" option under Preferences was removed because it refers to a deprecated feature.

For more information, see [Edit a user's profile](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

## New Boards Admin View

>* Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

The Boards Admin View contains a list of every Board in your account that System Administrators can use to get a quick snapshot of the overall Boards details, including when they were last updated, how many cards each one has, and more.

For more, see [Manage the Boards Admin View ](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/manage-boards-admin-view.md).

## Enable AI Beta features for your organization

>[!NOTE]

>* Preview: August 28, 2025
>* Production fast release: September 11, 2025
>* Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

To make it easier for you to see and influence upcoming AI features, we've made it possible for you to enable the Betas for those features for your organization. Now, you can choose to enable one or more of the currently available AI Beta features from your System Preferences.

Previously, Beta features could not be enabled by system administrators.

For more information on setting system preferences, see [Configure system preferences](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/configure-security-preferences.md).

For prerequisites to enabling AI features, see [Prerequisites to AI Assistant](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-overview.md#prerequisites-to-ai-assistant).



## Add multiple value options from an external API to a custom form

>[!NOTE]

>* Preview: July 31, 2025
>* Production fast release: August 14, 2025
>* Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

A new field type, Multi-select external lookup, is now available on the custom form designer. When you have data stored on an external system, this field type allows you to load options from an external API and filter based on other field values in the custom form. This is the same as a single-select external lookup.

When the form is added to an object, the values returned from the API appear in a dropdown field and the user can select multiple values.

For more information, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).
