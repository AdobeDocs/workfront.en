# Other enhancements during the Fourth Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q4-release-activity/25-q4-release-overview.md).

## Report Summary tab updates

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview: October 6, 2025
>* Production fast release: October 6, 2025
>* Production for all customers: October 6, 2025

The Summary tab of a report has been updated with the following enhancements: 

* The grouping field names prefixing for each row have been moved to the first column header.

* The name column is now slash-delimited (separated by a forward slash) when multiple grouping levels are applied to a report.

* The aggregation type prefix ("Sum: ", "Max: ", "Min: ", "Avg: ") has been removed from each aggregation.

* The aggregation type for each column now displays as an appendix to the column header value.

* Sub-groupings (2 or 3 groupings) display as indented levels in the first column. Top-level groupings still show up in bold.

* You can now adjust the column widths. The columns will revert to the default width distribution when the page is refreshed.

>[!NOTE]

>The first four changes also apply to Summary tab exports where applicable. Level indentations and bold font will not transfer to an exported, tab-delimited text file.
