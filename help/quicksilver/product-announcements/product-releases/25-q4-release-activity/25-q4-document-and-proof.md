## Unified Approvals Phased Rollout

>Production release for customers: Phased rollout starting July 17,2025


We are enabling Unified Approvals, previously known as New Document Approvals, in a phased rollout. This functionality will be enabled automatically in your Workfront instance over the next six months. 

Unified Approvals replaces Legacy document approvals and provides the following functionality directly on a document:

* Designate an entire Workfront team as either reviewers or approvers
* Set a deadline for the review or approval
* Create and reuse approval templates
* Utilize new versions
* View multiple key performance indicators for your approvals in Workfront Home widgets
* Use Canvas Dashboards to view reporting details about Unified Approvals

For more information see [Unified Approvals Overview](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/document-approvals-overview.md).

## New Workfront AI Reviewer

>Available for all customers August 14, 2025

The new Workfront AI Reviewer helps ensure image brand compliance by automatically reviewing content against your brand guidelines, starting with image guidelines. It provides a score and actionable feedback to streamline the approval process. 

You can add the AI Reviewer to approval templates or individual review and approval requests, enabling faster content production while maintaining brand standards.

For more information, see [Get started with the Workfront AI Reviewer](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/wf-ai-reviewer.md).
