## New proofing integration for Adobe Express

We are excited to announce a new integration between Adobe Express and Workfront Proof.

With this integration, you can 

* Streamline collaboration between creative, legal, and compliance teams to reduce time-to-publish while maintaining oversight  

* Conduct for deep reviews using drawing markups, annotations, and commenting with the Workfront proofing viewer 

* Meet enterprise compliance standards with electronic signatures and full audit logs 

* Require approval on any remixed files from an Express branded template  

* Map an Express template to a multi-stage review and approval workflow using advanced proof templates

Note: The integration must be enabled for your accounts by the Adobe Product Team.
