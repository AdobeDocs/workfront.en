For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q4-release-activity/25-q4-release-overview.md).

## New Project Health beta

The new Project Health feature utilizes the power of AI Assistant to instantly give you an assessment of how your projects are performing and what areas need your attention.

AI Assistant can generate a Project Health assessment for a project, a program, and multiple projects.

For more, see [Project Health overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/project-health-overview.md).

This feature is currently in beta.

## Create project intake forms in Workfront

>[!NOTE]

>* Preview: August 21, 2025
>* Production fast release: September 11, 2025
>* Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

To make it easier to create requested projects without converting from issues, we've created Project intake forms. You can configure these intake forms with specific fields, templates, and custom forms, and set approvers for project creation. Then, when a user uses this form, the project is configured to your specifications and sent for approval.

Previously, requests were entered into Workfront as issues, which had to be converted to projects.

For information and instructions about project intake forms, see [Create project intake forms](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-project-intake-form.md).

## New expressions added to calculated custom fields in Workfront

>* Production for all customers: August 7, 2025

We have added new expressions with the following usage to formula fields in Workfront Planning and to calculated custom fields in Workfront:

* **REMOVEACCENTS(string)**: Removes diacritical marks from all accented characters in the input string.
* **REPLACEPATTERN (string, pattern, replacement string)**: Replaces the matches of the given pattern with the replacement string. 
* **PASCAL(string)**: Converts the input string to PascalCase by capitalizing the first letter of each word and removing all spaces.

For more information, see [Overview of calculated data expressions](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-data-expressions.md).

## Additional way to access Advanced Assignments from lists

>[!NOTE]

>* Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

An **Advanced** button is now available for assignments in lists, making it faster for you to access the Advanced Assignments page. The **People** icon to get to Advanced Assignments is also available on assignments in lists.

This change applies to both task and issue assignments.

For more information, see [Create advanced assignments](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/create-advanced-assignments.md).
