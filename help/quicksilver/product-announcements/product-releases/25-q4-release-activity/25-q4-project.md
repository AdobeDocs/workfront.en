We have added new expressions with the following usage to formula fields in Workfront Planning and to calculated custom fields in Workfront:

* **REMOVEACCENTS(text)**: Removes diacritical marks from all accented characters in the input string.

* **REPLACEPATTERN (string, pattern, replacement string)**: Replaces the matches of the given pattern with the replacement string.

* **PASCALCASE(text)**: Converts the input string to PascalCase by capitalizing the first letter of each word and removing all spaces.

## Additional way to access Advanced Assignments from lists

An **Advanced** button is now available for assignments in lists, making it faster for you to access the Advanced Assignments page. The **People** icon to get to Advanced Assignments is also available on assignments in lists.

This change applies to both task and issue assignments.
