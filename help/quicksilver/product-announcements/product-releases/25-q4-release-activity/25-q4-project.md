We have added new expressions with the following usage to formula fields in Workfront Planning and to calculated custom fields in Workfront:

* **REMOVEACCENTS(string)**: Removes diacritical marks from all accented characters in the input string.
* **REPLACEPATTERN (string, pattern, replacement string)**: Replaces the matches of the given pattern with the replacement string. 
* **PASCAL(string)**: Converts the input string to PascalCase by capitalizing the first letter of each word and removing all spaces.

For more information, see [Overview of calculated data expressions](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/calc-cstm-data-reports/calculated-data-expressions.md).

An **Advanced** button is now available for assignments in lists, making it faster for you to access the Advanced Assignments page. The **People** icon to get to Advanced Assignments is also available on assignments in lists.

This change applies to both task and issue assignments.
