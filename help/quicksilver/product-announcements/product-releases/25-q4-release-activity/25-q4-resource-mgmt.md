For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q4-release-activity/25-q4-release-overview.md).

All users can now view their own demand and capacity data in the Workload Balancer from their profile, regardless of their access level. When you access your Workfront user profile, the Workload Balancer appears in the left navigation panel.

Workload Balancer data for a user is read-only. You can't assign work, unassign work, or adjust allocations at the user level.

For information, see [Locate the Workload Balancer](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/locate-workload-balancer.md).

## Role assignments display in the Workload Balancer

Resource managers can now review job role assignments in the Workload Balancer. The assignments are displayed in the Unassigned Work area, under the tasks or issues the roles are assigned to. Only work items assigned to users are displayed in the Assigned Work area.

A new Workload Balancer setting, Show Role Assignments, determines whether role assignments are displayed. The setting is enabled by default.

You can assign a role assignment to a user manually with the **More menu > Assign this to** option, or by dragging and dropping the item to the correct user. A visual indicator shows when the user's role and the assignment role do not match, but you can still assign the work to the user.

For information, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md) and [Assign work in the Workload Balancer by dragging and dropping](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/assign-work-in-workload-balancer-by-drag-and-drop.md).
