# Look-and-feel updates during the Fourth Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the Fourth Quarter 2025 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the Fourth Quarter 2025 release, see [Fourth Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q4-release-activity/25-q4-release-overview.md).

## New look-and-feel updates for the Team Request widget list

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview: July 21, 2025
>* Production fast release: July 21, 2025
>* Production for all customers:  July 21, 2025

We have updated the look and feel of the list in the Team Request widget.  Following are a few small functionality changes:

* Project name and From cells are no longer linked
* The Assign icon is now + Assign

This change is the result of an issue fix related to the assign users button.


## Interface modernization

We are updating the interface throughout Adobe Workfront to improve the user experience and unify it with other Adobe applications. These changes are released outside the standard release schedule. For a list of these changes, see [Interface Modernization](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/interface-modernization/interface-modernization.md).
