## Event subscription filters

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Preview environment on May 20, 2021. It will release to the Production environment on June 3, 2021.

Event subscription filters are now enabled in preview environments. Event subscription filtering can be used to ensure that you receive only relevant messages. Creating filters for your subscriptions may significantly decrease the number of messages that your endpoint needs to consume.

To learn more about event subscriptions see [Event Subscription API](../../../wf-api/general/event-subs-api.md) and [FAQs - Event Subscriptions](../../../wf-api/general/event-subs-faq.md).
