## Deactivate roles no longer in use

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Preview environment on May 27, 2021. It will release to the Production environment on June 10, 2021.

To offer you the same experience as with users, teams, and companies, we have introduced a new feature that allows you to deactivate roles you no longer use. When you deactivate a role, it is no longer available for selection in typeahead fields for assigning and sharing objects. Deactivated roles still appear in search fields and filter options.

Tasks and issues assigned to a deactivated role as well as approval processes or routing rules continue to be assigned to these roles. You must update these objects to replace the inactive role with an active one, if they are yet to be completed.

For more information, see [Deactivate job roles](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/deactivate-job-roles.md).
