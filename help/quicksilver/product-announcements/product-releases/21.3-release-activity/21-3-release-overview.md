## Announcements

### Required IP allowlist update for using the Workfront for Jira integration

We've made some back-end updates to the Workfront for Jira integration. Please ensure that the following IP addresses listed in the [Configure your firewall's allowlist](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-firewall.md) article have been added to your allowlist for inbound and outbound connections:

* 34.213.36.118
* 35.160.0.242
* 3.209.27.146
* 18.205.251.4

These addresses were previously listed as necessary for other areas of Workfront, but are now also necessary for the Jira integration.

To prevent interruption in your Workfront for Jira integration, your organization must allow these IP addresses by August 4, 2021.

For more information on configuring the Jira integration, see [Install Adobe Workfront for Jira](../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/install-workfront-for-jira.md).

### API version 13

For API version 13, we've modified various resources and endpoints. Some of the changes support new functionality, and others make it easier for you to use the information available through the API.

For information on what's new and updated, see [What's new in API version 13](../../../wf-api/api/new-api-version-13.md).

## 21.3 Release Webinar

The Workfront 21.3 Release Webinar was presented on June 16, 2021. You can view the recording [here](https://webinars.on24.com/workfront/213Release?partnerref=WFAC).

<!--
<div data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
<h2>Functionality being removed from Production</h2>
<h3>Feature rollback: Carry over the existing proof workflow when generating a new version</h3>
<p>Due to customer feedback, <b>Workfront is removing this change from Preview environments on March 30, 2021 and from Production environments on March 31, 2021</b>.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2021, Workfront released a change to existing proof workflows in both Workfront Classic and the new Workfront experience. The change allowed for an existing workflow to carry over to any new proof versions created by a user, regardless of the method used to generate them.</p>
<p>In the new Workfront experience after this change is removed, proofs created with the Simple proof selection will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.</p>
<p>In Workfront Classic after this change is removed, the option to Generate Proof will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.</p>
<p>Similar functionality to easily copy existing workflows might be added to Production at a future time.</p>
</div>
