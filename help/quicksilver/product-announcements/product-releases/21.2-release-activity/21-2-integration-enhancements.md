# 21.2 Integration enhancements

These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of May 10, 2021.

## Introducing Adobe Workfront for XD

We're excited to announce the launch of our new plugin: Adobe Workfront for XD. This plugin allows you to access work item details, collaborate with coworkers in the Updates area, and submit proofs for review--all without leaving XD. Head over to the Adobe XD marketplace to download the plugin today.

To learn more about what you can do with Adobe Workfront for XD, see [Manage work with the Adobe Workfront plugin for Creative Cloud Applications](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/adobe-workfront-for-creative-cloud/wf-cc-manage-work-toc.md).


## Search for folders in document integrations

To make it easier for you to navigate your document integrations, we've made it possible to search for folders. Now, when you enter a term in the search bar, Workfront will return documents, folders, and subfolders that contain the search term in their names.

Previously, subfolders could only be located by opening the parent folders.

For more information, see [Link documents from external applications](../../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

## Enhanced security when uploading files to Google Drive

The Google Drive integration now supports new Google security protocols.

When linking to, uploading, or creating files on Google Drive from the Documents section of a Adobe Workfront object, Workfront now accesses your Google files through Google's file picker. This limits Workfront's access and visibility only to those Google files that you link to Workfront.

Previously, files were accessed through a file dialog based in Workfront.
