## Functionality being removed from Production

### Feature rollback: Carry over the existing proof workflow when generating a new version

Due to customer feedback, **Workfront is removing this change from Preview environments on March 30, 2021 and from Production environments on March 31, 2021**.

On March 11, 2021, Workfront released a change to existing proof workflows in both Workfront Classic and the new Workfront experience. The change allowed for an existing workflow to carry over to any new proof versions created by a user, regardless of the method used to generate them.

In the new Workfront experience after this change is removed, proofs created with the Simple proof selection will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.

In Workfront Classic after this change is removed, the option to Generate Proof will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.

Similar functionality to easily copy existing workflows might be added to Production at a future time.

## Functionality no longer supported

### Internet Explorer 11

With the removal of support for Internet Explorer, Workfront now officially supports Microsoft Edge.

For more information about supported browsers, see [Adobe Workfront browser requirements](../../../workfront-basics/workfront-browser-requirements.md).
