# 21.2 Requests enhancements

This page describes all Requests enhancements made with the 21.2 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of May 10, 2021. For a list of all changes available with the 21.2 release, see [21.2 Release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/21.2-release-activity/21-2-release-overview.md).

## Control what type of assignments you make on a new request

>[!NOTE]
>
>Available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

We have changed the way the Assignments field functions when creating a new request to provide consistency and always show the same field regardless of what types of assignments users can enter.

When you enable the Assigned To, Job Role, or Team fields to be visible when setting up a request queue, requestors will see the same Assignments field that can accommodate all or any of these three assignment types.

There is an indication in the Assignments field about which types of assignments are allowed. For example, when you enabled the Assigned To and Team fields when setting up the request queue, you will be prompted to “Search people or teams” instead of “Search people, roles, or teams.”

For more information, see the following articles:

* [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](create-submit-requests.md) 
* [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md)

## Improvements to creating requests and managing drafts

>[!NOTE]
>
>Available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

As we continue to incorporate your feedback about creating requests in the new Workfront experience, we made several improvements to the new requests workflow. These include:

* Clearly indicate with a Show options icon that the fields for Request Types, Topic Groups, and Queue Topics are drop-down lists from which you can choose an option that was previously defined.
* Clearly indicate with an “x” icon that a choice for Request Type, Topic Group, or Queue Topic can be removed after it’s been selected.
* Provide a Close button when creating a new request to leave the request without losing the draft. In addition to this change, the “Discard” button has been renamed to “Discard draft.”

For information about creating new requests, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](create-submit-requests.md).

## Improvements to the requests workflow

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience

As we continue to listen to and incorporate your feedback, we have added several improvements to the new requests workflow to make your interaction with Adobe Workfront easier and more intuitive. These improvements are:

* You can select where to place the Documents section for uploading files when creating a request queue as you are defining the Queue Setup. You can place this section either before or after the custom fields of the request form. For more information, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).
* Sorting the Submitted requests list by one of the columns is now preserved when you navigate away from the page. For more information, see [Locate submitted requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/locate-submitted-requests.md).
* When creating a new request, the Submit and Cancel buttons are now located at the bottom of the New request form. For more information, see [Create and submit Workfront requests](create-submit-requests.md).

## Open Summary Panel in the Submitted section of the Requests area

>[!NOTE]

>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

To make your experience consistent across all areas of Adobe Workfront, we have added the Open Summary icon to the Submitted section of the Requests area. Now, you can open the Summary panel for submitted issues and see more information about the issues, assign them, or add a document or a comment.

For information about the submitted requests, see [Locate submitted requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/locate-submitted-requests.md).

## Bring back removed New Issue Fields on a New Request form

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

With the redesign of the New Request form that launched with the previous release, we had prevented several fields from the New Issue Fields area of the project Queue Details section to display when submitting a new request. After incorporating your feedback, we have decided to bring the fields back so they can all display on the New Request form.

For information, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

## New experience when submitting requests in the Requests area

>[!NOTE]
>
>Added to Preview with the 21.1 release, but will be included in the 21.2 release to Production.

To bring consistency with the new Workfront experience and create efficiencies for you when submitting requests, we have redesigned the New Request box in the Requests area. The following are some of the improvements:

* A consisted user interface with the rest of the the new Workfront experience
* Eliminated the New Requests area for an easier and more intuitive experience
* A new, more efficient way of attaching documents to your requests

Ability to share a link to the request queue, topic group, or queue topic as you enter the request.

For information about submitting requests, see [Create and submit Workfront requests](create-submit-requests.md).

## Share a link to a request queue when submitting a request

>[!NOTE]

>Added to Preview with the 21.1 release, but will be included in the 21.2 release to Production.

We have now made it possible to share a link to a request queue, topic group, or queue topic As you create a request.

Before you submit a new request, you can copy a link to the request queue, topic group, or queue topic of the request and share it with other users, or embed it in a dashboard.

For information about sharing a link to a request queue when submitting a request, see [Share a link to a request queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/share-link-to-request-queue.md).
