## Open Summary Panel in the Submitted section of the Requests area

To make your experience consistent across all areas of Adobe Workfront, we have added the Open Summary icon to the Submitted section of the Requests area. Now, you can open the Summary panel for submitted issues and see more information about the issues, assign them, or add a document or a comment.

For information about the submitted requests, see [Locate submitted requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/locate-submitted-requests.md).

## Custom forms enhancement

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

For a better experience when you fill out a custom form, we have improved the way that long custom field labels display. When there is enough horizontal space to show them in their entirety, these labels are no longer truncated.

For information about filling out custom forms, see [Edit information in custom form fields in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/edit-custom-forms.md).
