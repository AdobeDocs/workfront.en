# 23.1 Project and Resource Management enhancements

This page describes all Project and Resource Management enhancements made with the 23.1 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of January 16, 2023.

For a list of all changes available with the 23.1 release, see [23.1 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.1-release-activity/23-1-release-overview.md).

## Secondary job roles added to the Other Assignments list when bulk assigning items in the Workload Balancer

When bulk assigning users in the Workload Balancer after selecting a job role in the "Role assignment" field, the list of users that populates in the "Other Assignments" list in the "User to assign" field will now display all the job roles associated with each user under their name. Prior to this enhancement, only the user's primary role displayed.   

For more information, see [Assign work in bulk using the Workload Balancer](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/assign-work-in-workload-balancer-in-bulk.md).

## Relocation of the "Add users" option on a project

In preparation for the deprecation and removal of the Resource Scheduling tools, we have relocated the "Add users" option from the Scheduling section of a project to the People section. When adding users to a project, the users who are not associated with items on the project become part of the Project Team.

For more information, see [Manage the Project Team](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/manage-project-team.md).

## Copy a direct link for a document folder

You can now copy and share document folder links to provide quick access to the folder. Users must have at least View access to the object to view the folder.

For more information, see [Copy and share a link to a document folder](/help/quicksilver/documents/managing-documents/copy-a-doc-folder-url.md).
