# 23.1 Project enhancements

This page describes all Project enhancements made with the 23.1 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of January 16, 2023.

For a list of all changes available with the 23.1 release, see [23.1 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.1-release-activity/23-1-release-overview.md).

## Relocation of the "Add users" option on a project

In preparation for the deprecation and removal of the Resource Scheduling tools, we have relocated the "Add users" option from the Scheduling section of a project to the People section. When adding users to a project, the users who are not associated with items on the project become part of the Project Team.

For more information, see [Manage the Project Team](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/manage-project-team.md).

## Copy a direct link for a document folder

You can now copy and share document folder links to provide quick access to the folder. Users must have at least View access to the object to view the folder.

For more information, see [Copy and share a link to a document folder](/help/quicksilver/documents/managing-documents/copy-a-doc-folder-url.md).
