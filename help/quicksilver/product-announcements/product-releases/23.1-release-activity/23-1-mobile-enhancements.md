Adobe Workfront Boards are now available in the mobile app! You can access Boards directly from the home screen and see all of the boards you have access to in the desktop version of Workfront. In a specific board, you can view and edit all of its columns and cards. Card details include name, description, column, assignees, status, due date, estimation, tags, and checklist items. Both ad hoc and connected cards are visible on the board.

Additional features include:

* Add an ad hoc card to a column
* Select and drag cards between columns
* Search in the board
* Filter the board by member or tag
* View the intake column and move cards from the intake column onto the board

Any changes you make to columns and cards in the app are also reflected in the desktop version of the board. At this time, you can only open your desktop boards and cannot create new boards in the app.

The following articles will be updated when the app is released to the app stores:
