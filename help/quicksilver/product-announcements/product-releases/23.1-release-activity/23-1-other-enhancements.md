This page describes all other enhancements made with the 23.1 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available the week of January 16, 2023.

## New list control functionality in Interface > Filters, Views, and Groupings

We've added list control functionality to the Filters, Views, and Groupings pages in the Setup area. There, you can enable or disable filters, views, and groupings for the Layout Template.

## Introducing Adobe Workfront for design and video 

We're excited to announce the expansion of our Adobe Workfront for InDesign plugin to include Adobe Premiere Pro, and After Effects. The plugin will be renamed to Adobe Workfront for design and video. 

The updated plugin, Adobe Workfront for design and video, will now support InDesign, Premiere Pro, and After Effects—with Illustrator soon to follow. 

This plugin allows you to access work item details, collaborate with coworkers in the Updates area, and log time–all without leaving your favorite Creative Cloud application.  

 Download [Adobe Workfront for design and video](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/108938/adobe-workfront-for-design-and-video) in the marketplace today. 

Administrators can also create a package with the plugins from the Admin Console and deploy to users either in a managed or self-managed manner.

## How to access Workfront help, for customers on the Adobe Unified Experience

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature only applies to customers who are onboarded to the Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront.

If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console and the Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront, the Workfront navigation bar no longer includes a link for "Help."

You can access Workfront help on Adobe Experience League in two ways:

*    The Main Menu on the left of the Workfront navigation bar contains a help link at the bottom
*    The question mark icon in the top navigation area provides links to help, support, and feedback

For more information, see [Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/adobe-unified-experience.md) or [Access Adobe Workfront help](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/access-workfront-help.md).

## Rename pins and a new experience when deleting pins

The following updates are now available for pins:

* Rename existing pins

* An improved experience when deleting a pin

The options to rename a pin and remove a pin appear in a drop-down menu when you hover over the pin.

For more information, see [Pin pages to customize your workspace](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/pin-pages.md).
