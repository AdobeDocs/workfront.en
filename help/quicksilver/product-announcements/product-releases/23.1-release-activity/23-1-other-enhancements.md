# 23.1 Other enhancements

This page describes all other enhancements made with the 23.1 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of January 16, 2023. 

For a list of all changes available with the 23.1 release, see [23.1 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.1-release-activity/23-1-release-overview.md).

## Introducing the addition of Illustrator to the Adobe Workfront for design and video plugin 

We're excited to announce the expansion of our Adobe Workfront for InDesign plugin to include Adobe Illustrator. 

The updated plugin, Adobe Workfront for design and video, will now support InDesign, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and After Effects.  

This plugin allows you to access work item details, collaborate with coworkers in the Updates area, and log time–all without leaving your favorite Creative Cloud application. 

Download [Adobe Workfront for design and video](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/108938/adobe-workfront-for-design-and-video) in the Marketplace today.

Administrators can also [create a package with the plugins](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/enterprise/using/manage-extensions.html) from the Admin Console and deploy to users either in a managed or self-managed manner. 

## Enhanced filter experience generally available in Adobe Workfront

An upgrade to the filter experience was released to public beta on project, task, and issue lists in August 2022. Most lists now offer the enhanced filters. (To review all of these lists, see the [23.1 look-and-feel updates release note](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.1-release-activity/23-1-look-and-feel-updates.md).)

As a "fast follow" to the 23.1 release, the enhanced filter experience will be generally available and become the standard filter builder in the February/March 2023 timeframe.

The following will be available in Workfront before the enhanced filters are generally available:

* Global filter setup capability will be added to the filters setup page
* The ability to add and delete system default filters will be added to layout templates
* List controls will be deprecated

These features fix issues related to curated filter lists not appearing correctly in the public beta filters.

You can still access the legacy filters on lists by enabling them in the filter panel. Legacy filters will be deprecated from lists in the future, but they will remain available in reports because the enhanced filters are not available in reports.

For details about the enhanced filters and a video demonstration, see the [filters public beta release note](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/22.4-release-activity/22-4-project-enhancements.md).

## New list control functionality in Interface > Filters, Views, and Groupings

We've added list control functionality to the Filters, Views, and Groupings pages in the Setup area. There, you can enable or disable filters, views, and groupings for the Layout Template.

For more information, see [Create, edit, and share default filters, views, and groupings](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/create-and-share-default-fvgs.md).

## Introducing Adobe Workfront for design and video 

We're excited to announce the expansion of our Adobe Workfront for InDesign plugin to include Adobe Premiere Pro, and After Effects. The plugin will be renamed to Adobe Workfront for design and video. 

The updated plugin, Adobe Workfront for design and video, will now support InDesign, Premiere Pro, and After Effects—with Illustrator soon to follow. 

This plugin allows you to access work item details, collaborate with coworkers in the Updates area, and log time–all without leaving your favorite Creative Cloud application.  

 Download [Adobe Workfront for design and video](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/108938/adobe-workfront-for-design-and-video) in the marketplace today. 

Administrators can also [create a package with the plugins](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/enterprise/using/manage-extensions.html) from the Admin Console and deploy to users either in a managed or self-managed manner.

## How to access Workfront help, for customers on the Adobe Unified Experience

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature only applies to customers who are onboarded to the Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront.

If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console and the Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront, the Workfront navigation bar no longer includes a link for "Help."

You can access Workfront help on Adobe Experience League in two ways:

*    The Main Menu on the left of the Workfront navigation bar contains a help link at the bottom
*    The question mark icon in the top navigation area provides links to help, support, and feedback

For more information, see [Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/adobe-unified-experience.md) or [Access Adobe Workfront help](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/access-workfront-help.md).

## Rename pins and a new experience when deleting pins

The following updates are now available for pins:

* Rename existing pins

* An improved experience when deleting a pin

The options to rename a pin and remove a pin appear in a drop-down menu when you hover over the pin.

For more information, see [Pin pages to customize your workspace](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/pin-pages.md).
