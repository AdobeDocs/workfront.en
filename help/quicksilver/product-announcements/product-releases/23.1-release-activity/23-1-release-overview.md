### Functionality soon to be removed from Workfront

The following functionality is soon to be removed from Workfront:

#### **Deprecation and removal of the Campaigns (Beta) area from the Preview environment**

We are removing the Campaigns (Beta) area from the Preview environment on January 9, 2023. Our Product team is going to review this functionality and include it in a future product release.

At this time, we are making the following changes:

* Remove the Campaigns (Beta) area from the Main Menu and from the Layout templates in the Preview environment. 
* Remove the Campaigns (Beta) area from the Main Menu and from the Layout Templates in the Production environment for those customers who had it enabled by request. 

Additionally, all articles describing this functionality will also be removed.

#### **List Controls (from the Interface area in Setup)**

List Controls in Setup > Interface will be removed with the 23.1 release. 

Some list control functionality is moving to the Setup > Interface > Filters/Views/Grouping areas. For more information, see [Create, edit, and share default filters, views, and groupings](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/create-and-share-default-fvgs.md).

#### **Workfront extension for Illustrator and InDesign**
 
We are replacing the [Workfront extension for Illustrator and InDesign](/help/quicksilver/documents/workfront-for-adobe-creative-cloud/use-wf-adobe-cc.md) with updated Creative Cloud plugins. Starting late 2022, this extension will no longer be available to install in the Adobe Exchange.
 
The functionality in this extension, along with several enhancements, is available in the updated Adobe Workfront for Creative Cloud Plugins:
* [Adobe Workfront for Photoshop](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/adobe-workfront-for-creative-cloud/wf-cc-install-ps.md)
* [Adobe Workfront for XD](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/adobe-workfront-for-creative-cloud/wf-adobe-xd-install.md)
* [Adobe Workfront for design and video](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/adobe-workfront-for-creative-cloud/wf-install-cc.md)

#### **Resource Scheduler**

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Resource Scheduler was removed from the Preview environment on October 20. It will be removed from the Production environment with the 23.1 release in January 2023.


As part of the deprecation of the Resource Scheduling tools, we have removed the following areas: 

* The Scheduling section in Resourcing area of the Main Menu 

* The Schedule section of a team's page 

* The Scheduling section of a project's page 
  
The Workload Balancer is replacing the Resource Scheduler. 

#### **The SHARE event type in the Event Subscriptions API.** 
  
>[!NOTE]
>
>  This feature has been deprecated when creating new subscriptions and will be removed in January 2023.

  This event type allowed customers to watch when permissions for objects were updated.

  For more information about Event Subscriptions, as well as other event types that will continue to be supported, see [Event Subscription API](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/general/event-subs-api.md)
