#### Workfront extension for Illustrator and InDesign
 
We are replacing the [Workfront extension for Illustrator and InDesign](/help/quicksilver/documents/workfront-for-adobe-creative-cloud/workfront-for-adobe-creative-loud.md) with updated Creative Cloud plugins. Starting late 2022, this extension will no longer be available to install in the Adobe Exchange.
 
The functionality in this extension, along with several enhancements, is available in the updated Adobe Workfront for Creative Cloud Plugins:
* [Adobe Workfront for Photoshop](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/adobe-workfront-for-creative-cloud/wf-cc-install-ps.md)
* [Adobe Workfront for XD](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/adobe-workfront-for-creative-cloud/wf-adobe-xd-install.md)

#### **Resource Scheduler**

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Resource Scheduler was removed from the Preview environment on October 20. It will be removed from the Production environment with the 23.1 release in January 2022.


As part of the deprecation of the Resource Scheduling tools, we have removed the following areas: 

* The Scheduling section in Resourcing area of the Main Menu 

* The Schedule section of a team's page 

* The Scheduling section of a project's page 
  
The Workload Balancer is replacing the Resource Scheduler. For more information about the deprecation and how you can prepare to use the Workload Balancer, see the following resources:

#### **The SHARE event type in the Event Subscriptions API.** 
  
>[!NOTE]
>
>  This feature has been deprecated when creating new subscriptions and will be removed in January 2023.

  This event type allowed customers to watch when permissions for objects were updated.
