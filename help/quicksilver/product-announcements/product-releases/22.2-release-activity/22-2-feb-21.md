Undo option for Update posts It is now easier to catch mistakes when posting an update. Finalizing a comment in an object's Update tab now creates a pop-up window for 7 seconds that allows you to cancel the post and return to editing--before the system timestamps it or sends any emails or in-app notifications. If you dismiss the pop-up window, leave the page, or wait 7 seconds for the window to disappear, the post is made normally. For more information, see Update work.

## Adobe Creative Cloud integrations now use OAuth2

For greater security, and to make a more consistent experience across integrations, we've updated the Adobe Creative Cloud integrations to use OAuth2 authentication, an industry-standard way to authenticate users. Now, when your users log in, they can see the specific actions and areas that the integrations have access to, and allow access. After this, they do not need to log in as frequently.
