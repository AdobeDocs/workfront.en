## Enhancements to top navigation bar

We have made several enhancements to the Adobe Workfront top navigation bar.

* Favorites and Recents now have separate icons in the top navigation bar. Each still displays the same content (pages you have marked as favorites, and pages you have visited recently), and you can continue to add and remove favorite pages in the same way.
* The look and feel of both pins and the main menu was updated to Adobe design standards, including colors and fonts. The way you add and remove pins and the areas you have access to in your main menu have not changed.
* The icons on the right of the top navigation bar were re-ordered to be more intuitive. The icon order is: help link, notifications, favorites, recents, search, main menu.

For more information, see [Top navigation bar overview](../../../workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/global-navigation-overview.md).

## Redesigned timesheet lists

To make your use of Workfront consistent with the new Adobe Workfront experience, we have redesigned the timesheet lists in the Timesheets area. You can expect the same functionality in the timesheet list, only with a cleaner, more streamlined user experience.

Some of the highlights of this redesign are:

* The timesheet list now matches the experience in all other lists in Workfront.
* The filter experience now matches the filters in all other lists. You will have more flexibility to create your own filters with the fields and attributes that make the most sense to you as well as share them with other users.

For more information about creating timesheets using the new lists, see [Create a single-use timesheet](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-tmshts.md).
