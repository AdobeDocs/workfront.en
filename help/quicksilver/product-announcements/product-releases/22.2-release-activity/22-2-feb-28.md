## See details of the Client Secret for custom OAuth2 or JWT integrations

To provide transparency into the use of your custom OAuth2 and JWT integrations, we've made it possible for you to see details of the Client Secrets your integrations use. Now, you can see the dates that the Client Secret was created and last used. You can also add and view your own notes about the Client Secret.

Previously, these details were unavailable.

For more information on Client Secrets in OAuth2 or JWT custom integrations, see [Create OAuth2 applications for Workfront integrations](../../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/create-oauth-application.md).
