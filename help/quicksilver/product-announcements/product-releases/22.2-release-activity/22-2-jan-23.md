## For administrators: New default access level configurations

To better suit the needs of most administrators who create new access levels, we have changed the default configuration for the following “Fine-tune your settings” options. These display when you click the gear icon ![](assets/gear-icon-in-access-levels.png) on an Edit button.

All six of these changes disable an option that was previously enabled by default. If this doesn’t suit the needs of your organization, you can always enable them when you are setting up a new access level, or any time thereafter.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This default configuration change affects only access levels that you create from now on, not any that you created previously.
