# 20.3 Proof enhancements

This page describes all proof enhancements made with the 20.3 release to the Production environment. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment the week of August 10, 2020.

For a list of all changes available with the 20.3 release, see [20.3 release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/20.3-release-activity/20-3-release-overview.md).

## Improved visibility between the Updates tab and Proof comments

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience

The following improvements are available in the documents area:

* When a proof comment displays in the Update tab, a new Reply in Proof button appears allowing you to go into the proofing viewer to reply.
* When a proof comment is tagged with an action inside the proofing viewer, the action displays in the Update tab.

For more information, see [Add an update to a document](../../../documents/managing-documents/add-update-documents.md).

## Update proofing custom fields in Document Details

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience

To streamline the proofing process, you can now see and edit custom fields set up in Workfront Proof on the Document Details page in Workfront if you're included on the proof workflow.

Previously, you could only view custom fields in the proofing viewer.

For more information, see [Document Details overview](../../../documents/managing-documents/document-details-overview.md).

## New look for the Document toolbar

The toolbar in the Document area now has the same look and feel as the toolbar for projects, tasks, and issues in the new Workfront experience.

In addition, the New Version option is now under the Add new drop-down menu in both the new Workfront experience and Classic.

## Create an advanced proof from the document list

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience

To make it easier to set up a workflow when turning an existing document in a proof, use the new Create Proof drop-down menu to configure the proof workflow from the document list.

Previously, you had to generate the proof, then go into the Proofing Workflow area to set up the workflow.

For more information, see [Create a proof for a document](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof-for-a-document.md).
