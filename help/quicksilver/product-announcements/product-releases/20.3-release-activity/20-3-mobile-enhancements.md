This page describes all integration and mobile enhancements made with the 20.3 release to the Production environment. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment the week of August 10, 2020.

## Workfront Fusion 2.0 is here!

Workfront recently acquired technology for a completely new generation of Workfront Fusionâ€•the powerful integration platform that lets work flow freely across virtually any web-based application.

Previous Workfront Fusion customers can expect greater power, speed, usability, and predictability in Workfront Fusion 2.0. We are in the process of migrating current Workfront Fusion customers to Workfront Fusion 2.0. Please contact your account executive for more details.

## Introducing Workfront for MobileIron

Workfront has partnered with MobileIron, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform, to provide organizations a more secure and controlled mobile experience.

With Workfront for MobileIron, administrators can restrict things like copy/paste functionality and screen captures. You can download the Workfront for MobileIron app at [https://marketplace.mobileiron.com/listing/workfront](https://marketplace.mobileiron.com/listing/workfront).

Voice commands

Here are some examples of voice commands you can use to interact with the mobile app:

* Show me my late items
