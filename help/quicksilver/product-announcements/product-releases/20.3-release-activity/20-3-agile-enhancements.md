# 20.3 Agile enhancements

This page describes all Agile enhancements made with the 20.3 release to the Production environment. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment the week of August 10, 2020.

For a list of all changes available with the 20.3 release, see [20.3 release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/20.3-release-activity/20.3-release-overview.md).

## Choose how long cards stay on the Kanban board

Now, you can choose how long Completed cards stay on the Kanban board.

Previously, cards dropped off the Kanban board after 14 days.

For more information, see [Configure Kanban](../../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-kanban.md).

## Agile boards load 50 work items at a time

To increase the speed and performance of the agile tools, up to 50 cards now load in various locations. If there are more than 50 work items on an agile board, a button appears at the bottom of the board or backlog, allowing you to load additional work items.
