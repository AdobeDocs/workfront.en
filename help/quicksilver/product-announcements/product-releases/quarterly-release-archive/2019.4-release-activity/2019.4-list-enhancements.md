     <strong>New tooltip added to quick filters</strong> 
     <p> Instead of using your browser's native functionality for finding an item in a list, you can use quick filters in all the redesigned lists. To make finding the quick filter easier, a new tooltip now directs you to the quick filter.</p> 
     <p>Now, when you click CTRL+F or CMD+F on your keyboard, a tooltip appears next to the quick filter in a list to indicate that instead of those native commands you can instead use the quick filter to find an item in the list. The shortcuts for launching the quick filter are different than the browser shortcut and they display in the search box of the filter.</p> 
     <p>For information about using quick filters in lists, see the section "Apply quick filters to lists" in the article <a href="../../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/view-items-in-a-list.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Get started with lists in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront</a>.</p>

     <strong>New shortcuts for quick filters</strong> 
     <p>Keyboard shortcut reminders are now available inside the search box of quick filters in lists to make it easier for you to access the filters. </p> 
     <p>The shortcuts are:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><strong>On Windows (Internet Explorer only):</strong>&nbsp;ALT+Shift+F</li> 
      <li><strong>On Mac (all browsers):</strong>&nbsp;Option+F</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Quick filters are available in all redesigned lists.
