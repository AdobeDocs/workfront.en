   <td> <strong>Add a filter to a Typeahead field in a custom form</strong> <p>Now, when you add a Typeahead field to a custom form, you can add a filter to limit the objects that are available when someone uses the field. For example, you could limit the field so that the user can select only members of the Marketing and Sales teams in your organization.</p> <p>For more information, see the section Create and add a new field in the article Creating Custom Forms.</p>

     <strong>Change the display type of a field in a custom form</strong> 
     <p>Now you can change the display type of a field in a custom form.</p> 
     <p>For example, if you have created a Checkboxes field, you can change it to a Dropdown field or a Radio Buttons field. These three field display types are interchangeable.</p> 
     <p>Or, if you have created a Single Line Text Field, you can change it to a Paragraph Text field. These two field display types are interchangeable.</p> 
     <p>Previously, to change the display type of a custom field, you had to create a new field and delete the old one. This required transferring data, which was often time consuming.</p>
