## Updated Look and Feel with Basecamp Integration in Workfront Proof {#updated-look-and-feel-with-basecamp-integration-in-workfront-proof}

The look and feel of the Basecamp integration with Workfront Proof is now updated. Functionality remains the same.

## Paste Images to Workfront from the Clipboard {#paste-images-to-workfront-from-the-clipboard}

You can now add image files to Workfront by pasting an image from your system clipboard.

The ability to paste from the clipboard was removed from Workfront in a previous release; it is being re-introduced with this release. The new method is more streamlined and intuitive.

For more information, see [Paste images from the Clipboard](../../../../documents/managing-documents/paste-image-clipboard.md).&nbsp;

## Utilization Report Improvements {#utilization-report-improvements}

The Utilization report contains the following improvements:

* View Revenue in the Utilization report on a project

  Allows you to view the Budgeted Revenue, Planned Revenue, Actual Revenue, Budgeted Variance, and Planned Variance.

* Compare Revenue against Planned and Actual Costs

  Allows you to view the Planned or Actual Cost alongside the Planned Revenue. The Margin (%) is also displayed (margin is calculated as Revenue - Cost / Revenue).

* Revenue is displayed when viewing the chart.
* Headers remain visible when scrolling.

  Now when scrolling through information in the Utilization report, the header at the top of the Utilization report is always visible, allowing you to more easily understand the data in the report.

  Previously, the header at the top of the Utilization report would move out of view when scrolling.

* Utilization report on an individual project loads automatically

  When viewing the Utilization report on a project, the report loads automatically.

  Prior to this change, you had to click "Run" before the report ran.

* Improved performance

For more information about the Utilization report, see [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md).

## Remove the Resource Budgeted Hour Object from Workfront {#remove-the-resource-budgeted-hour-object-from-workfront}

To address performance issues, the Resource Budgeted Hour field was temporarily removed from Workfront.

As a reminder, the Resource Budgeted Hours are the hours that you budget for your resources or your projects in the Resource Planner. For the time being, you can no longer report on this field in the web application or through the API. The field will be reinstated in a future release, when the performance issues have been resolved.

For more information about budgeting hours in the Resource Planner, see [Resource Planner overview](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).&nbsp;

## Report Usage Statistics {#report-usage-statistics}

You can now display the following usage information for your Workfront reports in a list of reports:

* Last Viewed By
* Last View Date
* Last 10 Viewers
* Views This Month/ Quarter/ Year
* Views Last Month/ Quarter/ Year
* All Views

Prior to this update, you were limited in what usage information you could see on your reports.

For more information about report usage, see [View report usage](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/report-usage/view-report-usage.md)

## Schedules Managed by group administrators {#schedules-managed-by-group-administrators}

As a group administrator, you can create and edit schedules associated with the groups you administer, as well as their subgroups. Prior to this change, only Workfront administrators could create and edit schedules.

For more information on managing schedules, see [Create a schedule](../../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md)

## Gantt Chart Updates {#gantt-chart-updates}

The Gantt chart is now editable. Using the Gantt chart, you can make the following updates on your tasks:

* Create predecessor relationships
* Edit task duration
* Update the task percent complete
* Apply resource leveling

Prior to this change, you could only remove predecessor relationships in the Gantt chart and you could edit tasks only in the task list.

For more information on the Gantt chart, see [Update information in the task list Gantt Chart](../../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/update-info-task-list-gantt.md)

## New Portfolio Optimizer {#new-portfolio-optimizer}

The Portfolio Optimizer area of Workfront is now updated with a new look and feel. The functionality has not changed.

For more information about the Portfolio Optimizer, see [Portfolio Optimizer overview](../../../../manage-work/portfolios/portfolio-optimizer/portfolio-optimizer-overview.md)

## Budget Date Adjustment Option in the Resource Planner {#budget-date-adjustment-option-in-the-resource-planner}

We have added an option to give you quick visibility into time frames without budgeting conflicts. After you view when the time frames without budgeting conflicts occur, you can manually move your Budgeted Hours to those times. This will also adjust the Budgeted Dates of the hours. Prior to this update, viewing budgeting conflicts for a project at a glance was not possible. 

For more information about adjusting budgeted dates in the Resource Planner, see the "Adjusting Budgeting Dates" section in the [Resource Planner overview](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md)

## Resource Scheduling: Restrict Assignments to Users Based on Group Membership {#resource-scheduling-restrict-assignments-to-users-based-on-group-membership}

When making user assignments in the Scheduling area (as described in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md)), you can now configure Workfront to restrict assignments of tasks and issues only to those users who are members of the group that is defined on the project where the task or issue originates.&nbsp;

This applies when making assignments in the following ways:

* When assigning a user to all tasks and issues for a specific role, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md) in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

  Prior to this change, a task or issue could always be assigned to any user regardless of that user's group membership.&nbsp;

* When swapping assignments with another user, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md) in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

  Prior to this change, a task or issue could always be assigned to any user regardless of that user's group membership.&nbsp;

* When manually assigning a task or issue from the scheduling timeline, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md)&nbsp;in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

  Prior to this change, a task or issue could always be assigned to any user regardless of that user's group membership.&nbsp;

* When allowing Workfront to automatically assign users, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md) in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).&nbsp;

  Prior to this change, Workfront would assign tasks and issues to users regardless of group membership.

For more information about configuring this option,&nbsp;see [Get started with Resource Scheduling](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/get-started-resource-scheduling.md) in [Get started with Resource Scheduling](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/get-started-resource-scheduling.md).

## Resource Scheduling: Allow Assignments to Users Regardless of Role {#resource-scheduling-allow-assignments-to-users-regardless-of-role}

When making user assignments in the Scheduling area (as described in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md)), you can now configure Workfront to&nbsp;allow tasks and issues to be assigned to any user, regardless of whether that user has a role defined on their user profile that matches the role assignment of the task or issue that is being assigned to them.

This applies when making assignments in the following ways:

* When assigning a user to all tasks and issues for a specific role, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md) in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

  Prior to this change, the primary role of the user you are assigning had to match the role already defined in the Select Role field.

* When swapping assignments with another user, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md) in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

  Prior to this change, the primary role of the user you are assigning had to match the role already defined in the Select Role field.

* When manually assigning a task or issue from the scheduling timeline, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md)&nbsp;in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

  Prior to this change, only users whose role matched the role of the task or issue you were assigning were displayed on the scheduling timeline.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This does not apply when allowing Workfront to automatically assign users, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md) in&nbsp; [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md). When automatically assigning users, tasks and issues can be assigned only to users with a matching role.

For more information about configuring this option, see [Get started with Resource Scheduling](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/get-started-resource-scheduling.md) in [Get started with Resource Scheduling](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/get-started-resource-scheduling.md).

## Emoji Support {#emoji-support}

Now you can set the tone for comments and updates you make in Workfront by inserting emojis. Any emojis added to comments made on the Updates tab also display in the update email notification.&nbsp;

For more information see, [Update work](../../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).
