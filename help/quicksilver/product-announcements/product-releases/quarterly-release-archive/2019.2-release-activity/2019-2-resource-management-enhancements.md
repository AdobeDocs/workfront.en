# 2019.2 Resource Management enhancements

This page describes all Resource Management enhancements included with the 2019.2 release. The functionality is planned to be available in the Production environment the week of May 20, 2019.

For a list of all changes made in 2019.2, see [2019.2 Release Activity Overview](../../../../product-announcements/product-releases/quarterly-release-archive/2019.2-release-activity/2019-2-release-activity-overview.md).

## Display Portfolio Priority in the Resource Planner

You can now enable a setting in the Resource Planner that allows you to display the priority of the project according to the portfolio that it is assigned to. The portfolio priority displays next to the Resource Planner priority of the project.

Prior to this enhancement, you could not view the portfolio priority of a project in the Resource Planner.

For information about enabling this setting, see the [Settings](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planner-navigation.md#settings) section of the [Understanding the Areas of the Resource Planner](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planner-navigation.md).

## Share Filters in the Resource Planner

You can now share filters you create in the Resource Planner with select users, teams, groups, job roles, or companies.

Prior to this enhancement, filters you created were visible to all users who could access the Resource Planner.

For information about filtering in the Resource Planner, see [Filtering Content in the Resource Planner](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/filter-resource-planner.md).

## New Resource Management Access Level

We are introducing a new level of access for Resource Management. Users with a Plan License will be able to receive Edit access to Resource Management which will allow them to do the following:

* Prioritize projects in the Resource Planner
* Budget resources in the Resource Planning tools
* Manage Resource Pools

Users with a Work and Review license will have access to View for this level of access.

With this change, managing Resource Pools is now part of the Resource Management access level. Prior to this update, the access to manage Resource Pools was listed as part of the administrative access for the Planner license.

Also with this change, being designated as a Resource Manager on a project is no longer required; however, having the correct access to Resource Management is required to be able to manage resources.

For information about the new access required for budgeting resources, see [Access Needed to Budget Resources](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/access-needed-to-budget-resources.md).

For information about the new Resource Management access level, see [Understanding Resource Management Access](../../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-resource-management.md).

## Order Projects by Portfolio Priorities in the Resource Planner

You can now order projects by their portfolio priority in the Resource Planner.

Prior to this enhancement, you could only view the portfolio priority in the Resource Planner and order the projects only by their planner priority.

For information about ordering projects by portfolio priority in the Resource Planner, see [Prioritizing Projects in the Resource Planner](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/prioritize-projects-resource-planner.md).

## Resource Planner Filter Improvement

The filtering experience in the Resource Planner is now more simple when you add a new field (Group) to the built-in filter criteria. You can now find the most used filters in the built-in options.

For information about filters in the Resource Planner, see [Filtering Content in the Resource Planner](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/filter-resource-planner.md).
