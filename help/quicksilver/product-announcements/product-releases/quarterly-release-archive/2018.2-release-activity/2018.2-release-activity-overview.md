### Microsoft Outlook Add-in Support Is Ending {#microsoft-outlook-add-in-support-is-ending}

Workfront will no longer support the desktop version of the add-in after the 18.2 product release in July.

Now is the time to switch to Workfront for Outlook and become a productivity powerhouse! Instead of providing two distinct add-ins for Outlook, we now provide one universal add-in which can be used in any environment: on a PC, Mac, Desktop, Web, and even on the Outlook mobile app.

When you install the new Workfront for Outlook on any of your environments, your team can get more done, stay organized, and prioritize their work in real time.

Use the following resources to learn more about Workfront for Outlook and get started:

* [Website and video](https://www.workfront.com/integrations/outlook)&nbsp;
* [Using Workfront with Outlook](../../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-outlook/workfront-for-outlook.md)&nbsp;(help article)

### Removing Old API Versions {#removing-old-api-versions}

See the [API versioning and support schedule](../../../../wf-api/api/api-version-support-schedule.md) for more information.&nbsp;
