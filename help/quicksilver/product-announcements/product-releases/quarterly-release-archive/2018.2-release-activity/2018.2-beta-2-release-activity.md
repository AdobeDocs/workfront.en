## Edit Fields Directly from the Home Area {#edit-fields-directly-from-the-home-area}

Now when you select an object in the Home area, you can edit fields associated with that object directly from the right panel of the Home area.&nbsp;

Prior to this change, information could only be viewed in the Home area, not edited.

For more information, see the [Update or edit a work item in the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/update-and-edit-work-item-home.md) in the article&nbsp; [Update or edit a work item in the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/update-and-edit-work-item-home.md).

## Log Time in Days {#log-time-in-days}

Workfront administrators can now configure whether users in their organization log time in days or hours. Users with a Planner license can configure this setting for themselves.

Prior to this change, users could log time only in hours.

You can configure this setting by editing the user profile. For more information, see [Configure whether time is logged in hours or days](../../../../timesheets/config-timesheet-prefs/config-time-logged-hrs-days.md).

For information about how users can log time in days after this setting has been updated, see [Log time](../../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/log-time.md).

## View Cross-Project Predecessor Relationships on the Gantt Chart in a List of Projects {#view-cross-project-predecessor-relationships-on-the-gantt-chart-in-a-list-of-projects}

You can now view cross-project predecessor relationships on the Gantt chart in the following lists of projects:

* The Projects tab inside a portfolio or program
* In a Project Report

Prior to this change, you could view cross-project predecessor relationships only for individual tasks at the project level.

For more information, see [Configure how information displays on the Gantt Chart](../../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/configure-info-on-gantt-chart.md).&nbsp;

## Use Budgeted Cost in the Portfolio Optimizer to Calculate Portfolio Finances {#use-budgeted-cost-in-the-portfolio-optimizer-to-calculate-portfolio-finances}

The new Portfolio Optimizer now uses the Budgeted Cost from the new Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case or from the Resource Planner to calculate the following fields:

* Net Value
* Return on Investment (ROI)
* Cost

Previously, both the new and Legacy Portfolio Optimizer used the Legacy Budgeted Cost. The Legacy Portfolio Optimizer still uses the Legacy Budgeted Cost to calculate Net Value, Return on Investment, and Cost.

We have also added two new fields to the Portfolio Financial Fields: Legacy ROI and Legacy Net Value to capture the new values from the new resource management tools.

For more information, see [Portfolio Optimizer overview](../../../../manage-work/portfolios/portfolio-optimizer/portfolio-optimizer-overview.md) in the article&nbsp; [Portfolio Optimizer overview](../../../../manage-work/portfolios/portfolio-optimizer/portfolio-optimizer-overview.md).

## Utilization Report: Populates Budgeted Hours from New Resource Budgeting Area {#utilization-report-populates-budgeted-hours-from-new-resource-budgeting-area}

>[!NOTE]

>This functionality will not be included with the official release to the Preview environment with the 2018.2 release. It will be reintroduced during the beta period for the 2018.3 release, and will release to the Production environment with the 2018.3 release.&nbsp;

Budgeted Hours in the Utilization Report are now populated from information available in the new Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case.

Prior to this change, information from the legacy Resource Estimates area&nbsp;was used.

For more information, see [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md) in the article&nbsp; [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md).

## Utilization Report: View Budgeted Hours by User on a Project {#utilization-report-view-budgeted-hours-by-user-on-a-project}

The Utilization report on a project now displays Budgeted Hours by User.

Prior to this change, the Utilization report displayed Budgeted Hours only by job role.&nbsp;

For more information, see [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md) in the article [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md).

## Proof Progress from the Document List Available to Non-Proofing Users {#proof-progress-from-the-document-list-available-to-non-proofing-users}

Proof progress indicators (Sent, Opened, Comments Made, and Decision) are now displayed for all users when viewing the document list. This includes users who are not able to generate proofs (for more information about enabling users to generate proofs, see ection .

Prior to this change, proof progress indicators were available only for users who could generate proofs.

For more information, see [Proof progress and status overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/view-progress-status-proof.md).
