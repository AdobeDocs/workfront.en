## Calendar View in the Home Area {#calendar-view-in-the-home-area}

Now you can manage your personal work tasks and schedules using the Workfront Home Calendar view. The Home Calendar view allows you to do the following:

* Set your own schedule for accomplishing Workfront tasks assigned to you
* Quickly see the tasks that are coming due or overdue
* View your total allocated hours for a week
* Make updates to tasks assigned you

If you use a calendar in Outlook, you can integrate your calendar to display your Outlook events in your Home Calendar view.

For more information, see [Home Calendar view](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/home-calendar-view.md).

## Additional Updates to the Work List (Left Panel) in Home {#additional-updates-to-the-work-list-left-panel-in-home}

The following enhancements are now available for the Work List in the Home area:

* The number of completed items are now displayed in parenthesis next to the Completed option in the Filter drop-down menu.

  Previously, the number of completed items were not displayed in the Filter menu.&nbsp;

* Completed items are shown for the previous 2 weeks.

  Previously, completed items were shown for the previous 3 months.

  For information about viewing completed work in the Home area, see [Display items in the Work List in the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md) in the article [Display items in the Work List in the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).

* Add the Duration field and Assignments field to display when items are selected in the Home area.

  Previously, the Assignments field was available by default; however, if it was deleted, it could not be re-added. The Duration field was not previously available to add.

  For information about adding fields to the Home area, see "Creating and Managing Layout Templates."

For more information about using the Home area, see [Use the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-the-home-area.md).

## View User-Triggered Changes with Audit Logs {#view-user-triggered-changes-with-audit-logs}

We've created the following audit logs for Workfront administrators to track user-triggered changes:

* User Audit Log
* Access Level Audit Log
* Group Audit Logs
* Login Attempt Audit Logs

Previously, there was no way to track changes within the system.

For more information, see [View and export audit logs](../../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/view-and-export-audit-logs.md).

## View License Information as a group administrator {#view-license-information-as-a-group-administrator}

We've created a read-only Licenses page for group administrators to view license counts for the groups they administer.

Prior to this change, group administrators could not view license information.

For more information, see [Group administrators](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md).

## Configure Job Role Limits for Automated Resource Scheduling {#configure-job-role-limits-for-automated-resource-scheduling}

In the Automated Resource Scheduling settings, you can now assign a limit to a job role. This allows you to control the number of resources, with the same role, being assigned work.

Previously, you could not specify how many users within a certain job role could be assigned work.

For more information, see [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

## Project and Role View Improvements in the Resource Planner {#project-and-role-view-improvements-in-the-resource-planner}

The Project and Role Views of the Resource Planner now contain the following improvements:

* Improved filters which pull information from the entire database, rather than just the information on the screen.
* Full-screen mode.
* Performance is now faster and more efficient.

   * New limits for the number of projects, roles, and users that you can display.
   * Lazy loading, for faster loading of projects and roles.

* Quick access to Projects and Users directly from the Resource Planner.
* Faster drag-and-drop capability in the Project View, to prioritize your projects.

Prior to these improvements, you have reported that the Resource Planner was slow to load and that you had noticed incongruences in the data displayed. With these improvements, these should now be eliminated.

For information and to understand the new limits for the Resource Planner, see [Resource Planner display limitations](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planner-display-limitations.md)

## Resize Column Widths for Project Lists {#resize-column-widths-for-project-lists}

As we have been working on improving the functionality of our lists, we had temporarily disabled the ability to resize the widths of the columns in the following project lists:

* Projects I Own
* Projects I'm On
* All Projects

With this release, we can now again resize the columns of all project lists.

We have added additional improvements to this functionality.

Now, when you drag the right border of a column to resize it, the neighboring column to the right retains its size making the list wider, rather than also being modified. Also, you can drag the border of a column to the right past the borders of the neighboring columns.

Prior to this improvement, the neighboring column to the right of the resized column would proportionally be resized as well to fit on the screen and you could not drag the border of a column past the right border of the neighboring column. &nbsp;

For information about resizing the reordering columns in lists, see [Modify column width and order](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/modify-column-width-order.md).

To participate in our beta testing program for the current list improvements, see [New Lists Study.](http://community.workfront.com/discussions/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?GroupId=457&MessageKey=6b135c15-33dd-4fa2-8bc3-7cd7f7740c57&CommunityKey=0425cafc-f0ec-47fc-be20-a21dc073d520&tab=digestviewer&ReturnUrl=%2fdiscussions%2fcommunity-home%2fdigestviewer%3fCommunityKey%3d0425cafc-f0ec-47fc-be20-a21dc073d520) (Login required)

## Icon Support for the New Project Lists {#icon-support-for-the-new-project-lists}

As we have been working on improving the functionality of our lists, we had temporarily disabled displaying status icons in the following project lists:

* Projects I Own
* Projects I'm On
* All Projects

With this release, status icons can be displayed again in your projects lists for projects, or other objects in a project list.

For information about working in lists, see [Get started with lists in Adobe Workfront](../../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/view-items-in-a-list.md).

To participate in our current beta program and provide feedback on the functionality of the new project lists, see [New Lists Study.](https://community.workfront.com/discussions/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=6b135c15-33dd-4fa2-8bc3-7cd7f7740c57&CommunityKey=0425cafc-f0ec-47fc-be20-a21dc073d520&tab=digestviewer&memberkey=F45I7nzIn4YnrRMHxhR0hXfPcDD3ypdB0C8h6Qqq38WLONMtRSBkS17HsD%2FC%2FgZ6qRlxe8UZaWA%3D#bm6b135c15-33dd-4fa2-8bc3-7cd7f7740c57) (Login required)

## Add "Large Thumbnail" Field in Document Views {#add-large-thumbnail-field-in-document-views}

We are adding a new field called Large Thumbnail to a document view in a list or report. When selected in a document view, this field displays a 400 pixel-wide thumbnail of the document in a list or report.

Prior to this change, you could only add the Thumbnail field to a document view, which displays a 33-66 pixel-wide thumbnail of the document.

For information about fields in lists and reports, see [Glossary of Adobe Workfront terminology](../../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/workfront-terminology-glossary.md).

## Increase Excel Export Limit {#increase-excel-export-limit}

We have increased the limit for how many rows you can export in an Excel file. You can now export the following:

* 65,000 rows in an Excel .xls file
* 100,000 rows in an Excel .xlsx file

The new limits apply when you export the following from Workfront:

* A list or report from the web interface
* A list or report using the API
* A scheduled and delivered report

Prior to this improvement, you could only export 50,000 rows in any Excel file.

For information about exporting data from Workfront, see [Export data](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/export-data.md).

## Quick Filters for Project Lists {#quick-filters-for-project-lists}

You can now apply a quick filter to lists.

The purpose of a quick filter is to help you navigate directly to those items in your large lists that are of importance to you, so you can quickly review, update, or share them with others.

Currently, quick filters are available only for the project lists in the following sub-tabs:

* Projects I'm On
* Projects I Own
* All Projects

For information about quick filters, see the “Applying Quick Filters to Lists” section in [Get started with lists in Adobe Workfront](../../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/view-items-in-a-list.md).

## Reference Issue Collections in Project and Task Reports {#reference-issue-collections-in-project-and-task-reports}

You can now reference a collection of issues in a project or task view and filter. You can do so only using Text Mode while building a report.

Prior to this improvement, you were able to reference only a collection of tasks in a project view or filter.

For information about how to reference a collection in a report, see [Reference collections in a report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/reference-collections-report.md).

For information about using text mode, see&nbsp; [Overview of common uses for Text Mode](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-common-uses-text-mode.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the following video, the sample text mode for issue collections was incorrect. The correct sample text mode is available in [Reference collections in a report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/reference-collections-report.md).

## New More Robust Version Menu When Adding New Document Versions in Workfront {#new-more-robust-version-menu-when-adding-new-document-versions-in-workfront}

Now when adding new versions to documents in Workfront, the New Version menu contains additional options and is now consistent across areas of Workfront where you can add a new version.

You can add a new document version from the following areas of Workfront:

* From the More drop-down menu in the Documents tab.
* From the Document Actions menu on the document details page.
* From the All Versions tab on the document details page.

Prior to this change, only the More drop-down menu in the Documents tab contained all options for adding a new version.

The following options are now available&nbsp;in the New Version menu for all areas where you can add a new version:

* Proof 
* Document Only 
* Linked options (From Dropbox, From Google Drive, and so forth) 
* Paste from Clipboard (this is a new option when adding versions)

For more information, see [Add documents to Adobe Workfront from your file system](../../../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/add-documents-from-file-system.md) in the article [Add documents to Adobe Workfront from your file system](../../../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/add-documents-from-file-system.md).

## Mobile Improvements in the Android Beta Mobile App {#mobile-improvements-in-the-android-beta-mobile-app}

The following improvements will be available on the Android Beta version of the mobile app shortly after the day of this release:

* Swipe actions

  You can perform activities like volunteer to work for a task, complete a task, mark a notification as seen or new, text or call a contact by swiping various objects in the Workfront mobile app.

  The following areas have been improved with this functionality:

   * My Work and Home
   * Notifications
   * Contacts
   * Approvals

* New look and feel when viewing the Details tab of an item

  The interface has changed when viewing an item in the Android Beta version of the mobile app to make it easier to edit, complete it, or attach a document to it.   

* New experience when logging time

  Logging time is faster and easier than before, with an easier to access Log Time button, and a more streamlined interface for logging hours.

With this release, these improvements are only available for the Android Beta version of the Workfront mobile app. They are currently not available for iOS.

For information, see [Print a proof summary within Adobe Workfront](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/print-proof-summary-in-wf.md).

### Add Users to a Proof Directly from the proofing viewer {#add-users-to-a-proof-directly-from-the-proofing-viewer}

Now you can add users to a proof directly from the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer.&nbsp;

Previously, you could not add individual users to a proof. Rather, you could only copy the public URL or embed&nbsp;code.

For more information, see [Share a proof by adding users to it](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/share-a-proof-in-proofing-viewer.md#sharing-with-individual-users) in the article&nbsp; [Share a proof from the proofing viewer](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/share-a-proof-in-proofing-viewer.md).

### Display All Markup Tools in the proofing viewer {#display-all-markup-tools-in-the-proofing-viewer}

You can now configure the markup tool to display all the time rather than in a menu you have to open. This makes it faster to switch between tools. When configured in this way, markup tools are display horizontally at the top of the Web Proofing Viewer and Desktop Proofing Viewer.

Previously, markup tools were available only within a drop-down menu.

For more information about configuring this markup setting, see [Configure proofing viewer settings](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/configure-proofing-viewer-settings.md).

For more information about using markup options when reviewing a proof, see in the article .

### Configure Default Sorting Options in the proofing viewer {#configure-default-sorting-options-in-the-proofing-viewer}

Now when you change the sorting option within the comment list in a proof, that option becomes the default sorting option the next time you open any proof within the Web Proofing Viewer or Desktop Proofing Viewer.&nbsp;

For more information, see in the article&nbsp;.

### View Workfront Document Approvals in the Desktop Proofing Viewer {#view-workfront-document-approvals-in-the-desktop-proofing-viewer}

Now you can make a Workfront document approval decision in the Desktop Proofing Viewer.

Previously, only the Web Proofing Viewer allowed you to make a Workfront document approval decision.&nbsp;

For more information, see&nbsp; [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md)&nbsp;in the article&nbsp; [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md).

### Configure Links That Open New Tabs and Windows to Open within the Desktop Proofing Viewer {#configure-links-that-open-new-tabs-and-windows-to-open-within-the-desktop-proofing-viewer}

When proofing interactive content in the Desktop Proofing Viewer, you can now configure links that open in a new tab or new window to open within the Desktop Proofing Viewer so you can continue proofing.

In the Legacy proofing viewer,&nbsp;links that opened in a new tab or new window could not be reviewed in the proofing viewer.

For more information, see [Configure proofing viewer settings](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/configure-proofing-viewer-settings.md).

### Presence Indicator in the proofing viewer {#presence-indicator-in-the-proofing-viewer}

Now when reviewing a proof in the Web Proofing Viewer or Desktop Proofing Viewer, you can view the avatar of each user currently viewing the proof is displayed in the upper-right corner of the proofing viewer.

For more information, see [Review a proof simultaneously with multiple reviewers](../../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/review-proof-with-multiple-reviewers.md).

### Filter Comments to Display a Single Page for Interactive URL Proofs in the Desktop Proofing Viewer {#filter-comments-to-display-a-single-page-for-interactive-url-proofs-in-the-desktop-proofing-viewer}

When reviewing a URL in an interactive proof in the Desktop Proofing Viewer, you can now filter comments to display comments made only on the current page.&nbsp;

Prior to this change, this option was available only for static proofs.

For more information, see in the article .

### Desktop Proofing Viewer for Static and Video Content {#desktop-proofing-viewer-for-static-and-video-content}

The Desktop Proofing Viewer now supports static and video content.

Previously, it supported only interactive content.

For information about configuring static and video proofs to open in the Desktop Proofing Viewer, see [Configure proofing viewer settings](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/configure-proofing-viewer-settings.md).

For more information about the Desktop Proofing Viewer, see [Reviewing Proofs in the Desktop Proofing Viewer.](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000686434)

### Add Custom Devices to&nbsp;Your System {#add-custom-devices-to-your-system}

You can now add any custom devices to your system, allowing users to review interactive content and simulate how it appears on a specific device when reviewing a proof in the Desktop Proofing Viewer.

Prior to this change, users could choose only from a list of standard, preconfigured devices.

For information about adding custom devices, see in

For information about how users can select devices when reviewing interactive content, see [Change interactive proof resolution in the proofing viewer](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/view-interactive-content-as-it-appears-in-device.md).
