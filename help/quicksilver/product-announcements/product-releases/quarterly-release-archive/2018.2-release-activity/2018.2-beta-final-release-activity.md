* [Specify Mail Delivery Services for Replying to Workfront Email Notifications](#specify-mail-delivery-services-for-replying-to-workfront-email-notifications) 
* [Receive Email Notifications for Comments on Documents](#receive-email-notifications-for-comments-on-documents)

## Specify Mail Delivery Services for Replying to Workfront Email Notifications {#specify-mail-delivery-services-for-replying-to-workfront-email-notifications}

Workfront administrators now have a choice of mail delivery services when configuring Workfront to allow users to make comments on objects through email replies. Workfront can be configured to use either the default email service or a POP email account.

Prior to this update, Workfront administrators were required to set up a POP account for each user.&nbsp;

For information on configuring a POP email account, see .

For more information on the default mail service, see .

## Receive Email Notifications for Comments on Documents {#receive-email-notifications-for-comments-on-documents}

You now receive an email notification when someone comments on a document you own. This option is enabled by default. You can use the "A comment is added on my document" notification setting to disable the email notification option.

Prior to this change, you received no notifications when someone commented on a document you own.&nbsp;

For more information, see [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When this feature was originally released, users would receive an in-app notification in addition to an email notification. You no longer receive an in-app notification when someone comments on a document you own.&nbsp;

## System-Tracked Updates No Longer Contain an Icon {#system-tracked-updates-no-longer-contain-an-icon}

Any time the Workfront system creates an update in the Updates area on an object (such as within a project), that update no longer contains a corresponding icon.

Prior to this change, any system update also included an icon that represented the update that was made.

For more information about system updates, see [System-tracked updates](../../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/system-tracked-update-feeds/system-tracked-update-feeds.md).

## Option to Convert a Comment to a Task Was Removed {#option-to-convert-a-comment-to-a-task-was-removed}

The option to&nbsp;convert a comment to a task was removed.

Previously, you could convert a comment to a task while in the Updates area on an object.

## Workfront for Salesforce {#workfront-for-salesforce}

We are releasing a new out-of-the-box integration between Salesforce and Workfront. You will be able to do the following:

* Automatically create new Workfront projects when a Salesforce Opportunity reaches a certain Stage, when a new Product is added to an Opportunity, or when the Type of an Account is updated.
* Create Workfront Requests from a Salesforce Opportunity or Account.

This integration will be available to all the customers who have a Workfront Pro edition, or higher, and it will be free.

For more information about Workfront for Salesforce, see&nbsp; [Adobe Workfront for Salesforce](../../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/workfront-for-salesforce.md).

## Workfront for Slack Improvements {#workfront-for-slack-improvements}

You can configure to receive Workfront notifications in your Slack Workfront channel.

The following Workfront notifications can also be configured to be delivered in Slack:

* When someone tags you in a comment or update.
* When you are assigned to a new task or issue.
* When you are requested to approve an item.

Prior to this improvement, you could not receive Workfront notifications in Slack.

For more information about Workfront notifications in Slack, see [Receive Adobe Workfront notifications in Slack](../../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-slack/receive-workfront-notifications-in-slack.md).
