### API Version 10 Now Available in Preview {#api-version-10-now-available-in-preview}

API version 10 is now available in the Preview environment. It will be made available in the Production environment with the 18.3 release. For more information, see [What's New in API Version 10](../../../../wf-api/api/new-api-version-10.md).&nbsp;

### API Version 3 No Longer Supported {#api-version-3-no-longer-supported}

Support for API version 3 is ending in November 2018. For more information about the support schedule for versions of the Workfront API, see [API versioning and support schedule](../../../../wf-api/api/api-version-support-schedule.md).

### TLS Support Is Ending {#tls-support-is-ending}

In order to provide optimal security, Workfront is requiring that all integrations and web traffic using TLS 1.0 or earlier be upgraded to use TLS 1.1 or later. This change is already in effect in the Preview environment.

For more information, see&nbsp; [TLS 1.2 to be required in Adobe Workfront](../../../../product-announcements/announcements/announcement-archive/tls-1-disabled.md).

### JSONP Support is Ending {#jsonp-support-is-ending}

Because JSONP (Javascript with Padding) is an old standard with known security vulnerabilities, Workfront will no longer support JSONP as of November 2018. For more information, see [Ending support for JSONP](../../../../wf-api/api/ending-support-jsonp.md).

### Flash Application Removal {#flash-application-removal}

All functionality that relies on Flash technology is planned for removal from Workfront with the 2018.3 release and replaced with a new solution.

For detailed information about the legacy Flash tools and their replacements, see [Replacement of Flash-based tools in Adobe Workfront](../../../../product-announcements/announcements/announcement-archive/replace-flash-tools.md).

### Various Single Sign-On Options to Be Removed {#various-single-sign-on-options-to-be-removed}

The following Single Sign-On (SSO) options are now supported only in a limited capacity; they will be removed from the product in the second half of 2019:

* LDAP

  For more information about using LDAP with Workfront, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with LDAP](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/removal-various-sso-options.md).

* Active Directory

  For more information about using Active Directory with Workfront, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with Active Directory](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/removal-various-sso-options.md).

* SAML 1.1

  For more information about using SAML 1.1 with Workfront, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 1.1](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/removal-various-sso-options.md).

Following is the removal timeline for these SSO options:

* **Limited support:** August 2018 - January 2019

  Major issues will be fixed; low severity issues will not be addressed.

* **Deprecation:** January 2019 - August 2019

  Not supported.

* **No longer available in Workfront:** August 2019

These changes are being made in preparation for the enhanced authentication experience, which is currently available only for a limited number of customers.

### Legacy Workfront FusionUpdate - September 20, 2018 {#legacy-workfront-fusionupdate-september-20-2018}

Legacy Workfront Fusion is an&nbsp;integration platform that enables you to connect Workfront to multiple third-party applications.

With the latest update, Legacy Workfront Fusion now provides an improved design that makes the process for creating new FLOs more intuitive. The specific changes include:

* **New FLO:**&nbsp;Clicking the new FLO now takes users to the Designers screen, rather than first prompting to pick the connector. This change helps you to orient yourself to the overall FLO and understand that any FLO should start with an Event.
* **Add Function:**&nbsp;The function picker has been updated to make it easier to find and select the desired function. Descriptions of the functions, along with input and output fields, have been updated to add intuitive guidance. The new "Most Popular" section helps you get started with the most commonly used Functions.
