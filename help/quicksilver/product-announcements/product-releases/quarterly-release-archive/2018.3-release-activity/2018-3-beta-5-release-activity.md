## Track Approvals You've Submitted in the Home Area {#track-approvals-you-ve-submitted-in-the-home-area}

You can now use the Home area to interact with approvals you have submitted to other users.

From Home, you can:

* Recall approvals
* Remind users of approvals
* Add users to document approvals
* View proof approvals

  Previously, you could interact with submitted approvals only in the My Work area.&nbsp;

For more information, see [Manage approvals](../../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/manage-approvals.md).&nbsp;

## Replacement of Flash-Based Tools in Workfront {#replacement-of-flash-based-tools-in-workfront}

All functionality that relies on Flash technology is planned for removal from Workfront with the 2018.3 release and will be replaced with a new solution.

For more information about all areas affected by the removal of these features and to understand what tools will replace them, see [Replacement of Flash-based tools in Adobe Workfront](../../../../product-announcements/announcements/announcement-archive/replace-flash-tools.md).

## Allowing Work License Users to Access the Scheduling Subtab of a Project {#allowing-work-license-users-to-access-the-scheduling-subtab-of-a-project}

Users with a Work license can now access the Scheduling subtab of a project, under the Staffing tab.

Prior to this enhancement, only users with a Plan license could access this subtab.

For information about the access needed for accessing the Scheduling subtab of a project, see "Get started with Resource Scheduling".

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Resource Scheduling tools have been deprecated and removed from Workfront with the 23.1 release. For information about scheduling resources using the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md).

## Improved Filters in the Resource Planner {#improved-filters-in-the-resource-planner}

You can now filter information in the Resource Planner to include project-specific and user-specific fields, including custom fields.

Prior to this improvement, you could filter only for a limited number of built-in fields and criteria in the Resource Planner.

For information about filtering information in the Resource Planner, see [Filter information in the Resource Planner](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/filter-resource-planner.md).

## View Actual Hours in the Resource Planner {#view-actual-hours-in-the-resource-planner}

You can view Actual Hours in the User View of the Resource Planner.

Prior to this improvement, Actual Hours were not visible in the Resource Planner.

For information about viewing hour information in the Resource Planner, see [Resource Planner overview](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).

## Resource Planner Data in the Business Case Export {#resource-planner-data-in-the-business-case-export}

When you export the Business Case to a PDF, the financial information in the exported file now reflects the information in the Resource Budgeting area and the Resource Planner.&nbsp;

Previously, the exported file reflected the information in the Legacy Resource Estimates area and the Capacity Planner.&nbsp;

For information about exporting the Business Case, see the [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md) section in [Create a Business Case for a project](../../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

## Enable Company-Level Billing Rate Override {#enable-company-level-billing-rate-override}

You can now enable an option to allow company-level billing rates to override project-level billing rates. After you update billing rates at the company level, you can manually recalculate finances on the project to reflect those changes.

If you enable this setting, the company-level billing rates override historical job role rates on the project.

Previously, you could not apply company-level billing rates changes to a project unless you removed the company from the project, then re-attached it.

For more information, see [Override Project-Level Billing Rates with Company-Level Billing Rates](../../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/override-project-level-with-company-level-billing-rates.md).&nbsp;

## Simplified Role-Based Approvals {#simplified-role-based-approvals}

Role-based approvals now work more simply on a project. Now, users must be assigned to the project team and have the role assigned in their user profile to see approvals assigned to their primary or secondary roles.

Previously, you had to assign users to the project team, ensure they had the correct role in their user profile, and select that role in the Legacy Team Builder.

For more information, see the section [Project Team overview](../../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-team-overview.md) in the article [Project Team overview](../../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-team-overview.md).

## Utilization Report: Populates Budgeted Hours from New Resource Budgeting Area {#utilization-report-populates-budgeted-hours-from-new-resource-budgeting-area}

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;This functionality was first introduced to the Preview environment with the 2018.2 release. It will release to the Production environment with the 2018.3 release.&nbsp;

Budgeted Hours in the Utilization Report are now populated from information available in the new Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case.

Prior to this change, information from the legacy Resource Estimates area&nbsp;was used.

For more information, see&nbsp; [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md)&nbsp;in the article&nbsp; [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md).

## Utilization Report: View Budgeted Hours by User on a Project {#utilization-report-view-budgeted-hours-by-user-on-a-project}

>[!NOTE]
>
>This functionality was first introduced to the Preview environment with the 2018.2 release. It will release to the Production environment with the 2018.3 release.&nbsp;

The Utilization report on a project now displays Budgeted Hours by User.

Prior to this change, the Utilization report displayed Budgeted Hours only by job role.&nbsp;

For more information, see&nbsp; [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md)&nbsp;in the article&nbsp; [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md).

## SWF Files No Longer Supported in the proofing viewer {#swf-files-no-longer-supported-in-the-proofing-viewer}

Because of security concerns associated with Adobe Flash, the proofing viewer no longer supports proofs created from SWF files. If you open a proof previously created for a SWF file, a message displays where the proof content previously displayed in the proofing viewer. You can see any comments on the proof. You can also download comments and download the original SWF file.

For more information, see [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md) in the article [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md).&nbsp;

## Actions More Quickly Accessible in the Comment List in the proofing viewer {#actions-more-quickly-accessible-in-the-comment-list-in-the-proofing-viewer}

You can now more quickly add or change the action for a comment in the proofing viewer. Simply click the More icon on any comment, then click the action you want in the drop-down menu.

Previously, you had to open the comment, open a drop-down menu, open a submenu, then click the action you want.

For more information, see [Use actions on proof comments](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/use-actions-on-comments-in-viewer.md).

## Proof Sharing Improvement in the proofing viewer {#proof-sharing-improvement-in-the-proofing-viewer}

When you send a URL from the proofing viewer, the options that appear are now organized exactly like the options you see when you share a URL from the Documents area.

Previously, these options provided the same functionality that they do now, but their organization was inconsistent with the corresponding options in the Documents list.

For more information, see section&nbsp; [Share the URL](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/share-a-proof-in-proofing-viewer.md#sharing-the-url) in the article&nbsp; [Share a proof from the proofing viewer](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/share-a-proof-in-proofing-viewer.md).

## Comments List Enhancements in the proofing viewer {#comments-list-enhancements-in-the-proofing-viewer}

The following improvements are now available in the Comments list:

* A light grey background now appears behind comment text to make it stand out from other text that appears in the Comments panel, such as names of reviewers, review times, and proof page numbers. This makes it easier to read only proofing feedback when that's the only thing you want to read.

  Previously, the entire background of the Comments panel was white.

  For more information, see .

* Replies to a comment are now indented under the comment. This makes it easier to distinguish replies from the original comment above them.

  Previously, replies under a comment were left-aligned with the comment.

  For more information, see in .

* When you resolve a comment in the proofing viewer, the green Resolved checkmark icon appears without any text in the upper right corner of the comment. This gives the Comment panel a cleaner appearance that is easier to scan for the information you need.

  Previously, the Resolved checkmark icon appeared next to the word RESOLVED in the upper-left corner of the comment&nbsp;

  For more information, see in .

## Zoom and Pan Video Proofs in the proofing viewer {#zoom-and-pan-video-proofs-in-the-proofing-viewer}

Now you can zoom in on video proofs and pan to areas of the proof you need to examine more closely.

## Lighter Background in the proofing viewer {#lighter-background-in-the-proofing-viewer}

The background in the proofing viewer is now slightly lighter. This change makes it easier to distinguish proofing content containing black backgrounds and edges.

Previously, the proofing viewer background was black.

## Better Visibility When a Comment Has Been Edited in the proofing viewer {#better-visibility-when-a-comment-has-been-edited-in-the-proofing-viewer}

The label "Edited" now appears on any comment that a reviewer has changed. When you mouse over this, the name of the reviewer and the date of the change appears.

## View the Number of Comments Associated with an Action in the Comment List in the proofing viewer {#view-the-number-of-comments-associated-with-an-action-in-the-comment-list-in-the-proofing-viewer}

When you click the Filter icon in the Comment list, you can now see how many comments are associated with each action.

Actions are available in the Comment list only if they are enabled for your organization.

## Specify the Stage When Adding Users to a Proof in the proofing viewer {#specify-the-stage-when-adding-users-to-a-proof-in-the-proofing-viewer}

When you add a reviewer to a proof that has an automated workflow in the proofing viewer, you can specify the stage in which you want the reviewer to work on the proof. This is like the functionality available when you add users to a proof outside the proofing viewer.

Previously, when you added reviewers to a proof from the proofing viewer, Workfront placed them in the stage that was currently active.

For more information, see [Share a proof by adding users to it](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/share-a-proof-in-proofing-viewer.md#sharing-with-individual-users) in [Share a proof from the proofing viewer](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/share-a-proof-in-proofing-viewer.md).

## Opening the Associated Website from an Interactive or Static Website Proof {#opening-the-associated-website-from-an-interactive-or-static-website-proof}

While you are reviewing a proof containing interactive or static web content, you can now click a button to easily open the associated website in a new browser tab from the proofing viewer. This allows you to compare what you see in the proof to the actual website using two different tabs.

Previously you could open the associated website by hovering over the URL and clicking the tooltip. This approach was accessible and intuitive.

## Print Summary Enhancements {#print-summary-enhancements}

The following improvements are now available on the Print Summary page:

* You can now specify whether you want to include all the pages in the proof, or only the pages containing comments.

  Previously, you could include only the pages containing comments.

* If your proof has stages, you can now include a diagram that shows the order of the proof's stages and the decisions made for each stage.

  Previously, this diagram was not available.

* Now, when multiple markups are associated with one comment, the number for that comment appears on each markup on the Print Summary page.

  Previously, the comment number appeared only on the first markup associated with the comment. The other markups for the comment displayed without a number.

* If the proof is a web capture, any page containing comments displays the resolution at which the web page was captured. This is helpful, for example, if the proof contains pages captured for mobile devices and the same pages captured for laptop and desktop computers.
* Now, when you filter comments in the Print Summary page by Action, Author, or Unresolved status, your filter applies to proofs you export as PDF or Excel files, not just printed proofs.

For more information, see [Print a proof summary within Adobe Workfront](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/print-proof-summary-in-wf.md).

## Improved Proof Loading Time {#improved-proof-loading-time}

We have made some performance improvements that should result in improved load times when opening proofs.

For information about opening proofs, see .

## New Look and Feel of the Updates Tab in the Workfront Mobile App {#new-look-and-feel-of-the-updates-tab-in-the-workfront-mobile-app}

The look and feel of the Updates tab on the Mobile App is now updated. This improvement is currently available only in the Workfront beta app for Android.

For information about managing updates and comments in the Workfront mobile app, see the section&nbsp;&nbsp;in .
