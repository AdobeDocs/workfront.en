# R1 release activity overview

This page provides information about the functionality included in the R1 release.&nbsp;

The R1 release is currently available to test in Preview; R1 releases to the Production environment in a phased rollout on the evenings of April 26 and 27, 2017 (MDT).

The R1 release enables users, knowledge workers, and administrators to better manage their work. With R1, adminstrators&nbsp;can customize Workfront to better match the&nbsp;organization's terminology; knowledge workers can leverage utilization reports to better understand how projects are tracking against planned and budgeted hours; users can engage in Workfront directly from Outlook 365 and be more productive when using the Workfront mobile app; and much more.
