# Functionality made available in Preview in 2016

The following features were made available in the Preview environment in 2016. These features are planned to release to the production environment with the R1 release.

## Resource Scheduling Improvements

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Resource Scheduling tools have been deprecated and removed from Workfront with the 23.1 release. For information about scheduling resources using the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md). 

Now you can see all tasks on projects for which you are the Resource Manager, enabling you to be more informed when making scheduling decisions.

For general information about the tools available for scheduling resources, see "Get started with Resource Scheduling".

To adjust the information that is displayed on the scheduling timeline, create a filter, as described in "Filter information in the Scheduling area".

In addition to viewing tasks on the projects you are responsible for, you can use the scheduling timeline to make changes to resourcing assignments. For information about how to manage user assignments on the scheduling timeline, see "Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas".

## Manage User Allocations on the Scheduling Timeline

Now when scheduling resources with the new resource scheduling tools, you can determine how the&nbsp;planned hours for a task or issue are allocated to users. You can divide hours across days in the task duration and among assigned users.

For more information, see "Manage user allocations in the Scheduling areas".

## User Allocations Are Disabled by Default

User allocation shading&nbsp;on the scheduling timeline when scheduling resources is&nbsp;now disabled by default.

Previously, allocation shading was displayed by default and could not be disabled.

For more information about how to enable user allocation options, see 
"Manage user allocations in the Scheduling areas".

## Layout Template Determines Whether the New or&nbsp;Legacy Calendar Displays in the My Work Area

**Preview Sandbox: Dec 7, 2016; Early Access: Dec 14, 2016**&nbsp;

The new calendar is displayed in the My Work area by default when no layout template is applied.

If you choose, you can configure the legacy calendar to be&nbsp;displayed in the My Work area by applying a layout template to the My Work area that is&nbsp;configured to show only the Commit Date on tasks and issues.

When using the legacy calendar in the My Work area, only work you have committed to is displayed.

To configure Workfront to display the new&nbsp;calendar in the My Work area when a layout template is applied, configure the layout template to show the Planned Completion&nbsp;Date on&nbsp;tasks and issues, then assign that layout template to the appropriate users.

For more information about configuring the layout template, see [Create and manage layout templates](../../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md#customizing-my-work) in [Create and manage layout templates](../../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

## Outlook 365 Beta

**Beta: TBD; Public Availability: TBD**

You can use Workfront from Outlook for Office 365, as described in the following sections:

* [Set up Adobe Workfront for Outlook](../../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-outlook/set-up-workfront-for-outlook.md) 
* "Updating an Existing Item from an Email with Outlook 365"

## Reorder Columns in Any List with Drag-and-Drop

**Early Access: Feb 20, 2016**

You can change the order of columns in any list by dragging a column from one location and dropping it in another.

This is especially useful when viewing&nbsp;the Gantt chart and the list view simultaneously and the column that you want to view is not displayed on the left side of the page.&nbsp;

For more information, see [Modify column width and order](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/modify-column-width-order.md)

## Updated Look and Feel in the Dashboard List

Now when viewing a dashboard list, the look and feel is more modern and scalable.

For more information about dashboards, see [Create a dashboard](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/create-dashboard.md)

## Control Access to Custom Forms

**Preview Sandbox: Jan 23, 2016**

You can now control who has access to a custom form by granting access to individual users, teams, roles, groups, or companies.&nbsp;

Prior to this change,&nbsp;you could grant access only to groups.

## Integration with Adobe Creative Cloud

**Add-On available for download: April 2016**

The Workfront Extension for&nbsp;Adobe Creative Cloud is designed to allow you to save and&nbsp;export assets you create&nbsp;in the Creative Cloud to Workfront, thereby&nbsp;speeding up the approval and review process.
