## Resource Scheduling Improvements {#resource-scheduling-improvements}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Resource Scheduling tools have been deprecated and removed from Workfront with the 23.1 release. For information about scheduling resources using the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md).

The following resource scheduling improvements are available when scheduling resources for a team, for a project, or for multiple projects as the resource manager:

* [View Scheduling Area in Full-Screen Mode](#view-scheduling-area-in-full-screen-mode) 
* [More Date Range Options for Viewing the Resource Scheduling Area](#more-date-range-options-for-viewing-the-resource-scheduling-area) 
* [View Projected Dates on the Scheduling Timeline](#view-projected-dates-on-the-scheduling-timeline)

### View&nbsp;Scheduling Area in Full-Screen Mode {#view-scheduling-area-in-full-screen-mode}

You can view the scheduling timeline in full-screen mode, allowing you to see more information&nbsp;in&nbsp;a single&nbsp;view.&nbsp;

For more information, see "Get started with Resource Scheduling".

### More Date Range Options for Viewing the Resource Scheduling Area {#more-date-range-options-for-viewing-the-resource-scheduling-area}

You can view the following additional date range options when viewing the scheduling timeline:

* Single-day view
* 4-week view
* 6-week view

Prior to this change, you could view the scheduling timeline only in a 1-week, 2-week, or 3-week view. These date ranges&nbsp;are still available in addition to the new date ranges.

When you view the scheduling timeline in a single-day view, user allocations (including daily total hours) cannot be displayed.

For more information, see "Get started with Resource Scheduling".

### View Projected Dates on the Scheduling Timeline {#view-projected-dates-on-the-scheduling-timeline}

Now you can configure the scheduling timeline&nbsp;to show the&nbsp;Projected Dates rather than the Planned Dates for&nbsp;tasks and issues.&nbsp;

Prior to this change, tasks and issues on the scheduling timeline&nbsp;showed only Planned Dates.

When you view Projected Dates on the scheduling timeline, user allocations (including daily total hours) cannot be displayed.

For more information, see "Get started with Resource Scheduling".

## Widescreen Display {#widescreen-display}

When you display any of the following objects in Workfront, the entire browser window is filled automatically:

* Projects
* Tasks
* Issues
* Reports
* Dashboards
* Calendars

Prior to this change, there were two white sidebars on either side of the displayed area. Now, the widescreen view adjusts dynamically to the width of your screen and of your browser window.

## Resize and Reorder Columns in Reports and Lists {#resize-and-reorder-columns-in-reports-and-lists}

You can now reorder and resize columns in a report or list, without having to edit the report. (This functionality was removed with the deprecation of&nbsp;the Early Access environment earlier this year. It is now being reintroduced.)

This functionality is not available for dashboard lists or reports, as those lists have been redesigned in a new data grid structure. All other lists will have this functionality enabled with this release.

For more information about resizing and reordering columns, see [Modify column width and order](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/modify-column-width-order.md).

## Clear Custom Data Option When Copying Tasks and Issues {#clear-custom-data-option-when-copying-tasks-and-issues}

When copying a task or issue, you can now select an option to clear any custom data.&nbsp;When you choose to clear the custom data of a task or issue, the form is copied to the new item, but the custom data on form is not. Clearing custom data&nbsp;also affects the custom forms attached to the documents attached to the items, or the custom forms attached to the expenses on the task.

Prior to this change, the custom data included on a custom form was also copied to the new item when you copied the task or issue.&nbsp;

For more information about copying tasks, see [Copy and duplicate tasks](../../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/copy-and-duplicate-tasks.md).

For more information about copying issues, see [Copy issues](../../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/copy-issues.md).

## Create a Project Directly from a Template {#create-a-project-directly-from-a-template}

You can now create a project from a template, at the template level.

Prior to this change, you could create a project from a template only on the Projects tab in the Projects area of Workfront, by using the **New Project From Template** option.

For more information about creating a project from a template, see [Create a project using a template](../../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project-from-template.md).

## Prevent Tasks and Issues from Being Deleted When&nbsp;Hours Are Logged {#prevent-tasks-and-issues-from-being-deleted-when-hours-are-logged}

You can now configure Workfront&nbsp;to either allow or prevent the deletion of tasks and issues that have hours logged.

Prior to this change, when you deleted a task or issue where hours were logged, the hours were either deleted with the task or issue, or they were moved to the project, depending on your Timesheet & Hours Preferences.

For more information about deleting tasks, see [Delete tasks](../../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/delete-tasks.md).

For more information about deleting issues, see [Delete issues](../../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/delete-issues.md).

For more information about enabling the system setting for task and issue deletion, see [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).

## Removal of the "Early Access" Setting from the Setup Area {#removal-of-the-early-access-setting-from-the-setup-area}

We are removing the setting that allowed Workfront administrators to enroll users to participate in the Early Access environment. This functionality has been deprecated since the end of 2016. We have not released any new functionality to Early Access in 2017, and all the features that were remaining in that environment have been moved to Production.

Prior to this change, Workfront administrators could still add users to the Early Access environment, although there were no new features to access.

## Workfront Default Email Address Change {#workfront-default-email-address-change}

The default email address for Workfront outgoing mail has changed from [noreply@attask.com](mailto:noreply@attask.com) to [noreply@my.workfront.com](mailto:noreply@workfront.com).

If you currently filter emails sent from Workfront, you need to change your filter to reflect the new default address.&nbsp;

The change in the default address has no effect on configured Workfront email addresses.&nbsp;

For more information, see .

## In-App Notification for Subscribed Objects {#in-app-notification-for-subscribed-objects}

When a user makes&nbsp;a comment on projects, tasks, and issues to which you are subscribed, you now receive an in-app notification. To learn more about subscription in-app notifications, see [View and manage in-app notifications](../../../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/view-and-manage-in-app-notifications.md).

Depending on the features your Workfront administrator has enabled, you can also receive email notifications for subscribed items. You can easily unsubscribe from an item through a link on a subscription email, as described in [Adobe Workfront notifications](../../../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/wf-notifications.md).

Prior this change, you always received an email notification for subscribed items, and there was no option to receive an in-app notification.

While you can disable subscription email, you cannot disable in-app notifications for subscribed items. For more information see [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md).

To learn more about subscribing to items, see [Subscribe to items in Adobe Workfront](../../../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/subscribe-to-items-in-workfront.md).

## @Tagging Currently Not Available in the Preview Environment {#tagging-currently-not-available-in-the-preview-environment}

As we work to bring Rich Text Format functionality to the update stream, you will temporarily be unable to use the @ symbol to tag other users in the update stream for the following objects in the Preview Environment:

* Project
* Task
* Issue
* Timesheet

You can still tag others by clicking the **Include Others on this Update** icon.

For more information, see [Tag others on updates](../../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md).

## Include User Allocation Information in the Utilization Report on a Project {#include-user-allocation-information-in-the-utilization-report-on-a-project}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Resource Scheduling tools have been deprecated and removed from Workfront with the 23.1 release. For information about scheduling resources using the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md). 

The Utilization Report on a project now takes into consideration whether the Planned Hours have been re-allocated across the duration of a task. When the user allocation for hours have been modified (as described in "Manage user allocations in the Scheduling areas", the data in the Utilization Report can be affected if the dates selected in the Utilization Report contain only a portion of a task.

For more information, see [Overview of the Resource Utilization report](../../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/using-built-in-reports/resource-utilization-report.md).
