## Improvements to the Settings panel and ability to color-code projects and their tasks in the Workload Balancer

To improve your experience when using the Workload Balancer, we have introduced the following enhancements:

* Redesigned the Settings panel to include options that previously were located on the toolbar. This improves the use of the space in the toolbar.
* Added the ability to customize the color theme by Project. When selecting to color-code by Project, each project and its work items display in the same color. The colors are unique to each project. Before this enhancement, you could only color-code by Project Status.

For more information, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md).

## Assign work in bulk using the Workload Balancer

In continuing our effort to deprecate the Scheduling tools and replace them with the Workload Balancer, we have added the ability to manage assignments in bulk. You can now assign multiple work items at a time to multiple users, replace users from multiple work items with other users, and unassign users from multiple items at one time. You can perform all these with one action by using the new Bulk Assignment functionality in the Workload Balancer.

Prior to this enhancement, you could only assign one user to one work item either manually or by dragging and dropping.

The new Bulk Assignments also include new filtering capabilities by Project and Task Status, in addition to Name.

For more information, see [Overview of assigning work in the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/assign-work-in-workload-balancer.md).

For information about the deprecation of the Scheduling tools, see [Deprecation of Resource Scheduling tools in Adobe Workfront](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/deprecate-resource-scheduling.md).

## Override currency when managing job roles

To help you easily manage cost and billing rates across global organizations, we have implemented overriding the currency of a job role. Using this feature, you can now set cost and billing rates for job roles in the currency that matches the job roleâ€™s location. This will override the system currency in all financial calculations for the job role.

For information, see [Create and manage job roles](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/create-manage-job-roles.md).
