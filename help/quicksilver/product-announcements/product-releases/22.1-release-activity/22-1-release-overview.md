<h2>Functionality being removed from Production</h2>
<h3>Feature rollback: Carry over the existing proof workflow when generating a new version</h3>

<p>In the new Workfront experience after this change is removed, proofs created with the Simple proof selection will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.</p>
<p>In Workfront Classic after this change is removed, the option to Generate Proof will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.</p>
