## Improved proofing capabilities for reviewers and requestors

>[!NOTE]
>
>Released to EMEA customers with integrated proofing created before July 6th, 2021 only. This functionality coming to Preview in a phased rollout beginning January 13 and ending January 17 for the following customers: >
>* EMEA customers with both integrated and standalone proofing
>* EMEA customers with integrated proofing created after July 6th, 2021
>* All U.S. customers
>

To provide a more integrated experience between Workfront and Proof, we've made several improvements regarding proofing capabilities for Reviewers and Requestors:

You can grant Moderator or Author roles to any user in Workfront, regardless of whether they have a Proofing license, giving them additional rights, like applying actions or resolving comments.

You can add Reviewers and Requestors to proofs that require a login or that need to be electronically signed.

All users also benefit from improved connectivity between Workfront and Proof. Now, when deactivating a user or updating a user's email address, your updates are correctly reflected in proofing when changed in Workfront.

## Electronic Signature Enhancements for proofs

We've made it easier for users to sign proofs electronically. Now, users can use their Workfront credentials to sign a decision on a proof.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To electronically sign a proof with SSO credentials, you must set SSO up in Workfront Proof. For more information on enabling SSO, see [Configure Single Sign-On for Workfront Proof users](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-sso-for-wp-users.md).

Previously, users had to use Workfront Proof credentials, which are different from their Workfront credentials.

For more info, see [Proof security overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/proof-security-overview.md).

## Desktop Viewer Upgrade

We've upgraded the Desktop Proofing Viewer to support up to Chrome version 91 for greater compatibility with interactive proofs.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Windows users must manually reinstall the desktop viewer to upgrade to the latest version. After that, future updates to the Desktop Proofing Viewer will be automatic. For help reinstalling, see [Install the Desktop Proofing Viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/use-the-desktop-proofing-viewer/installing-desktop-proofing-viewer.md).

Mac users will be upgraded to the latest version automatically.
