# Second Quarter 2024 Update stream and notification enhancements

This page describes all Update stream and notification enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q2-release-activity/24-q2-release-overview.md).

## Access to the legacy commenting area has been removed 

>[!NOTE]

>Preview release: April 1, 2024; Production for all customers: With the 24.4 release (April 2024)

We have removed the "New commenting" toggle in the Updates area for projects, tasks, issues, and documents. The new commenting is now the default and only option for these objects. With this change, you are no longer able to revert back to the legacy commenting experience. 

For more information, see [New commenting experience](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md).

## New commenting stream now available in quick actions for new Home widgets

We have now added the new commenting functionality to the **Add new update** quick action button in the My Work, My Projects, My Tasks, and My Issues widgets in new Home.

For more information, see [Get started with the new Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## Additional commenter information available in the new commenting experience

We have made the following enhancements in the new commenting experience:

* You can click a commenter's name to see their name, role, and email address in an information box. This information can help you identify the correct user, if you have more than one user with the same name. When you click the commenter's name in the information box, their user profile opens.
* Your user name is highlighted in comments that you are tagged on, when you are mentioned in the comment text.

For more information, see [Update work](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).

Comments made on the system activity records in the legacy commenting experience are now populated on the System Activity tab in the new commenting experience as read-only. You cannot reply to system activity records in the new commenting experience.

## New update stream tab to capture both comments and system activity entries

To give you a chronologically cohesive view of both comments and system activity logs, we are introducing a third tab to the Updates area of all objects. The "All" tab captures both user comments and system activity comments in one cohesive stream.

The All tab is a view-only tab. You cannot reply to comments or tag other users in existing comments in the All tab. To reply to a specific comment, use the link from the All tab to the Comments tab.

For more information, see [Updates section overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md).
