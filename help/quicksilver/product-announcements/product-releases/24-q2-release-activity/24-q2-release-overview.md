# Second Quarter 2024 release overview

This page provides information about functionality that is included in the Second Quarter 2024 release. These enhancements are planned to become available in the Production environment throughout the quarter.

<!--The 24.1 release webinar was on January 11, 2024. You can [register for the webinar to view an on-demand recording here](https://webinars.on24.com/adobe_workfront/whatsnewin241?partnerref=releaseoverview). -->

<span class="preview">Off-cycle features (those releasing to Production prior to the Second Quarter 2024 release date) are highlighted in yellow.</span>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The 23.3 release included the option to move your organization to monthly releases. Therefore, Workfront has changed the numbering scheme of releases to account for both monthly and quarterly release tracks. The first number designates the year, and the second number signifies the month of the release. Example: The release for April, 2024 reads as 24.4.
>
>Monthly and quarterly releases are planned to be available on the Thursday of the second full week of the month, unless otherwise specified.
>
>|Monthly release|Quarterly release|
>|----|----|
>|<ul><li>24.2 (February 15, 2024)</li><li>24.3 (March 14, 2024)</li><li>24.4 (April 11, 2024)</li></ul>| <ul><li>24.4 (April 2024)</li></ul>|
