## Enhancements to automated folder creation workflow in the Adobe Experience Manager integration

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: March 11, 2024; Production for all customers: March 14, 2024

To ensure that your Adobe Experience Manager folders more accurately reflect your needs, we've made some updates to the Adobe Experience Manager linked folders workflow.

Now you can:

* Create nested folder trees, then indicate which folders in the tree should be available in Workfront.
* Create multiple folder trees, then set one as the default for the integration.
* Set up filters based on custom form field data such that a specified folder tree will be create in Adobe Experience Manager.

For information on configuring linked folders in the Adobe Experience Manager workflows, see [Create Adobe Experience Manager linked folders](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md#create-adobe-experience-manager-linked-folders).

For information on using the Adobe Experience Manager workflows on projects or project templates, see[Use workflows in the Experience Manager Assets integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/use-aem-workflows.md).
