# Second Quarter 2024 Other enhancements

This page describes all other enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q2-release-activity/24-q2-release-overview.md).

## New update stream tab to capture both comments and system activity entries

>Preview release: February 22, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.3 release (March 2024); Production for all customers: With the 24.4 release (April 2024)

To give you a chronologically cohesive view of both comments and system activity logs, we are introducing a third tab to the Updates area of all objects. The "All" tab captures both user comments and system activity comments in one cohesive stream.

The All tab is a view-only tab. You cannot reply to comments or tag other users in existing comments in the All tab. To reply to a specific comment, use the link from the All tab to the Comments tab.

For more information, see [Updates section overview](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/updates-tab-overview.md).
