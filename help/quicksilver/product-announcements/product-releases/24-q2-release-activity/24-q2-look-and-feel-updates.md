# Look-and-feel updates during the Second Quarter 2024 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the Second Quarter 2024 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the Second Quarter 2024 release, see [Second Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q2-release-activity/24-q2-release-overview.md).

## New look-and-feel updates for tabs in the Custom Forms area

>Preview release: February 8, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.3 release (March, 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 24.4 release (April, 2024)

We have updated the tabs for Forms, Fields, and Sections in the Setup > Custom Forms area to a more modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. You now access the three areas from the left navigation menu. Filters, views, and groupings are still available for the lists. The updated design applies to custom forms, fields, and sections created in both the new form designer and the legacy form builder.

For information, see [Design a form with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md) and [Create or edit a custom form with the legacy form builder](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).

## Indicator for manually adjusted allocations in the Workload Balancer

To provide more clarity about manual adjustments or contouring in the Workload Balancer, manually adjusted hourly allocations now show a pencil icon.
