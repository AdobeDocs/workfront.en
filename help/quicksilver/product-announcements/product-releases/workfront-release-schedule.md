# Adobe Workfront release schedule and process

## Update schedule for Preview

The Preview environment is updated once a week with new features. These features are communicated in the release notes for the upcoming quarterly release.

Releases typically take place around 8-10 PM US Mountain Time.

## Update schedule for Production

### Product features


Adobe Workfront has two models for releasing new features and updates. Your organization can choose whether to receive new functionality on a quarterly basis, or on a faster release schedule. 

Monthly and quarterly releases are planned to be available on the Thursday of the second full week of the month, unless otherwise specified. For upcoming dates, see the most recent [Release Overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md). 

Releases typically take place around 8-10 PM US Mountain Time the evening before the release date.

Usually, features in Preview are made available in your Production environment with the next release. However, in some cases, features are made available in the Production environment outside of a scheduled release. These changes typically remain in Preview for a minimum of 2 weeks to provide you with adequate time to become acquainted with the changes. 

For more information about quarterly and fast release processes, see [Enable or disable fast releases for your organization](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/enable-fast-release-process.md).

### Maintenance updates

Issue fixes to the Adobe Workfront product are made available in the Production environment each week. See the [Workfront maintenance updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page to see what's been fixed recently.

## Features removed from a scheduled release

All features associated with a given release (Monthly or quarterly) are available to test in Preview for a minimum of 2-4 weeks prior to the final release to Production. If features are removed from the scheduled release before this time, the following actions are taken to inform customers:

* The release notes for the scheduled release (found from the [Product releases](../../product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md) page) are updated to indicate that the feature was removed.

If features are removed from the scheduled release after all features are available to test in Preview, the following actions are taken to inform customers:

* The release notes for the release (found from the [Product releases](../../product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md) page) are updated to indicate that the feature was removed. 
* A post is added to the Workfront Community stating that the feature was removed.
* A message is sent to all customers via the Announcement Center stating that the feature was removed. (The Announcement Center is Workfront's in-app notification center. For more information, see [Send announcements](../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/view-send-announcements.md).)

## Beta releases

At times, Workfront releases new features as part of a beta program. 
The specific information about each beta, including how to participate, releases when each beta program launches and all beta programs are different. 

The following beta programs are available from Workfront:

* **Closed or private beta**: The following are characteristics of a closed or private beta release:

    * Features are available to a small group of customers, carefully selected by Workfront.
    * Participants typically work with a Product Manager and provide feedback on a regular basis. 
    * New features that are part of the beta can be released to either Preview or Production, or to a separate environment made available for the purpose of the beta program. Closed beta features are released at random intervals and with no warning. 
    * There is no release information for closed betas on the Product release pages. 

* **Open or public beta**: The following are characteristics of an open or public beta release:

    * The features are available to all Workfront customers, but are in a beta state. They might not always be fully functional and feedback is always welcome.
    * The participation in a public beta is optional and customers can decide whether to turn on the beta features themselves. 
    * New features that are part of the beta can be released to either Preview or Production. 
    * Features might release more often than the regular release patterns for Workfront. 
    * Information about when features are released to a public beta is included in the Product release pages. 

For information about product release notes, see [Product releases](../../product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md). 

## Other releases

At times, Workfront might release features that might not be documented in the release notes, maintenance updates, or in any of the documentation articles. This happens in an effort to test new features before making them permanent. Usually, these tests are released to a limited number of customers, but there might be a time when they might be released to everyone. They can be released to either the Preview or the Production environments. 

If you come across something in the system that doesn't match documentation and about which you might have questions, we ask that you contact our Customer Support team. For more information, see [Contact Customer Support](../../workfront-basics/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/contact-customer-support.md).
