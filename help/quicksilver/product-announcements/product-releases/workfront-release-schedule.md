# Adobe Workfront release schedule and process

## Update schedule for Preview

The Preview environment is updated once a week with new features. These features are communicated in the release notes for the upcoming quarterly release.

## Update schedule for Production

### Product features

Usually, features in Preview are made available in the Production environment with the next quarterly release. However, in some cases, features are made available in the Production environment outside of a quarterly release. These changes remain in Preview for a minimum of 2 weeks to provide you with adequate time to become acquainted with the changes. These changes are also communicated via the Announcement Center at the time they are added to Preview.

### Maintenance updates

Issue fixes to the Adobe Workfront product are made available in the Production environment each week. See the [Workfront maintenance updates](https://one.workfront.com/s/article/Workfront-Maintenance-Updates-1882317350) page to see what's been fixed recently.

## Features removed from a quarterly release

All features associated with a given quarterly release are available to test in Preview 2-4 weeks prior to the final release to Production. If features are removed from the quarterly release before this time, the following actions are taken to inform customers:

* The release notes for the quarterly release (found from the [Product releases](../../product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md) page) are updated to indicate that the feature was removed.

If features are removed from the quarterly release after all features are available to test in Preview, the following actions are taken to inform customers:

* The release notes for the quarterly release (found from the [Product releases](../../product-announcements/product-releases/product-releases.md) page) are updated to indicate that the feature was removed. 
* A post is added to the Workfront Community stating that the feature was removed.
* A message is sent to all customers via the Announcement Center stating that the feature was removed. (The Announcement Center is Workfront's in-app notification center. For more information, see [Send announcements](../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/view-send-announcements.md).)
