To stay up-to-date with recent changes to the Workfront API, we've created a new Salesforce integration. The new integration features the same functionality as the previous version, and was updated to avoid losing functionality deprecated in the API.

For instructions and links for downloading and installing the new integration, see [Install Adobe Workfront for Salesforce](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/install-workfront-for-salesforce.md).
