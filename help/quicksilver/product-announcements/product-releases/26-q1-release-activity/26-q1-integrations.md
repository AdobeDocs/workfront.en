For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2026 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2026 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/26-q1-release-activity/26-q1-release-overview.md).

You can choose a Workfront project to send a proof to. This helps keep all related assets and proofs organized within the same project.

Previously, the proof was automatically added to an Express-specific project. 

For more information, see [Adobe Express and Workfront Proof integration](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/review-and-approval-integrations/wf-proof-and-express.md).

We've upgraded the asset selector in the Adobe Workfront for Experience Manager Assets integration. With this upgrade, you can now select and pull AEM Collections directly into Workfront.

## New version of Salesforce integration now available

>[!IMPORTANT]

>To deliver more stable and scalable integrations, we're shifting to a modern, flexible integration approach using Workfront Automation and Integration (Fusion). As part of this transition process, the Workfront for Salesforce integration, including the new version, will not be available after **February 28, 2026**.

>Preview: October 30, 2025 
>Production fast release: October 30, 2025  
>Production for everyone: October 30, 2025  

To stay up-to-date with recent changes to the Workfront API, we've created a new Salesforce integration. The new integration features the same functionality as the previous version, and was updated to avoid losing functionality deprecated in the API.

For instructions and links for downloading and installing the new integration, see [Install Adobe Workfront for Salesforce](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/install-workfront-for-salesforce.md).
