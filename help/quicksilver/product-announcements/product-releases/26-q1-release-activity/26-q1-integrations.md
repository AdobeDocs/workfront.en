We've upgraded the asset selector in the Adobe Workfront for Experience Manager Assets integration. With this upgrade, you can now select and pull AEM Collections directly into Workfront.

## New version of Salesforce integration now available

>To deliver more stable and scalable integrations, we're shifting to a modern, flexible integration approach using Workfront Automation and Integration (Fusion). As part of this transition process, the Workfront for Salesforce integration, including the new version, will not be available after **February 28, 2026**.

To stay up-to-date with recent changes to the Workfront API, we've created a new Salesforce integration. The new integration features the same functionality as the previous version, and was updated to avoid losing functionality deprecated in the API.

For instructions and links for downloading and installing the new integration, see [Install Adobe Workfront for Salesforce](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/install-workfront-for-salesforce.md).
