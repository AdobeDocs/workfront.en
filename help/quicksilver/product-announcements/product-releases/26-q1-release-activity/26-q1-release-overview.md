### Functionality soon to be removed from Workfront

#### Deprecation of the override currency on job roles with the 25.11 release

As part of the financial model simplification, we will be deprecating the override currency on job roles in Preview on October 30, and in Production for all customers with the 25.11 release. This change affects how currencies and rates are configured on job roles in the Setup area.

* The **Override Currency** fields on a job role will no longer be available.
* Each job role will have a single currency with its associated cost and billing rate.
* All existing override currencies and their rate values will be migrated automatically to become the sole currency and rates for that job role.

## Interface modernization

We are updating the interface throughout Adobe Workfront to improve the user experience and unify it with other Adobe applications. These changes are released outside the standard release schedule. For a list of these changes, see [Interface Modernization](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/interface-modernization/interface-modernization.md).

## Release notes for other areas

### Workfront Planning enhancements

New features in Workfront Planning are available in Production. For more information about the latest features, see [First Quarter 2026 release activity for Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/planning-release-activity/planning-release-activity-26-q1.md).

## Announcements

### API version 21

Workfront API version 21 was released on October 23, 2025. For API version 21, we've modified some resources and endpoints. Some of the changes support new functionality, and others make it easier for you to use the information available through the API.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This API version change features a breaking change that may affect your existing API calls. This is due to the fact that API version 21 uses Event Subscriptions version 2.
>
> For multi-select fields, Event Subsscriptions version 2 always sends as an array. Version 1 sent an array if more than one value selected. If only one value was selected, it sent a string.

For information on what's new and updated, see [What's new in API version 21](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/new-api-version-21.md).

For information on API versions, see [API versioning and support schedule](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/api-version-support-schedule.md).

### New version of Workfront for Microsoft Teams

As [Microsoft transitions to the New Teams client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability), the Classic Teams client will no longer be available after July 1, 2025. To continue using Microsoft Teams and integrated apps like Workfront, customers must transition to the New Teams client before this date. 

The updated Workfront integration is now available and fully compatible with the New Teams experience. In most cases, Workfront will appear automatically once users have transitioned. If it does not, the integration can be manually installed from the Microsoft Teams App Store. To install or verify the Workfront integration in the New Teams client, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for Microsoft Teams](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-microsoft-teams/install-workfront-ms-teams.md).

### Workfront for Microsoft Outlook

[Microsoft is in the process of disabling support for legacy Exchange online tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens), which are currently used by the Workfront Outlook add-in for authentication. This change by Microsoft has already started affecting customers and will continue to roll out in phases through October 2025.

* **After Microsoft fully disables these tokens, the Workfront for Microsoft Outlook integration will no longer function.** 

As part of this change, Microsoft has made the decision to change the way tokens are re-enabled. After **June 30, 2025**, admins will no longer be able to re-enable tokens themselves—only Microsoft Support can grant exceptions. **On October 1, 2025, legacy tokens will be turned off for all tenants. Exceptions will not be granted.**  

### Other Workfront integration transitions

To deliver more stable and scalable integrations, we're shifting to a modern, flexible integration approach using Workfront Automation and Integration (Fusion). As part of this transition process, the following integrations will not be available after **February 28, 2026**: 

* Workfront for G Suite 
* Workfront for Jira 
* Workfront for Salesforce. 

We recommend using Workfront Automation and Integration for your organization's integration needs with Google Workspace. 
For an overview of Workfront Automation and Integration, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/get-started-with-fusion/understand-workfront-fusion/workfront-fusion-overview).
