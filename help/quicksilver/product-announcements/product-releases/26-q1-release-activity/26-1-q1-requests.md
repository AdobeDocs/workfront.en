# First Quarter 2026 Requests enhancements

This page describes Requests enhancements made with the First Quarter 2026 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2026 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2026 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/26-q1-release-activity/26-q1-release-overview.md).

## Save drafts of requests in the new requesting experience

To make it easier to create and submit requests, we've added the ability to save drafts to the new requesting experience. Now, when you begin filling out a request and close it, the request is saved in Draft status and can be found in your request list. You can then reopen, update, and submit the draft at your convenience.

Previously, this feature was not available in the new requesting experience.

Drafts created in the legacy requesting experience are available in the new requesting experience. You can locate them in your request list.

For more information on request drafts, see [Create requests from drafts](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-requests-from-drafts.md).

## Delete submitted requests in the new requesting experience

To make it easier to keep your requests organized and uncluttered, we've added the ability to delete requests to the new requesting experience. Now, you can delete requests that you have submitted. Workfront Administrators and Workfront Planning Workspace administrators can also delete requests.

Previously, deleting requests was not available.

For information and instructions, see [Delete a submitted request or request draft](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/delete-request-draft.md).

## Share views in the Requests area and the My Requests widget

To make it easier to ensure to see the information you need, we've added the ability to share views to the new reporting experience. Now, you can share views with other users, teams, or groups.

You can share request list views from both the Requests area in Workfront and the My Requests widget in Home. Sharing functionality is identical in both places, and view settings, including sharing, are preserved when moving between the My Requests widget and the Requests area.

For information on request views, including sharing, see [Create and manage views in the Requests area](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-views-for-requests-list.md).

## Create new requests by copying previously submitted requests in the new requesting experience

To make it easier to submit requests, we've added the ability to copy requests to the new requesting experience. Now, you can copy a request, edit any fields, and submit it as a new request.

Previously, this functionality was not available in the new requesting experience.

For information on copying and submitting a request, see [Copy and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/copy-and-submit-requests.md).
