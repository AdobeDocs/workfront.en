# First Quarter 2026 Requests enhancements

This page describes Requests enhancements made with the First Quarter 2026 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2026 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2026 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/26-q1-release-activity/26-q1-release-overview.md).

## Created object links now available in the Requests area and My Requests widget

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: December 18, 2025 
>Production fast release: January 14, 2026  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026  

To make it easier for you to go to the object created by a specific request, we've added links to the Created object column. Now, you can click on the link in this column to be taken directly to the created object's page.

This link is available only for Planning requests, in cases where the request itself created an object. If a Workfront request is converted to a project or other object, a link to that converted object is not available in the request list in the new requesting experience.

Previously, this column contained only the name of the object, and not its link.

For information on locating these links, see:

* [Locate submitted requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/locate-submitted-requests.md)
* [Use the My Requests widget](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/my-requests-widget.md)

## Create groupings in the Requests list and My Requests widget

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: December 18, 2025 
>Production fast release: January 14, 2026  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026  

To make it easier for you to find the requests you need, we've added groupings to the Requests list and the My Requests widget. Now, you can group requests by any column on the list. These groupings become part of the view that you are using when you create the grouping.

For more information on creating views for the Request list and My Requests widget, including adding groupings, see [Create or edit views in the Requests area and My Requests widget](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-views-for-requests-list.md).

## Share views in the Requests area and the My Requests widget

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview: December 18, 2025 
>Production fast release: January 14, 2026  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026  

To make it easier to ensure to see the information you need, we've added the ability to share views to the new requesting experience. Now, you can share views with other users, teams, or groups.

For information on request views, including sharing, see [Create and manage views in the Requests area](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-views-for-requests-list.md).

## Add custom fields to Requests list and My Requests widget

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview: December 18, 2025 
>Production fast release: January 14, 2026  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026 

To make it easier for you to see the information you need, we've added the ability to add custom fields as columns on the Requests list and the My Requests widget in Home. Now, you can add fields from custom forms as a column, and requests that have information in that field will display that information in the list or widget.

This functionality is available only in the new Requests experience.

Previously, custom fields were not available in the Requests list or My Requests widget.

For instructions on adding columns, see:

* [Create or edit views in the Requests area](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-views-for-requests-list.md)
* [Use the My Requests widget](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/my-requests-widget.md)

## Current user wildcard now available in Requests filter

>Production fast release: January 14, 2026  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026 

To make it easier to filter for requests that apply to you, we've created a current user wildcard. Now, when filtering, you can select "Me (logged in user)." The filter will then apply to the user who is viewing the request list. 

This can be convenient when adding a filter to a view that multiple users will use. Each user will see filter results that apply to them.

The wildcard is available in fields where the value is a user.

For more information on configuring views in the Requests list, including filters, see [Create or edit views in the Requests area](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-views-for-requests-list.md).

## Form Fill powered by AI now available for requests

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: December 11, 2025 
>Production fast release: December 11, 2025  
>Production for everyone: December 11, 2025  

To make it easier to create requests, we've created Form Fill powered by AI. Now, you can paste in a prompt or upload a document to a request form, and AI will pull out the relevant information and fill in the form. 

Your organization must have AI enabled to access this functionality.

For more information on Form Fill powered by AI, including what is required to enable AI for your organization, see [Use Form Fill powered by AI to fill in a request using prompts or documents](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/autofill-from-prompt-document.md).


## Save drafts of requests in the new requesting experience

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: November 20, 2025 
>Production fast release: January 14, 2026  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026  

To make it easier to create and submit requests, we've added the ability to save drafts to the new requesting experience. Now, when you begin filling out a request and close it, the request is saved in Draft status and can be found on the request form used to create the draft. You can then reopen, update, and submit the draft at your convenience.

Previously, this feature was not available in the new requesting experience.

For more information on request drafts, see [Create requests from drafts](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-requests-from-drafts.md).

## Delete submitted requests in the new requesting experience

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: November 20, 2025 
>Production fast release: January 14, 2026  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026  

To make it easier to keep your requests organized and uncluttered, we've added the ability to delete requests to the new requesting experience. Now, you can delete requests that you have submitted. Workfront Administrators and Workfront Planning Workspace administrators can also delete requests.

Previously, this feature was not available in the new requesting experience.

For information and instructions, see [Delete a submitted request or request draft](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/delete-request-draft.md).


## Create new requests by copying previously submitted requests in the new requesting experience

>Preview: November 20, 2025 
>Production fast release: December 11, 2025  
>Production for everyone: January 15, 2026  

To make it easier to submit requests, we've added the ability to copy requests to the new requesting experience. Now, you can copy a request, edit any fields, and submit it as a new request.

Previously, this functionality was not available in the new requesting experience.

For information on copying and submitting a request, see [Copy and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/copy-and-submit-requests.md).
