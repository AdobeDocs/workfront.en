## Update to the Mentions widget in Home 

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: December 17, 2025 
>Production fast release: January 14, 2026 
>Production for all: January 15, 2026 

We have made the following improvements to the Mentions widget in home:  

* The same experience in the Updates area of most Workfront objects is now also available in the Mentions widget in Home. Prior to this enhancement, the legacy commenting experience was available in these areas.   

* The Mentions widget now contains the comments that the user made or has been tagged in for the past two weeks. Prior to this update, the widget displayed comments made on tasks and issues that you were assigned to, that you assigned to another user, that you owned, that you were the primary contact on, or that you created and that had been updated in the last 30 days.
