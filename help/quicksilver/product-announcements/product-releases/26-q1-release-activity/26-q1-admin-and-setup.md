# First Quarter 2026 Administrator enhancements

This page describes Administrator enhancements made with the First Quarter 2026 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2026 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2026 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/26-q1-release-activity/26-q1-release-overview.md).

The entry date and entered by ID are now stored on custom forms, fields, and sections. You can use these data options in reports as filters, views, or groupings. To display them in the list of custom forms, fields, or sections in Setup, add Entry Date and Entered By: Name as columns in a new or existing view.


## Updates to button names when editing a layout template

To provide more consistency with other areas of Setup such as the custom form designer, the buttons you see when editing a layout template have changed to **Apply**, **Save and Close**, and **Cancel**. The new option, **Apply**, allows you to save your changes to the layout template and continue editing. Previously, the available options were **Save** and **Cancel**.

For more information, see [Create and manage layout templates](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).



## Improved field management with Active flag on custom fields

When you have large numbers of custom fields in the system, management of those fields in custom forms and reports can be difficult. You can now mark custom fields inactive with the new **Active** flag. This flag is available when working with a field on a custom form or when adding or editing a field from the Fields list.

If you mark a field inactive:

* It is excluded from reports, filters, views, or other places in Workfront where you can add a custom field
* It is not available in the field library to add to other custom forms

For more information, see [Create a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).
