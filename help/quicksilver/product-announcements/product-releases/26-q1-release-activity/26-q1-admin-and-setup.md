When you have large numbers of custom fields in the system, management of those fields in custom forms and reports can be difficult. You can now mark custom fields inactive with the new **Active** flag. This flag is available when working with a field on a custom form or when adding or editing a field from the Fields list.

If you mark a field inactive:

* It is excluded from reports, filters, views, or other places in Workfront where you can add a custom field
* It is not available in the field library to add to other custom forms
