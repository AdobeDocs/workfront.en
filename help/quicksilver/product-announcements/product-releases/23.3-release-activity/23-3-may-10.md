## Map Workfront field values to tags in Experience Manager Assets

Now, you can categorize and quickly find assets based on data from Workfront. You can map this data as part of your metadata configuration in the Workfront for Experience Manager Assets integration.

Previously, mapping Workfront data to Experience Manager Assets tags was unavailable.

For more information on this functionality in Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service, see [Configure the [!UICONTROL Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service] integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md).
For more information on this functionality in Experience Manager Assets Essentials, see [Configure the Experience Manager Assets Essentials integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/setup-asset-essentials.md).

## Map Workfront fields to custom Experience Manager Assets metadata fields

With the native integration, you can now map both native and built-in Workfront fields to custom metadata schema fields in Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service.

For more information on this functionality in Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service, see [Configure the [!UICONTROL Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service] integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-aacs-integration.md).
