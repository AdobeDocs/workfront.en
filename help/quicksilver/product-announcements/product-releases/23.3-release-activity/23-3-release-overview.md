                        <p>To allow you to receive new Workfront product features and updates more quickly, we've added the ability to enable faster release cycles. Now, you can choose to have your organization receive Workfront releases more frequently than once a quarter. The quarterly release cycle will still be available for organizations that prefer less frequent releases.</p>

#### Deprecation of the Proof mobile app with 23.4

We will be officially deprecating the Proof mobile app with the 23.4 release. The general Workfront mobile app has been enhanced with new proofing functionality (see the release note under Workfront Mobile enhancements for more information), and users are advised to begin using it for proofing work as soon as possible.

Note that the Workfront mobile app requires a Workfront login. External users and guests can continue to use the Proof app for proofing work; however, it is no longer supported and will become unavailable with 23.4.
