# Look and feel updates during the 23.3 release time frame

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the 23.3  release timeframe. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment a minimum of 2 weeks after releasing to Preview.

For a list of all changes available with the 23.3 release, see [23.3  Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Interface improvements for requests lists

We have made improvements to the interface of the Submitted requests list.

The improvements are:

* there is now a loading indicator when the page uploads;
* the Copy icon is persistent and accompanied by text and it becomes disabled when no requests are selected.

For more information, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).

## Updated design when submitting a new request

We have updated the New request box which displays when submitting a new request. Now, the interface matches the New issue box which displays when adding a new issue to a project.
