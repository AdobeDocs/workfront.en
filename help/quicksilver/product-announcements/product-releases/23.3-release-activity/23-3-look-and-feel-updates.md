# Look and feel updates during the 23.3 release time frame

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the 23.3 release timeframe. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment a minimum of 2 weeks after releasing to Preview.

For a list of all changes available with the 23.3 release, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Interface improvements for requests lists

>[!NOTE]
>
>Planned Preview release: June 29, 2023; Planned Production release: July 13, 2023

We have made improvements to the interface of the Submitted requests list.

The improvements are:

* there is now a loading indicator when the page uploads;
* the Copy icon is persistent and accompanied by text and it becomes disabled when no requests are selected.

For more information, see [Copy and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/copy-and-submit-requests.md). The documentation will be updated after the feature releases. 

## Updated design when adding a new issue to a project

>Planned Preview release: July 27, 2023; Planned production for fast release: With the 23.8 release. Planned production for quarterly release: With the 23.10 release 
>
>This feature was originally planned to release with the 23.3 release and it was later delayed. 

We have updated the New Issue box which displays when submitting a new issue to a project. Now, the interface matches the New request box which displays when submitting a new request to a request queue.

For more information, see [Create issues](../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/create-issues.md). The documentation will be updated after the feature releases. 

## Updated Billing Rates list

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 29, 2023; Planned Production release for the Fast release customers: To be announced, after the 23.3 Production release; Planned Production release for all customers: With the 23.4 release

The Project Billing Rates list now has the more modern look and feel found in most other lists throughout Workfront.
