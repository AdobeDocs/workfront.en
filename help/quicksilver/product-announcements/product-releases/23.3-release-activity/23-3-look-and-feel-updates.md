# Look and feel updates during the 23.3 release time frame

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the 23.3  release timeframe. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment a minimum of 2 weeks after releasing to Preview.

For a list of all changes available with the 23.3 release, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Interface improvements for requests lists

>[!NOTE]

>Planned Preview release: June 28, 2023; Planned Production release: July 13, 2023

We have made improvements to the interface of the Submitted requests list.

The improvements are:

* there is now a loading indicator when the page uploads;
* the Copy icon is persistent and accompanied by text and it becomes disabled when no requests are selected.

For more information, see [Copy and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/copy-and-submit-requests.md).

## Updated design when submitting a new request

>[!NOTE]

>Planned Preview release: July 5, 2023; Planned Production release: with the 23.3 release

We have updated the New request box which displays when submitting a new request. Now, the interface matches the New issue box which displays when adding a new issue to a project.

For more information, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).

## Updated Billing Rates list

>[!NOTE]

>Preview release: June 29, 2023; Planned Production release for the Fast release customers: To be announced, after the 23.3 Production release; Planned Production release for all customers: With the 23.4 release

The Project Billing Rates list now has the more modern look and feel found in most other lists throughout Workfront.
