# 23.3 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the 23.3 release. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release on July 20 and 21, 2023.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3 release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Enable faster Workfront release cycles

To allow you to receive new Workfront product features and updates more quickly, we've added the ability to enable faster release cycles. Now, you can choose to have your organization receive Workfront releases more frequently than once a quarter. The quarterly release cycle will still be available for organizations that prefer less frequent releases.

Previously, features and functionality were released on a quarterly cycle for all customers.

For more information, see [Enable or disable the fast release process](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/enable-fast-release-process.md).

## Group-level control available for "Where users can log time" timesheet and hour preference

The system administrator can now lock and unlock the "Where users can log time" timesheet and hour preference. When this preference is unlocked, group administrators can configure the "Where users can log time" settings separately for each group.

For more information, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md) and [Configure timesheet and hour preferences for a group](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-timesheet-hour-preferences-group.md).

## Display logic and skip logic indicators and rules displayed in the form designer beta

The form designer public beta was re-enabled in Preview and Production on July 21, 2023. The new form designer has a new canvas-style workspace that allows you to view the fields, canvas, and field settings all at the same time.
In addition, when you open a custom form in the form designer beta that contains display or skip logic created in the legacy form builder, you can now view the logic:

* Icons on a field in the form designer canvas indicate that logic is configured on that field, or that the field is used in logic rules configured on other fields.
* Selecting a field with logic applied displays the existing logic rules in the field settings.

Editing existing logic and adding new logic to a custom form are not yet available in the form designer beta, but are planned for the future.

For more information, see [Custom forms overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/custom-forms-overview.md).
