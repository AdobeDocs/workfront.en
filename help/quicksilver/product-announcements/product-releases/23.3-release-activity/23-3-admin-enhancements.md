# 23.3 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the 23.3 release. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release on July 20 and 21, 2023.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3 release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Enable faster Workfront release cycles

To allow you to receive new Workfront product features and updates more quickly, we've added the ability to enable faster release cycles. Now, you can choose to have your organization receive Workfront releases more frequently than once a quarter. The quarterly release cycle will still be available for organizations that prefer less frequent releases.

Previously, features and functionality were released on a quarterly cycle for all customers.

For more information, see [Enable or disable the fast release process](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/enable-fast-release-process.md).

## Group-level control available for "Where users can log time" timesheet and hour preference

The system administrator can now lock and unlock the "Where users can log time" timesheet and hour preference. When this preference is unlocked, group administrators can configure the "Where users can log time" settings separately for each group.

For more information, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md) and [Configure timesheet and hour preferences for a group](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-timesheet-hour-preferences-group.md).
