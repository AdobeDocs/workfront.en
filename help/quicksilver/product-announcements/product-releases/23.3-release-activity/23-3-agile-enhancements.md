# 23.3 Agile enhancements

This page describes all agile enhancements made with the 23.3 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3 release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Enhancements to the Boards tag manager

The tag manager interface has been improved, allowing you to create new tags quickly and apply them to cards. You can also create tags for workstreams.

For more information, see [Add tags](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/add-tags.md).

## Simple filters available on board intake columns

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards.

Simplified filters have been added to the intake column setup to allow you to define the intake column more quickly. The available filters are Workfront projects and assignments by team or user. You can switch to the advanced filters if you prefer.

For more information, see [Add an intake column to a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/add-intake-column-to-board.md).

## Simple filters added to dynamic board template

>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards.

The filters on the dynamic board template have been simplified to allow you to create a board more quickly. The available filters are Workfront projects and assignments by team or user. You can switch to the advanced filters if you prefer. These filter options are also in the Configure panel for dynamic boards.

For more information, see [Create or edit a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).

## Dynamic board template

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards.

A new template, dynamic board, is now available for standalone boards. This template is not available for boards inside of a workstream.

The dynamic board allows you to automatically populate a board with cards based on a Workfront project. Using filters, cards are added to columns based on their status.

For more information, see [Create or edit a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/create-edit-board.md).

## Migrate agile team Kanban cards to Boards

A new **Add to Boards** button on agile team Kanban boards allows you to add all cards from the Kanban board to a Workfront board. You can choose to create a new Workfront board or add the cards to an existing board.

The placement of cards on the Workfront board is based on column policies. (For example, a policy could move all cards with a status of "In Progress" to a specific column.) If there are no policies or the cards don't match the policies, the cards are placed in the leftmost column. At this time, cards in the Backlog column on the legacy board are not added to the Workfront board.

The cards are not removed from the agile team Kanban board, and card status changes will sync to both boards. You can keep both boards active until you are ready to switch to Workfront Boards.

For more information, see [Migrate agile team Kanban cards to Workfront boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/use-boards-agile-planning-tools/migrate-kanban-cards-to-boards.md).

## Left navigation added to card details on Boards

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards.

As more field options are added to cards on Workfront Boards, the card details have grown longer. A new navigation panel on the left of the card details allows you to select a section and move automatically to that group of fields.

Also, you can now add URLs in the Description field and they will become clickable links when the card details are saved. These updates apply to both ad hoc and connected cards.

For more information, see [Add an ad hoc card to a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/add-card-to-board.md) and [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).

## Boards email notifications and preferences

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards. Because email notifications are generally not used in Preview, this feature was released to Preview and Production (for early feature opt-in customers only) at the same time.

Email notifications are now available for Adobe Workfront Boards. The notifications are turned on by default and you can select in your preferences which emails you want to receive. You will receive an email when you are added to a board and when a card is assigned to you.

For more information, see [Boards email notifications and preferences](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/boards-emails.md).
