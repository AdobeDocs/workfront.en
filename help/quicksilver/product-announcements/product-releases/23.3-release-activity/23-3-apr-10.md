## Boards email notifications and preferences

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards. Because email notifications are generally not used in Preview, this feature was released to Preview and Production (for early feature opt-in customers only) at the same time.

Email notifications are now available for Adobe Workfront Boards. The notifications are turned on by default and you can select in your preferences which emails you want to receive. You will receive an email when you are added to a board and when a card is assigned to you.

For more information, see [Boards email notifications and preferences](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/boards-emails.md).
