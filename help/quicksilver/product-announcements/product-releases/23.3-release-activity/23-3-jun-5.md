# 23.3 release activity week of June 5, 2023

This page describes all enhancements made with the 23.3 release to the Preview environment the week of June 5, 2023. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Changing support for Microsoft Office proofs

To maintain a robust and scalable proof processing solution, we are changing our supported Microsoft Office file types and file size limits.

The following Office file types are no longer supported as proofs:
XLT, XLTX, DOT, DOTX, POT, POTX, PPS, PPSX

Users can continue creating proofs for the following Office file types:
DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX

The PowerPoint and Word file size limit is now 512MB.

For more information, see [Supported proofing file types and size limits overview](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/supported-proofing-file-types.md).

## Improved experience when moving a document to a linked folder with drag and drop

We've added some transparency to the process of dragging and dropping a document into a linked folder. Now, the document that you moved to a linked folder remains in the document list until it has fully moved. The document options are disabled, but you can still open the document for view while it is moving. When the document has completed the transfer, it disappears from the document list, because it is now fully located in the linked folder.

Previously, documents would immediately disappear from the document list, before they had finished moving to the linked folder.

For more information, see [Link documents from external applications](/help/quicksilver/documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).
