## New proof functionality in the Workfront mobile app

>[!NOTE]
>
>These features will be generally available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store on June 21, 2023.

With the deprecation of the standalone Workfront Proof app in 23.4, the primary Workfront mobile app has had  proofing features added to allow for proofing on mobile to continue. New functionality includes:

* The Workfront mobile app now supports all static file types for proofs
* Proof status can be viewed from the Document Details and Proof Details pages in the mobile app
* Buttons that navigate users to the Workfront Proof app have been removed

For more information on proofing in the Workfront mobile app, see [Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md).
