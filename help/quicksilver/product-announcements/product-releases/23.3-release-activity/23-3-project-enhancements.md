# 23.3 Project enhancements

This page describes all project enhancements made with the 23.3 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3 release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Date effective cost and billing rates

Date effective cost and billing rates are now available on the company, user, and job role objects in Workfront. When date effective rates are applied to a project, and hours are logged on project tasks, the costs and revenue are calculated using the specified rates for each time period.

Also, date effective job role sets are now available on the user profile. These date effective role associations are considered in financial calculations if the user's job role changes during a project.

A new feature, rate cards, allows you to define multiple billing rates per job role, based on location. A billing rate for a job role and location can also include effective dates. Rate cards can be attached to projects to apply all of the rate information at once for the specific job role and location. Location based roles can also be assigned to tasks with a possibility to override their rates on the assignment level.

All of these features will be released to Preview in July 2023, and updated user documentation will be available at that time.

## New document approvals

Document approvals are being redesigned in a phased rollout that will be made available to more users with each release.

In this first release, the approval process has been streamlined for both creating approvals and approving/reviewing documents, in addition to new functionality. Specific enhancements include:

* Improved interface for adding approvers and reviewers
* Add individuals or entire teams as approvers
* Make approval decisions directly from My Updates and Home
* Create approvals for specific document versions

For more information on using the new document approvals, see [Document reviews and approvals](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/document-reviews-and-approvals.html?lang=en).
