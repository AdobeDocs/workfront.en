# 23.3 Project enhancements

This page describes all project enhancements made with the 23.3 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3 release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## New document approvals

Document approvals are being redesigned in a phased rollout that will be made available to more users with each release.

In this first release, the approval process has been streamlined for both creating approvals and approving/reviewing documents, in addition to new functionality. Specific enhancements include:

* Improved interface for adding approvers and reviewers
* Add individuals or entire teams as approvers
* Make approval decisions directly from My Updates and Home
* Create approvals for specific document versions

For more information on using the new document approvals, see [New Document Approvals overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/document-approvals-overview.html).

## New Share button

The Share option has been pulled out of the More menu for projects, tasks, and issues to make sharing more intuitive. The new Share button is now displayed next to an object's name just before the More menu. Sharing documents, portfolios, and programs remains unchanged.

For more information on sharing objects, see [Share an object](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/basics/grant-request-object-permissions/share-an-object.html).
