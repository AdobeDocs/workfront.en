# 23.3 Other enhancements

This page describes all other enhancements made with the 23.3 release. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release on July 20 and 21, 2023. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3 release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.3-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## New Home experience

To better enable users of all types to utilize Workfront for their specific needs, Home has received a major update! The New Home experience offers visual and content customization for your Home page, providing the flexibility to display only the information that is most relevant to your work. With New Home, you can:

* Select from an array of productivity widgets that contain the information that's most important to you, complete with relevant tools you can access directly from certain widgets
* Customize the look and layout of your Home page; personalize your Home with a colorful banner or by moving and resizing widgets on the dynamic canvas as you see fit
* Filter widget information based on when work is due, create custom to-do lists, and more!

New Home is a major new feature that we are excited to continue developing and improving. Please share your experience using the New Home with us through the in-app feedback button.

New Home will be the default experience for all users upon its release. However, you can choose to revert to the existing Home experience as we continue developing its capabilities.

For more information, see [Get started with New Home in Adobe Workfront](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## New commenting experience for additional objects

The new commenting experience will be available for the following objects, shortly after the 23.3 release to Production: template tasks, templates, timesheets, teams, users, programs, portfolios.  

This will be the only commenting experience for these objects, as the legacy commenting experience is removed.

For more information, see [New commenting experience release activity](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/new-commenting-beta-experience-release-activity.md).

## New commenting Beta experience for projects, tasks, and issues

The new commenting Beta experience is now available for projects, tasks, and documents. Prior to this update, the commenting Beta experience was available only for issues and goals.

For information about the features currently available in the commenting Beta experience, see [New commenting beta experience release activity](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/new-commenting-beta-experience-release-activity.md).

## Profiles without avatars now display user initials

To make it easier to find specific users within large lists, profiles without customized avatars now display the user's initials on a colored background in lists and legacy reports. This is a minor cosmetic change, and does not apply if an avatar photo is already being used or the user is deactivated.

For more information on editing user profiles, see [Edit a user's profile](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).
