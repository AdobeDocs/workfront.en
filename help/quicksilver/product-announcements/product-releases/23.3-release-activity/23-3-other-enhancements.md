# 23.3 Other enhancements

This page describes all other enhancements made with the 23.3 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.3 release cycle, see [23.3 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-3-release-overview.md).

## Home page

release note

## New commenting experience for additional objects

The new commenting experience will be available for the following objects, shortly after the 23.3 release to Production: template tasks, templates, timesheets, teams, users, program, portfolios.  

This will be the only commenting experience for these objects, as the legacy commenting experience is removed.  

With this change, the new commenting experience will also be the default experience for issues, projects, tasks, and documents. The legacy commenting experience will also be available for these objects.   

For more information, see [New commenting experience release activity](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/new-commenting-beta-experience-release-activity.md).

## New commenting Beta experience for projects, tasks, and issues

The new commenting Beta experience is now available for projects, tasks, and documents. Prior to this update, the commenting Beta experience was available only for issues and goals.

For information about the features currently available in the commenting Beta experience, see [New commenting beta experience release activity](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/new-commenting-beta-experience-release-activity.md).

## Profiles without avatars now display user initials

To make it easier to find specific users within large lists, profiles without customized avatars now display the user's initials on a colored background in lists and legacy reports. This is a minor cosmetic change, and does not apply if an avatar photo is already being used or the user is deactivated.

For more information on editing user profiles, see [Edit a user's profile](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).
