## Maintenance Updates for limited availability features

This section describes the issues fixed in the weekly Workfront updates for limited availability features.

### Maintenance Updates week of November 23-29, 2025

**Hour / FTE / Percentage removed from Advanced Search on Advanced Assignments**

On the Advanced Assignments Advanced Search, selecting an option for **Hour / FTE / Percentage** did not change the search display. The dropdown has been removed from the toolbar.

**Planned hours not editable on Advanced Assignments when the task duration is 0**

The Planned Hours KPI on the Advanced Assignments screen is no longer editable when the task duration is 0. Previously, you could edit the planned hours but the changes were not saved.

### Maintenance Updates week of November 30-December 6, 2025

**Exchange Rate Date field hidden when date-effective exchange rates are not used**

The **Exchange Rate Date** field in the Project Details > Finance area is now hidden when the **Use date-effective exchange rates from the system** check box is not selected. Previously, when editing a project, the date field was displayed on the project details even when date-effective exchange rates were not enabled.
