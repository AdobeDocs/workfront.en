For a list of all limited availability features released for Adobe Workfront, see [Adobe Workfront limited availability features release activity: article index](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/limited-availability-release-activity/limited-availability-release-activity-article-index.md).

## Release notes for limited availability features

This section includes the release notes for new functionality.

### Adjust job role rates in rate cards

>[!NOTE]
>
>Production release date: November 20, 2025

You can now apply percentage-based changes to one or more job role billing rates within a rate card. Instead of manually updating each rate one by one, you can apply changes to all selected rates in a single operation.

### KPI limitations in advanced search

>[!NOTE]
>
>Production release date: December 18, 2025

To improve usability of the advanced search in Advanced Assignments and staffing plans, the list of KPIs you can display in the table columns is now limited. Showing only the key metrics helps you find information more quickly.

* In the Advanced Assignments advanced search, the **Available Capacity** KPI is available. This metric represents the base total capacity of users.
* In the staffing plan advanced search, the **Remaining Staffing Allocation Capacity** KPI is available. This metric reflects how much capacity is still available after allocations.

## Maintenance Updates for limited availability features

This section describes the issues fixed in the weekly Workfront updates for limited availability features.

### Maintenance Updates week of November 23-29, 2025

**Hour / FTE / Percentage removed from Advanced Search on Advanced Assignments**

On the Advanced Assignments Advanced Search, selecting an option for **Hour / FTE / Percentage** did not change the search display. The dropdown has been removed from the toolbar.

**Planned hours not editable on Advanced Assignments when the task duration is 0**

The Planned Hours KPI on the Advanced Assignments screen is no longer editable when the task duration is 0. Previously, you could edit the planned hours but the changes were not saved.

### Maintenance Updates week of November 30-December 6, 2025

**Exchange Rate Date field hidden when date-effective exchange rates are not used**

The **Exchange Rate Date** field in the Project Details > Finance area is now hidden when the **Use date-effective exchange rates from the system** check box is not selected. Previously, when editing a project, the date field was displayed on the project details even when date-effective exchange rates were not enabled.
