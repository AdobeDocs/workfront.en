# Workfront Library release activity - June 19, 2019

This page describes all changes made available to Workfront Library with the release to the Production environment on June 19.

For a list of all changes made to Workfront Library, see [Workfront Library release activity](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/library-release-activity/workfront-library-release-activity.md).

The Workfront Library release on June 19 contains the following enhancements:

## Cover Images Display for Collections

Now you can add a cover image to a collection to make it easier to identify its contents. When you create a collection, you can select the cover image using the thumbnail of any asset in Workfront Library . For more information, see [Create a collection in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/collections/create-a-collection.md).

If you don't select a cover image for a collection, Workfront Library selects a cover image based on the items contained in the collection. You can change the cover image for collections to which you have Manage permissions. For more information, see [Change the cover image on an item in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/change-cover-image-of-folder.md).
