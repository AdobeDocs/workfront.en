# Adobe Workfront Goals 23.2 release activity: Week of March 20, 2023

This page describes all enhancements made with the 23.2 release for Adobe Workfront Goals to the Preview environment on March 20, 2023. 

These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.2 release, which is scheduled for the week of April 3, 2023.

## Goals improvements to the commenting experience

Starting with the 23.1 release, we have introduced a new commenting experience for Workfront Goals. For information about the 23.1 Workfront Goals updates, see [Adobe Workfront Goals with the 23.1 release](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/goals-release-activity/goals-23-1-release/goals-23-1-release.md).

Starting with the 23.2 release, the commenting experience for goals will match the new commenting experience Beta which was released for issues. We continue to release updates in this area during all releases in 2023. 

For information about what features are available in the commenting experience Beta, see [New commenting experience](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/unified-commenting-experience.md).
