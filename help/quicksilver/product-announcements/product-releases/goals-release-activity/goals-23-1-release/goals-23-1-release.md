                        <p>To create a more consistent experience with the rest of Workfront, as well as make it easier to view and work with your goals, we've made some updates to Workfront Goals. The look and feel of Workfront Goals is now more similar to to other areas in Workfront. Now, areas such as the header, lists, and details cards are familiar and consistent with your experience in Workfront.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we've replaced the areas currently available in the left navigation with the following:
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Objective details</b>: View information such as the goal's description, progress, dates, and parent objective information.</li>
                        <li><b>Progress indicators</b>: View progress indicators in a list. You can edit these indicators inline, open edit windows, or delete the indicators from this area.</li>
                        <li><b>Updates</b>: View, post, or reply to updates on the goal, similar to the Updates area in other Workfront objects.</li>    
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>For more information on Workfront Goals, see the articles available in the <a href="/help/quicksilver/workfront-goals/workfront-goals.md">Workfront Goals</a> area of the Workfront Documentation.</p>
