## Goals notifications integrated with Workfront user profile notifications

To allow you to manage your email notifications in one place, we have moved the notifications related to events occurring in Workfront Goals to the user profile area of Workfront. With this update, the Settings section in Workfront Goals has been removed and a new Goals category has been added to the Notifications area of your user profile. Notifications that you had enabled in the Settings area of Workfront Goals have been enabled by default in Workfront as instant notifications.

For more information, see [Notifications: Goals](../../../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/notifications-goals.md).
