## Eliminate the “My Teams” tab for users without teams

To eliminate the confusion of displaying an empty tab, we have removed the "My Teams" tab from users who are not assigned to any teams. Prior to this change, if a user didn't belong to any teams, the My Teams tab was empty.

For information about what information displays in Workfront Goals, see [Filter information in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../../../workfront-goals/goal-management/filter-information-wf-goals.md).
