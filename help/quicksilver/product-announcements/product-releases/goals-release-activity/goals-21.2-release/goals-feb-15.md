# Adobe Workfront Goals 21.2 release activity:&nbsp;Week of February 15, 2021

This page describes all enhancements made with the 21.2 release for Adobe Workfront Goals to the Preview environment the week of February 15, 2021. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment in the first quarter of 21.2.

For a list of all changes available for Workfront Goals at this point in the 21.2 release cycle, see [Adobe Workfront Goals with the 21.2 release](../../../../product-announcements/product-releases/goals-release-activity/goals-21.2-release/goals-release-21-2.md).

## Temporarily show filtered goals in the Alignment Chart

When viewing goals in the Alignment Chart, you can now temporarily display the goals that do not match the filter so you can get the full picture of all aligned goals. You can also reapply the filter and return to the filtered goals.

Prior to this enhancement, there was an indication that some goals are removed by the filter, but you could not view them.

For information about the Alignment Chart, see [Navigate the Goal Alignment section in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/navigate-goal-alignment-chart.md).
