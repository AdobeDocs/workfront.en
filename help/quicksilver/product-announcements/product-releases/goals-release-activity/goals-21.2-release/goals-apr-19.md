This page describes all enhancements made with the 21.2 release for Adobe Workfront Goals to the Preview environment the week of April 19, 2021. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment in the first quarter of 21.2.

For a list of all changes available for Workfront Goals at this point in the 21.2 release cycle, see [Adobe Workfront Goals with the 21.2 release](../../../../product-announcements/product-releases/goals-release-activity/goals-21.2-release/goals-release-21-2.md).

## Edit goals from past periods in Workfront Goals

>[!NOTE]
>
>Available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

To help you manage your goals more efficiently, we have introduced an enhancement that allows you to edit goals from any time period, including past goals. Prior to this enhancement, you could only update or create goals within the current or a future time frame.

For information about editing and creating goals, see:

* [Edit goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../../../workfront-goals/goal-management/edit-goals.md) 
* [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md)

## An updated Goal List for Workfront Goals

>[!NOTE]
>
>Available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

To create a cohesive experience for you, we have introduced several updates to the Goal List in Workfront Goals. The new list looks and feels closer to the rest of the Workfront lists. Some improvements that you can see in the new Goal list include:

* Collapsing and expanding the goals is managed from the upper-left icon in the toolbar. The “Expand goals” icon has been removed.
* The functionality of the filters matches that in the Goal Alignment section. You can temporarily show items hidden by the filter, then reapply it to exclude them from displaying.
* The name of some of the columns has been updated.

The experience of opening the Goal Details panel in the list is closer to working with the Summary panel in Workfront.

For information about reviewing goals in the Goal List, see [Manage goals in the Goal List of Adobe Workfront Goals](../../../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/manage-goals-in-goal-list.md).

## Share a goal in Workfront Goals

>[!NOTE]
>
>Available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

You can now share a goal you create or which was shared with you and control who has access to manage the goal. Prior to this enhancement, all users had access to view and manage all goals in the system. Now, they can view all goals in the system by default, but they can only manage goals they have been given permissions to or goals they created.

For information about sharing goals, see [Share a goal in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../../../workfront-goals/workfront-goals-settings/share-a-goal.md).
