  </tr> Edit goals from past periods in Workfront Goals New in Preview! To help you manage your goals more efficiently, we have introduced an enhancement that allows you to edit goals from any time period, including past goals. Prior to this enhancement, you could only update or create goals within the current or a future time frame. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 22, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience An updated Goal List for Workfront Goals New in Preview! To create a cohesive experience for you, we have introduced several updates to the Goal List in Workfront Goals. The new list looks and feels closer to the rest of the Workfront lists. Some improvements that you can see in the new Goal list include: Collapsing and expanding the goals is managed from the upper-left icon in the toolbar. The “Expand goals” icon has been removed. The functionality of the filters matches that in the Goal Alignment section. You can temporarily show items hidden by the filter, then reapply it to exclude them from displaying. The name of some of the columns has been updated. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 22, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Share a goal in Workfront Goals New in Preview! You can now share a goal you create or which was shared with you and control who has access to manage the goal. Prior to this enhancement, all users had access to view and manage all goals in the system. Now, they can view all goals in the system by default, but they can only manage goals they have been given permissions to or goals they created. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 22, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Report on goal information You can now build Goal reports or Project reports that include information about associated goals in Workfront. Your company must purchase and enable Workfront Goals, but once they do, you can build the reports in both the new Workfront experience as well as Workfront classic. To see goal information in reports, you can now create a goal report and create a project report that displays goal information. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 8, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Temporarily show filtered goals in the Alignment Chart When viewing goals in the Alignment Chart, you can now temporarily display the goals that do not match the filter so you can get the full picture of all aligned goals. You can also reapply the filter and return to the filtered goals. Prior to this enhancement, there was an indication that some goals are removed by the filter, but you could not view them. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: February 18, 2021 Production release: March 4, 2021 Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience
