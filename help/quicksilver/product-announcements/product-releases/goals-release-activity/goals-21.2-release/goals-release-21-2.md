    <ul> 
     <li> <p>Collapsing and expanding the goals is managed from the upper-left icon in the toolbar. The “Expand goals” icon has been removed.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>The functionality of the filters matches that in the Goal Alignment section. You can temporarily show items hidden by the filter, then reapply it to exclude them from displaying.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>The name of some of the columns has been updated.</p> </li>
