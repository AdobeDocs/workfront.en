# Other enhancements during the Second Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q2-release-activity/25-q2-release-overview.md).

## Represent Adobe Admin Console user changes as "System" in the Workfront update feed

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: January 23, 2025; Production for fast release: With the 25.2 release (February 2025); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.4 release (April 2025)

Now, when the administrator of the Adobe Admin Console makes a change to the user information of a Workfront user, Workfront records this change in the System activity tab of the user's Updates area as belonging to the "System". This refers to the Adobe Admin Console administrator.  

Prior to this update, user changes made by the administrator of the Admin Console were recorded as made by the main Workfront system administrator.   

For information about managing users in the Adobe Admin Console, see [Manage users in the Adobe Admin Console](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/admin-console.md)
