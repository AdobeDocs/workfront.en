## New document approval decision buttons available in proofing viewer

The new document approval decision buttons now appear in the proofing viewer. Now, when you create a simple proof and then add approvers and reviewers from the Document summary, they can make their decision directly inside the proofing viewer.

Previously, you had to exit the proofing viewer to make a decision.

Approvals created before this release will not display the buttons in proofing viewer.
