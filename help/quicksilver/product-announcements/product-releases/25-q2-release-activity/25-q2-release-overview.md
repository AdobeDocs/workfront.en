### Functionality soon to be removed from Workfront

The following functionality is soon to be removed from Workfront:

#### API version 2-15 deprecation

As we continue to enhance the Workfront platform, it is crucial to keep our APIs up to date. This ensures optimal performance and security, and supports new capabilities. Therefore, we are deprecating Workfront API versions 2-15. 

* **September 2025**: API versions 2-14, which are currently unsupported, will be deprecated. After this date, these versions will no longer be accessible.
* **December 2025**: API version 15 will be deprecated.

#### We are removing the legacy Agile view in a project

The legacy Agile view in a project will be removed from Workfront with the 25.3 release on March 13, 2025. You will still be able to view your tasks in an Agile view in a project by clicking on the Boards icon.

For more information about using the Agile view, see [Manage a project in the Agile View](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/manage-projects/manage-projects-in-agile-view.md).

#### Enhanced Analytics deprecation

Due to low and declining usage, we have made the decision to deprecate the Enhanced Analytics product the week of May 25, 2025.
We recommend considering our Data Connect product as a replacement. Data Connect allows you to build similar customizable visualizations using your preferred business intelligence tools.
For more information about this deprecation, see the [Enhanced Analytics deprecation guide](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/announcements/enhanced-analytics-deprecation.md).
