# Second Quarter 2025 Reporting enhancements

This page describes all reporting and dashboard enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q2-release-activity/25-q2-release-overview.md).

## Document approval and decision data now available in Data Connect

You can now access data for document approvals and decisions in Data Connect. This data set bridges document approvals from Workfront proofing capabilities and Frame.io approvals that are happening on Workfront documents. You will now be able to illustrate cycle time, number of cycles, and timeline impacts for late approvals through your BI visualizations.

## Look-and-feel updates to the Workfront Calendar

>Preview release: February 27, 2025; Production release for all customers: With the 25.4 release (April 10, 2025)

We have updated the look and feel of the Workfront Calendar to a modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. There are small functionality differences from the current Workfront Calendar including:

* How you add ad-hoc items to the calendar
* How you create and rename the calendar
* The calendar actions have moved to a More menu next to the calendar name
* A new side panel for viewing calendar information
* You can no longer hide weekends
* And more

For more information, see the [Calendars](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/calendars.md) articles.
