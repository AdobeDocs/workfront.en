# Look-and-feel updates during the Second Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the Second Quarter 2025 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the Second Quarter 2025 release, see [Second Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q2-release-activity/25-q2-release-overview.md).

## New look and feel for the Share dialog 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: January 30, 2025; Production for fast release: With the 25.2 release (February 2025); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.4 release (April 2025)

We have updated the look and feel of the Share dialog modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. There are slight visual differences including:

* The "Visible system-wide" option now displays "Everyone in the system can view". This option still functions as it did previously. 
* There is a new icon to access advanced share settings.
