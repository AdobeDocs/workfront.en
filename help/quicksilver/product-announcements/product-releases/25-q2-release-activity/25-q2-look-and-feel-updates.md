# Look-and-feel updates during the Second Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the Second Quarter 2025 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the Second Quarter 2025 release, see [Second Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q2-release-activity/25-q2-release-overview.md).

## Look-and-feel updates to the Workfront Calendar

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: February 27, 2025; Production release for all customers: With the 25.3 release (March 2025)

We have updated the look and feel of the Workfront Calendar to a modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. There are small functionality differences from the current Workfront Calendar including:

* How you add ad-hoc items to the calendar
* How you create and rename the calendar
* The calendar actions have moved to a More menu next to the calendar name
* A new side panel for viewing calendar information
* And more

For more information, see the [Calendars](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/calendars.md) articles.

## Updated view of a project milestone path in a project view

>Preview release: February 27, 2025; Production for fast release: With the 25.3 release (March 2025); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.4 release (April 2025)

When accessing the milestone path from a project list or a report, the milestone details page now has a new look and feel. You must add the Milestone Path Name field to the view of the list or report to be able to access the milestone path's details page. 

With this update we have also added information about the colors and color codes of each milestone.  

For information, see [Create a milestone path](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/configure-approval-milestone-processes/create-milestone-path.md).

## Temporary look-and-feel changes to document emails 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: February 13, 2025; Production release for all customers: February 13, 2025

Emails related to adding or sharing documents will no longer have a thumbnail image in the email body. 

Some customers will also see the legacy task and issue assignment email, which only shows the assignee's avatar.

These changes are temporary as we investigate email delays.

## New look and feel for the Share dialog 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: February 13, 2025; Production release for all customers: With the 25.3 release (March 2025)

We have updated the look and feel of the Share dialog to a modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. There are slight visual differences including:

* The "Visible system-wide" option now displays "Everyone in the system can view". This option still functions as it did previously. 
* There is a new icon to access advanced share settings.
