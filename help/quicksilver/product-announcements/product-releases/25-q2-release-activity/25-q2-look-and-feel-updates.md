# Look-and-feel updates during the Second Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the Second Quarter 2025 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the Second Quarter 2025 release, see [Second Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q2-release-activity/25-q2-release-overview.md).

## Temporary look-and-feel changes to document emails

>Preview release: February 13, 2025; Production release for all customers: February 13, 2025

Emails related to adding or sharing documents will no longer have a thumbnail image in the email body. 

Some customers will also see the legacy task and issue assignment email, which only shows the assignee's avatar.

These changes are temporary as we investigate email delays.

## New look and feel for the Share dialog

We have updated the look and feel of the Share dialog to a modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. There are slight visual differences including:

* The "Visible system-wide" option now displays "Everyone in the system can view". This option still functions as it did previously. 
* There is a new icon to access advanced share settings.
