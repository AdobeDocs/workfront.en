## Enhancements to proofs in the mobile app (iOS only)

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Apple App Store on March 12, 2025. Development for the Android app is ongoing.

Several enhancements are available for proof functionality in the Adobe Workfront mobile app:

* You can now open a proof file from your mobile email application, from a link that was shared with you. Previously, links from emails were not supported and you had to access proofs from the Workfront mobile app.
* Multimedia proof files are now supported in the mobile app.
