# Second Quarter 2025 Mobile enhancements

This page describes all Mobile enhancements made within the Second Quarter 2025 releasetime frame.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q2-release-activity/25-q2-release-overview.md).


## Enhancements to proofs in the mobile app (iOS only)

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Apple App Store on March 12, 2025. Development for the Android app is ongoing.

Several enhancements are available for proof functionality in the Adobe Workfront mobile app:

* You can now open a proof file from your mobile email application, from a link that was shared with you. Previously, links from emails were not supported and you had to access proofs from the Workfront mobile app.
* Multimedia proof files are now supported in the mobile app.


For information, see [Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md).
