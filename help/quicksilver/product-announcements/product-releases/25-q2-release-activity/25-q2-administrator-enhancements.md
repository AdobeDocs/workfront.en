# Second Quarter 2025 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the Second Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Second Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [Second Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q2-release-activity/25-q2-release-overview.md).

## Enhancements to custom forms logic



>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: March 13, 2025; Production release for all customers: With the 25.4 release (April 10, 2025)

The custom forms logic builder has an updated interface to provide you with more room for creating logic rules. This new design can more easily accommodate additional logic types that may be added in the future.

In addition to the current display and skip logic options, validation logic is now available. When this logic type is applied to a field, an error message is displayed if the field value meets the defined validation conditions. The validation can be based on the values of other fields or the status of objects.

A formula editor for validation logic allows you to build complex logic expressions.

For more information, see [Add logic rules to custom forms and fields](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/display-skip-logic-form-designer.md).
