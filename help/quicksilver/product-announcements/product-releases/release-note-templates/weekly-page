## Add tasks and issues to Workfront Boards from lists and reports

You can now add existing tasks or issues to a Workfront board directly from a list or report view. Any items you add to the board will become connected cards.

For more information, see [Add existing tasks or issues to a board](LINK). This article will not be available until I verify the feature is released to Preview and publish the article. -->
