# Other enhancements during the First Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes enhancements made with the First Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q1-release-activity/25-q1-release-overview.md).

## Update on how moved or deleted assets in linked folders are managed

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: November 21, 2024; Production release for all customers: December 5, 2024

We've changed the way moved and deleted assets are handled when using the Adobe Workfront integration with Experience Manager Assets and Assets Essentials:

* Deleted assets: When an asset is deleted inside of a linked folder in Assets or Assets Essentials, the deleted asset will be retained in the Project Documents area.
* Moved assets: When an asset is moved outside of a linked folder in Assets or Assets essentials, the moved asset will be retained in the Projects Documents area.

## Sections within a custom form are now collapsible and expandable

>Preview release: November 11, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.12 release (December 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.1 release (January 2025)

When a custom form with multiple sections is attached to an object, you can now collapse and expand all sections except the default section at the top of the form. The administrator can also see this functionality when previewing the form in the form designer.

For information about adding a section to a custom form, see [Organize and preview a form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/organize-a-form.md).

## AI Assistant can now work with projects, tasks, and issues

>Preview release: October 31, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.11 release (November 14, 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.1 release (January 2025)

To make it easier to manage your work items in Workfront, we've updated AI Assistant to work with projects, tasks, and issues. Now, AI Assistant can locate projects, tasks, and issues based on criteria you specify, such as "Find my tasks that are due this week."
Previously, AI Assistant was not able to work directly with projects, tasks, and issues.

Your Workfront administrator can enable or disable AI Assistant for your organization. The AI Assistant is available for instances with Select, Prime, and Ultimate plans.

For more information, see [Use AI Assistant to work with projects, tasks, and issues](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/work-with-pti-through-ai-assisant.md).
