To make it easier to manage your work items in Workfront, we've updated AI Assistant to work with projects, tasks, and issues. Now, AI Assistant can locate projects, tasks, and issues based on criteria you specify, such as "Find my tasks that are due this week."

Previously, AI Assistant was not able to work directly with projects, tasks, and issues.

Your Workfront administrator can enable or disable AI Assistant for your organization. The AI Assistant is available for instances with Select, Prime, and Ultimate plans.

For more information, see [Use AI Assistant to work with projects, tasks, and issues](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/ai-assistant/work-with-pti-through-ai-assisant.md).
