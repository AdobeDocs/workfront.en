# First Quarter 2025 Project enhancements

This page describes all project enhancements made with the First Quarter 2025 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2025 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q1-release-activity/25-q1-release-overview.md).

## More relevant assignments removed from Preview and Production for Fast Release environments 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: December 19, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 25.1 release (January 16, 2025) 

A functionality that has been in the Preview environment since December 2023 and in the fast release Production environment since March 2024 has now been removed. The features added more relevant smart assignment suggestions when assigning tasks.  

With this change, smart assignments now work the same way in Preview and fast release Production as they have worked in the Production environment for all customers in the following areas: 

* When adding assignments to a new task 

* When adding assignments to an existing task 

For more information, see [Smart assignments overview](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md).
