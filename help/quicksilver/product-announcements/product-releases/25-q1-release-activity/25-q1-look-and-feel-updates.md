# Look-and-feel updates during the First Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the First Quarter 2025 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the First Quarter 2025 release, see [First Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q1-release-activity/25-q1-release-overview.md).

To enhance performance, we've made visual updates to the Cloud Providers page in the Setup area. 

A small functionality change was applied to the Quip integration. Instead of inputting Client ID and Client Secret directly on the Cloud Providers page, you must click the Edit icon to make those fields visible.

## Look-and-feel update for Request access dialog

The dialog for requesting access to objects has been updated to a more modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront. This dialog is available when you request access to projects, tasks, issues, programs, portfolios, templates, and template tasks.

We have updated the Company Members and Company Billing Rates pages with a more modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront.

## Look-and-feel updates for the main and secondary navigation areas

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: November 6, 2024; Production release for all customers: November 6, 2024

We've upgraded the Workfront main navigation and secondary navigation areas to improve performance. The look-and-feel changes are minimal.

The most noticeable changes are as follows:

* The Favorites and Recents drop-down screens no longer have a close button. You can simply click away from the screen or press ESC on your keyboard to close it.
* You can no longer drag-and-drop pinned pages to arrange them. Instead, there is a drop-down menu with buttons that allow you to move your pinned pages.

>Preview release: November 4, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.12 release (December 12, 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.1 release (January 2025)

We are introducing a new list format in the Workfront Setup area, and the exchange rates list is the first page to use this table-style format. The functionality for adding new exchange rates and searching for exchange rates has not changed.
