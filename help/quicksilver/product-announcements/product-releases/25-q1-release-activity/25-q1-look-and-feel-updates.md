# Look-and-feel updates during the First Quarter 2025 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the First Quarter 2025 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the First Quarter 2025 release, see [First Quarter 2025 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/25-q1-release-activity/25-q1-release-overview.md).

## Look-and-feel updates to the Workfront navigation bar

>[!NOTE]
>
>Production release for all customers: Before the 24.11 release (November 14, 2024)

We've upgraded the Workfront navigation bar to improve its performance. The look-and-feel changes are minimal.

The most noticeable changes are as follows:

* The Favorites and Recents drop-down screens no longer have a close button. You can simply click away from the screen or press ESC on your keyboard to close it.
* You can no longer drag-and-drop pinned pages to arrange them. Instead, there is a drop-down menu with buttons that allow you to move your pinned pages.

## Look-and-feel update for Send update to user window

>Preview release: October 24, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.11 release (November 14, 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.1 release (January 2024)

The Send update to user window has been updated to a more modern design that is consistent with other areas of Workfront.

Users with a Standard, Plan, or Work license can use this feature by going to the User list, selecting one or more users, and clicking **Send Update to User**.
