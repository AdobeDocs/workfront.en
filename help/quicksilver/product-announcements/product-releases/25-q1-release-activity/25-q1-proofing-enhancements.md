We are introducing a new browser extension, the Adobe Workfront review tool, to replace the legacy browser extension for reviewing interactive ZIP content. The legacy browser extension will be removed on February 28, 2025.

The new Adobe Workfront review tool supports reviewing ZIP content across all common browsers. In addition to ZIP content, the new extension will also support reviewing URL content and is currently in beta.

To install the new extension, see the [Install the extension](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/review-proof-in-web-viewer-extension.md#install-the-extension) section in [Review interactive content with the Adobe Workfront review tool](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/review-proof-in-web-viewer-extension.md).
