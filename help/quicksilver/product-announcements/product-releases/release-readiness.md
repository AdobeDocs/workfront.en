# Release readiness

Workfront releases major updates quarterly. As a Workfront administrator, you have the opportunity to ensure that your organization has a smooth transition to each new version of the Workfront product. 

## Understand the Workfront release process

For a detailed description of the Workfront release process, see [Adobe Workfront release schedule and process](workfront-release-schedule.md)

## Prepare for a Workfront quarterly release

We recommend that you consider some or all of the following actions that can help you prepare your organization for upcoming releases.

<!--Add TOC-->

### Stay up to date with release notes

Release notes for a given feature are published when the feature goes to the Preview Sandbox environment. That way, you can know about and explore the feature before it is part of the day-to-day Production environment.

Each quarterly release has a quarterly release overview with brief descriptions of each feature and links to more in-depth notes that contain more information as well as demo videos. These in-depth notes are organized by week as the releases to preview occur, and then are reorganized by area closer to the actual production release date. 

We highly recommend watching the demo videos available in the release notes. These can be particularly useful to see the feature in action, or for a quick look into the context of the feature if you're short on time.

For links to the quarterly release overviews, see [Product releases](product-releases.md)

### Watch the Workfront Announcement Center

Workfront will inform you through the Annoucement Center of the timing of various aspects of the release:

* All new features are available in the Preview environment
* All new features are available in the Production environment
* The release webinar
* Off-cycle releases (releases to production outside of the quarterly release cycle)

>[!TIP]
>
>* Make sure you receive information about new releases by deselecting "New releases" in your announcement center settings. 
>
>   For more information, see [Unsubscribe from Announcement Center Messages](../announcements/unsubscribe-from-ac-messages.md).
>
>* Announcement Center messages directly from Workfront are available only to Workfront administrators.

### Explore the Preview Sandbox Environment

The Preview Sandbox serves as an environment where users in your organization can safely test and work with data from the production environment without affecting the production environment. Since new features and functionality are released to the Preview environment well before they are released to the day-to-day Production environment, you have the opportunity to familiarize yourself with these features before they are released into the day-to-day workflows of your users. Then, if your users have any difficulty taking advantage of the new features, you will be able to more easily help them adapt. 

When a feature is released to the Preview Sandbox Environment, Workfront documentation is updated to include the new functionality. You can search for the applicable article, or follow links to the documentation from the release notes.

For more information on the Preview Sandbox Environment, see [The [!DNL Adobe Workfront] Preview Sandbox Environment](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/wf-preview-sandbox-environment.md).

### Attend the release webinar

Workfront hosts a Release Webinar shortly before each quarterly release. Here, the Workfront product team explains and demonstrates new features and functionality, and can answer questions from those attending.

Release webinars are announced through the Workfront Announcement Center.

Release notes
announcement center (admins only)
demo videos (Csll out specifically to take advantage especially if time is short)
Release webinar (announcement center and community and where else? marketing email separate from AC?)
preview - if you like earlier access to features of interest, you may consider beta or alpha programs

## Offer feedback to Workfront

As you explore and test new features

## Communicate release information to your users

You can communicate changes to your users directly. You are in the best position to determine the information that is most useful to your users, and the most effective way to communicate that information. You may consider communication channels such as:

* Internal newsletters 
* Email
* Announcement Center messages (forwarded from Workfront or created by you)
* Announcements on collaboration tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams
* Internal webinars or training videos

You can choose the balance between Workfront resources (such as documentation, release notes, and training) with information that is more tailored to the needs and workflows of your organization. Showing users how new features can improve their work or save time and energy will help your users embrace the changes, but you don't need to create demos or documentation already available through Workfront.

Over time, you will recognize the communication that is most effective for your organization. We recommend documenting your processes, assessing success, and refining your communication for the next release.
