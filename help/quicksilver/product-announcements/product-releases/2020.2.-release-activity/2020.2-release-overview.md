### Resource Management enhancements:&nbsp;The Workload Balancer

People are a Tier 1 asset. With the Workload Balancer, you can protect them from burnout and empower them to do their best work, while aligning them to key company strategies.

Introducing a reimagined scheduling experience that allows you to visualize and manage people’s workloads and demand in the same view. The user interface provides clear visual mapping of over and underutilization and is transparent to all stakeholders. People managers can use that information as an input and from the same screen rebalance the effort through the timeline, which is then reflected in the rest of the Workfront platform.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Workload Balancer began releasing as a beta with the 2019.4 release. All Workload Balancer enhancements are generally available with the 2020.2 release. The following enhancements were added with the 2020.2 release. For an overview of the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md).

  </tr> A more convenient way to update allocations in the Workload Balancer To make it more convenient to manage a user's allocations to a work item in the Workload Balancer, you can now double-click the work item. You can also still use the existing Edit allocations menu option. In addition, you are no longer required to enable displaying allocations to be able to update them.

Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic Update Task Planned Hours in the Workload Balancer A new option in the Resource Management area of the access level now allows users with this access to edit Planned Hours from the Workload Balancer. When you adjust allocations in the Workload Balancer, the total of daily allocations does not need to match the number of Planned Hours of the tasks. Once you save your allocations, the total of the allocation hours will become the Planned Hours of the task. This is only possible for tasks that have a Simple Duration Type.

You can then edit the saved version to make small changes to it instead of starting from scratch with a new filter. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 10, 2020 Production release: With the 2020.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic Show remaining hours in the Workload Balancer To help you make correct assignment decisions, a new setting now allows you to view the difference of hours between the hours a user is available to work according to their schedule and the hours that they have already been allocated to work (the remaining hours). The new setting is now available in the Workload Balancer. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 10, 2020 Production release: With the 2020.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic Show daily Planned Hours for tasks and projects in the Unassigned Work area of the Workload Balancer To help you understand how tasks will affect the workload of your users before you assign them, the "Show allocations" setting is now managing what information displays in the Unassigned Work area of the Workload Balancer. When this setting is enabled, Planned Hours for both tasks and projects display in the Unassigned Work area of the Workload Balancer. Prior to this change, this setting was updating only information in the Assigned Work area of the Balancer.

Prior to this enhancement, the Workload Balancer always displayed information starting with the current week. Beta Preview release: April 10, 2020 Production release: With the 2020.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience (Previously available) Adobe Workfront Classic Removing the “beta” label from the Workload Balancer With the 2020.2 release, the Workload Balancer will no longer in a beta state and you will be able to use the Resource Balancer to review and manage your resource assignments and allocations.
