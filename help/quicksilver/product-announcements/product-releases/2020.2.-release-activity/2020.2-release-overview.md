### Resource Management enhancements:&nbsp;The Workload Balancer {#resource-management-enhancements-the-workload-balancer}

People are a Tier 1 asset. With the Workload Balancer, you can protect them from burnout and empower them to do their best work, while aligning them to key company strategies.

Introducing a reimagined scheduling experience that allows you to visualize and manage people's workloads and demand in the same view. The user interface provides clear visual mapping of over and underutilization and is transparent to all stakeholders. People managers can use that information as an input and from the same screen rebalance the effort through the timeline, which is then reflected in the rest of the Workfront platform.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Workload Balancer began releasing as a beta with the 2019.4 release. All Workload Balancer enhancements are generally available with the 2020.2 release. The following enhancements were added with the 2020.2 release. For an overview of the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md).
