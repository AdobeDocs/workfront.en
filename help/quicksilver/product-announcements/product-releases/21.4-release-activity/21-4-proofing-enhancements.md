# 21.4 Proofing enhancements

This page describes all Proofing enhancements made with the 21.4 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of October 4, 2021.

For a list of all changes available with the 21.4 release, see [21.4 Release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/21.4-release-activity/21.4-release-overview.md).

## Improved proofing capabilities for reviewers and requestors

>[!NOTE]
>
>Released to EMEA customers only. Functionality coming to US customers soon.

To provide a more integrated experience between Workfront and Proof, we've made several improvements regarding proofing capabilities for Reviewers and Requestors:

* You can grant Moderator or Author roles to any user in Workfront, regardless of whether they have a Proofing license, giving them additional rights, like applying actions or resolving comments.
* You can add Reviewers and Requestors to proofs that require a login or that need to be electronically signed.
* All users also benefit from improved connectivity between Workfront and Proof. Now, when deactivating a user or updating a user's email address, your updates are correctly reflected in proofing when changed in Workfront.

For more information, see [Proof Roles overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/proof-roles.md).
