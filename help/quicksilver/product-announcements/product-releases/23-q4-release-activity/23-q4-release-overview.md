# Fourth Quarter 2023 release overview

This page provides information about functionality that is included in the Fourth Quarter 2023 release. These enhancements will be included in the following releases:

>|Monthly release|Quarterly release|
>|----|----|
>|<ul><li>23.8 (August 31, 2023)</li><li>23.9 (September 28, 2023)</li><li>23.10 (October 26, 2023)</li></ul>| <ul><li>23.10 (Week of October 26, 2023)</li></ul>|

The 23.10 release webinar will be held on October 5, 2023. You can [register for the webinar here](https://webinars.on24.com/adobe_workfront/whatsnewin2310?partnerref=releasenotes).

<span class="preview">Off-cycle features (those releasing to Production prior to the Fourth Quarter 2023 release date) are highlighted in yellow.</span>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The 23.3 release included the option to move your organization to monthly releases. Therefore, Workfront is changing the numbering scheme of releases to account for both monthly and quarterly release tracks.
>
>* If you are on the **fast release (monthly)** track, the release after 23.3 is **23.8**, on August 31, 2023. 
> * If you are on the **quarterly** release track, the release after 23.3 is **23.10**, in the week of October 26, 2023.
> 
> Quarterly releases will include functionality from three monthly releases. For example, the 23.10 quarterly release will include functionality released in the 23.8, 23.9, and 23.10 monthly releases.
>
>Monthly and quarterly releases are planned to be available on the last Thursday of the month.
>

#### Deprecation of the Proof mobile app with 23.10

We will be officially deprecating the Proof mobile app with the 23.10 release. The general Workfront mobile app has been enhanced with new proofing functionality (see the release note under Workfront Mobile enhancements for more information), and users are advised to begin using it for proofing work as soon as possible.

Note that the Workfront mobile app requires a Workfront login. External users and guests can continue to use the Proof app for proofing work; however, it is no longer supported and will become unavailable with 23.10.
