# Fourth Quarter 2023 Other enhancements

This page describes all other enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2023 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.10 release.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2023 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2023 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23-q4-release-activity/23-q4-release-overview.md).

## Updated email templates

As the start of a new initiative to update our event notification emails, we have updated two of the most commonly used: document approval and object sharing. These new templates have a modern design that is easier for your email recipients to parse, which make it more likely you'll get the response you need.

For more information on email templates in Workfront, see [Event notifications available in Adobe Workfront](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/event-notifications-available-in-wf.md).

## Contributor main menu changes

To better inform contributors of the features available with a paid Workfront license type, they can now see all of the options available in the main menu. Options unavailable to contributors are grayed out.
