## Automatically publish assets in Adobe Experience Manager 

We've added another workflow to the Adobe Experience Manager integration. Now, you can set your assets to automatically publish when sent to Adobe Experience Manager. The integration can be configured to publish to the Adobe Experience Manager publish service, or to an Adobe Experience Manager brand portal.

The Automatic Publish workflow can be enabled and configured in the Adobe Experience Manager integration. When enabled, the workflow can be edited on the project template or project level.

For more information, see [Publishing assets](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/use-aem-workflows.md#publishing-assets) in [Use workflows in the Experience Manager Assets integration](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/use-aem-workflows.md).

## View board cards as a list

Adobe Workfront Boards now offers the capability to view a board's cards in a list view. The list allows you to take bulk actions on cards, such as moving a group of cards to a specific column, bulk deleting cards, or editing the same field on multiple cards. Any changes you make to cards on the list view also display in the board view.

For more information, see [Use the list view of a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/list-view-of-board.md).
