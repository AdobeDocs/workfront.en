# Fourth Quarter 2023 Integration enhancements

This page describes all integration enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2023 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment with the 23.10 release.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2023 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2023 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23-q4-release-activity/23-q4-release-overview.md).

## Enhancements to experience when sending documents to SharePoint (GraphAPI)

We've made some changes to the way you send documents to your SharePoint (GraphAPI) folders

* You can use the new search box to more easily locate the folder or site you want to sent the document to.
* The Send to window now displays up to 500 sites, folders, and documents.
* Search results now display different icons for SharePoint sites and folders, making it clear which results are sites and which are folders. Files do not display an icon.

For more information, see [Link documents through the new SharePoint integration](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-sharepoint-integration.md#link-documents-through-the-new-sharepoint-integration).

## Upgrades to drag-and-drop for document integrations

We've made some enhancements to the user experience when dragging and dropping a file into a linked folder.

* For better transparency into the process, we've added a "Moving" indicator that displays while the file is in the process of moving to the linked folder.
* Now, users cannot interact with the file while it is moving. This prevents users from deleting or editing a file that has already begun to move to the linked folder, since the moving file will not contain the changes.

These changes affect all document integrations, including Adobe Experience Manager and SharePoint.

For more information, see [Move a document to a linked folder in Experience Manager Assets](/help/quicksilver/documents/adobe-workfront-for-experience-manager-assets-essentials/send-to-aem.md#move-a-document-to-a-linked-folder-in-experience-manager-assets).
