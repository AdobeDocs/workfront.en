## Updated design when adding a new issue to a project 

This update has been announced with the 23.3 release.  

We have updated the New Issue box which displays when submitting a new issue to a project. Now, the interface matches the New request box which displays when submitting a new request to a request queue.  

For more information, see [Create issues](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/issues/manage-issues/create-issues.md).
