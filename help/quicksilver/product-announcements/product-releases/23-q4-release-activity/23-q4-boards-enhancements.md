# Fourth Quarter 2023 Boards enhancements

This page describes all Boards enhancements made with the Fourth Quarter 2023 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment with the 23.10 release.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Fourth Quarter 2023 release cycle, see [Fourth Quarter 2023 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23-q4-release-activity/23-q4-release-overview.md).

For details on how to opt in to new Boards features before the quarterly release, see [Early feature opt-in for Adobe Workfront Boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/boards-early-feature-opt-in.md).

## Subtasks now available on Adobe Workfront Boards

When you add a connected card to a board for a Workfront task, any existing subtasks are imported onto the card. Also, when you create a subtask on a connected card, a subtask is added to the Workfront task.

Using subtasks on cards allows you to create a hierarchy of work.

At this time, subtasks are not visible on the board as separate cards, and subtasks are not available on issues.

For more information, see [Manage subtasks on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/manage-subtasks-on-boards.md).

## Add documents on connected cards

You can now attach documents on connected cards on Adobe Workfront Boards. Any documents you add on the card become available on the Documents tab of the connected task or issue, and the same file types are supported in both areas.

At this time, you can't delete documents from the card, but you can delete a document from the Documents tab on the task or issue.

For more information, see [Add documents on cards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/add-documents-on-cards.md).

## Enhancements to user assignments on boards and cards

The following enhancements are now available when adding users to boards and cards in Adobe Workfront Boards:

* You can now add any Workfront users as assignees to a card, not only users who are members on the board.
* Adding a user as an assignee on a card no longer automatically adds that user as a board member.
* Removing a user from a board no longer removes that user from all card assignments for the board.

For more information, see [Add or remove members from a board](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/add-members-to-board.md).

## Documents available on connected cards as view-only

For connected cards on Adobe Workfront Boards, you can now view documents such as images and PDFs. You can either preview a document in the browser or download it to your computer.

At this time, a document must be uploaded to the Workfront task for it to be available on the connected card.

For more information, see [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).

## Board view of a project now available for issues

You can now access a Board view of a project issue list. The Kanban board can help you track the progress of the issues in a more visual way than viewing them in the list.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Board view exists only on a single project because it is an alternative view of the project, and you can't access it from other areas of Workfront such as the Boards dashboard.

For more information, see [Manage a project in the Agile View](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/manage-projects/manage-projects-in-agile-view.md).
