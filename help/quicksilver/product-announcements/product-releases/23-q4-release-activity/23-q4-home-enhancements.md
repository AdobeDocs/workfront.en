## Changes to work tracking in New Home

Based on user feedback, we have removed the page-wide time range filter and summary bar that tallied tasks due and completed. Project, Task, and Issue widgets each have built-in filtering features allowing you to customize their scope on an individual basis. Additionally, these widgets will now only include content that is currently active based on status, ensuring the work they track is always relevant. We've also limited which widgets display item-count bubbles to those where it is most useful: My Work, Mentions, Awaiting My Approval, and To-dos.

For more information on tracking work in New Home, see [Get started with New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## New quick access buttons for the Project, Task, and Issue tracking widgets

Further expanding  your ability to manage work directly from New Home, new quick access buttons have been added to the Project, Task, and Issue tracking widgets (including My Work). Found on each project, task, issue, or request in these widgets, these new buttons allow you to quickly open the summary pane, upload files, edit custom forms, create an update, and log time without leaving your New Home pageâ€”as well as a larger Work On It button.

For more information on the widget capabilities in New Home, see [Get started with New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## New filter options for New Home

New filter options are now available for the My Work widget in New Home. Options include filters for object types (tasks, issues, and requests) and statuses (not ready, ready to start, working on, and completed).

For more information on filtering content in New Home, see [Get started with New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## Custom terminology support for New Home

To better meet the unique needs of organizations, New Home now utilizes custom terminology for objects as defined in an instance's layout templates. For example, if "Project" objects have been relabeled as "Campaigns" in your Workfront instance, the My Projects widget will instead display as My Campaigns in New Home.

For more information on the the content available in New Home, see [Get started with New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## Change to New Home default widget set

The To-dos widget, which requires permission to create tasks, is now only present in the default widget set for users with the Standard, Plan, or Work license types. Additionally, the widget has been automatically removed from the Home pages of users with all other license types.

For more information on the widgets available in New Home, see [Get started with New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## Try New Home button removed for accounts that have disabled New Home

The Try New Home button is no longer present for accounts where New Home has been disabled. New Home must be re-enabled by the system administrator before individual users can use the button to try New Home.

For more information on enabling or disabling New Home, see [Get started with New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).
