## Fusion Devtool available for Fusion in the Adobe Unified Shell

The Fusion Devtool is now available in the Adobe Unified Shell environment. Previously, the Devtool could not be accessed in the Adobe Unified Shell.

Currently, only the Live Stream area of the Devtool is available in the Unified Shell.

## Update to connection for Adobe Campaign Classic connector

Adobe Campaign has updated their API to accept only server-to-server connections. We have updated the Adobe Campaign Classic Connector to allow the creation of server-to-server connections. 

If you are connecting to Campaign version 8 or higher, you **must** create a server-to-server connection. 

For more information on creating a connection in the Adobe Campaign Classic connector, see [Connect [!DNL Adobe Campaign Classic] to [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion]](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/adobe-campaign-classic-connector.md#connect-adobe-campaign-classic-to-adobe-workfront-fusion) in the article [Adobe Campaign Classic modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/adobe-campaign-classic-connector.md).
