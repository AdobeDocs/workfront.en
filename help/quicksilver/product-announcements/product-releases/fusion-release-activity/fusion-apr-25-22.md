## Adobe Workfront Proof connector now available for users with a Workfront Fusion for Automation license

Because Workfront Proof is so closely integrated with Workfront, and a major component of many Workfront workflows, we're making the Workfront Proof connector available to organizations with a Workfront Fusion for Work Automation license. Now, you can use Workfront Proof in your Fusion scenarios regardless of license.

Previously, the Workfront Proof connector was only available to organization with a Workfront Fusion for Work Automation and Integration license.

For more information, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion licenses](../../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md).
