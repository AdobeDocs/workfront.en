# Workfront Fusion release activity:&nbsp;Week of September 21, 2020

This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of September 21, 2020.

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](../../../../../product-announcements/product-releases/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## Select input fields when using the Workfront > Update Record or Workfront > Create Record modules

To help you use your Workfront scenarios more easily, we've introduced a new type of field. The "Select fields to map" field allows you to choose which fields you want to have available to modify on a given object. This makes it easier for you to enter information or troubleshoot, since you don't have to scroll through as many fields. Limiting the available fields also prevents problems that were occasionally encountered when objects with many custom fields could become too big to run efficiently.

For more information, see [Adobe Workfront modules](../../../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md).

## Updates to Workfront > Watch Fields module

To make it easier to set up the Workfront > Watch fields module, we've updated the module to only display fields that have actually been setup for tracking in your Workfront instance. Your Workfront administrator configures which object fields and actions Workfront tracks.

We have also included a fix that ensures that you can use mapped fields from the object without first running the scenario once.

For more information, see [Adobe Workfront modules](../../../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md).
