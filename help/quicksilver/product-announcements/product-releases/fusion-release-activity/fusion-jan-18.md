## Debug scenarios with the Workfront Fusion DevTool

To make it easier for you to debug your scenarios, we've created a Workfront Fusion 2.0 DevTool Chrome extension. With this extension, you can check manual runs of your scenario, review all performed operations, and see details of every API call. The DevTool also features tools that let you modify your scenario without having to modify modules or filters one by one.
