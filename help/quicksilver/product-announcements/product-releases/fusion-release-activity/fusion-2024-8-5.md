## Adobe Photoshop modules can now output to Fusion internal storage for later use in the scenario

We've added Fusion internal storage to the output storage options in many of the Adobe Photoshop modules. Fusion internal storage allows you to use the file later in the scenario, but does not make the file available outside of the scenario. When using Fusion internal storage, you do not need to specify the output file location.

Previously, these modules output only to external storage providers.

For information on the Adobe Photoshop modules, see [Adobe Photoshop modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/adobe-photoshop-modules.md).
