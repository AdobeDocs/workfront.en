# Workfront Fusion release activity: Week of October 17, 2022

## Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries > Upload assets module now allows larger files

Because assets in your Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries are often detailed and complex, and therefore can be large files, we've made it possible for you to upload larger files to your Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries. You can now use the Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries > Upload assets module to upload files as large as 1 GB to your Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries.

Previously, file uploads in this module were limited to 5MB.

For more information on the Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries modules, see [Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries Modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/creative-cloud-libraries-modules.md).

For information on other Workfront Fusion performance guardrails, including file size limits, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion performance guardrails](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/get-started/fusion-performance-guardrails.md).
