# Workfront Fusion release activity: Week of November 27, 2023

This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of November 27, 2023

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## Debugging tools now available in the Adobe Unified Experience

We've made the Tools area available as part of the Fusion Devtool in the Adobe Unified Experience. Now, users that access Fusion through Adobe can use the Tools area of the Devtool to perform actions such as:

* Retrieving app metadata
* Copying filter settings
* Replace a connection in every module for a given connector
* Highlight modules for a given app in the scenario
* Swap a variable for a new value
* And more

Previously, the Devtool Tools area was available only to users in the classic Fusion experience.

For information and instruction on available tools, see [Scenario Debugger](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/scenarios/debug-scenarios-with-dev-tool.md#tools).

## Adobe Experience Manager Forms module now available

With the new Adobe Experience Manager Forms > Watch for form events module, you can trigger a scenario when a Submit action occurs on an Adobe Experience Manager Form.

The Watch for form events module is currently the only module available in the Adobe Experience Manager Forms connector, and requires some configuration in Adobe Experience Manager Forms.

For more information and instructions, see [Adobe Experience Manager Forms module](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/aem-forms-modules.md).
