## Update to Workfront Fusion Slack connector

We've added more modules to the Slack connector in Workfront Fusion. Now you can use dedicated modules to:

* Trigger a scenario when you receive a multiparty direct message, when a file is added to a channel, or when a user is added to your workspace.
* Search for messages
* Create, read, upload, download, or delete files attached to messages.
* Add stars to or remove stars from channels
* Retrieve information about a user, or remove a user from a channel
* Create, read, complete, or delete reminders
* Set a user's status
* Perform a custom API call

All of the existing modules are still available.

For more information, see [Slack modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/slack-modules.md).
