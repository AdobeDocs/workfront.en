<h2>Filter and sort Workfront Fusion scenario execution history</h2>
<p>To make it easier to find specific scenario executions, we've made it possible to filter by more fields in the scenario execution history. Now, in addition to existing filters, you can filter by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>Execution duration</p> </li>
<li> <p>Number of operations</p> </li>
<li> <p>Amount of data transferred</p> </li>
<li> <p>Action type (run or update)</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, execution history could be filtered only by start time or status.</p>
<p>You can also now sort the scenario execution history. You can sort by the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>Execution start time</p> </li>
<li> <p>Execution status</p> </li>
<li> <p>Execution duration</p> </li>
<li> <p>Number of operations</p> </li>
<li> <p>Amount of data transferred</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on filtering and sorting execution history, see <a href="../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-scenario-execution-history.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View a scenario's execution history in Adobe Workfront Fusion</a>.</p>

## New functions available in mapping panel

Two new functions are now available in the mapping panel.

* New date and time function: dateDifference

  To make it easier to calculate spans of time in your scenarios, we've added the new "dateDifference" date and time function. This function takes two dates or times and a unit of time, and returns the amount of time between the dates or times, expressed in the chosen unit of time.

  Previously, date and time difference could be calculated only by a formula entered by the user.

  For more information, see [Date and time functions in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/functions/date-and-time-functions.md).

* New array function: arrayDifference

  This function takes two arrays, and returns a new array. You can select the type of new array that the module returns:

   * An array of elements of one array that aren't contained in the other
   * An array of elements that are contained in one array or the other, but not both.

  For more information, see [Array functions in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/functions/array-functions.md).
