## New filter operators available in Workfront > Watch events module

To make it easier for you to start a scenario based on events that are important to your workflow, we've added new operators to the filter in the Workfront > Watch events module.

* Greater than or equal to
* Less than or equal to
* Contains
* Exists
* Does not exist
* Changed

Note that the `Changed` operator ignores the State field, and that the `Exists`, `Does not Exist`, and `Changed` operators do not require a field value.

For more information, see [Watch events](help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md#watch-events) in the [Workfront modules](help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md) article.
