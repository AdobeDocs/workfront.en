## Connect using OAuth2 PKCE in the Workfront Fusion Frame.io connector

Now, when creating a connection in a Frame.io module, you can select the option to create a connection using OAuth2 PKCE, a secure, industry standard authentication method. The existing API token connection type is still available for the Frame.io connector.

Previously, only the API token connection method was available for the Frame.io connector.

For more information, see [Frame.io modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/frame-io-modules.md).
