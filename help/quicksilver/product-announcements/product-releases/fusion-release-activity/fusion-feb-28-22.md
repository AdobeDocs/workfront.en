## Select API version in Azure DevOps > Custom API call module

To allow you more control over your API calls in Workfront Fusion's Azure DevOps connector, we've added the ability to select the Azure DevOps API version in the Custom API Call module. Workfront Fusion supports Azure DevOps API versions 4.1 through 7.1.

Previously, you could not select the API version.
