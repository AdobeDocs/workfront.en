# Workfront Fusion release activity: Week of September 26, 2022

## GitLab connector and modules now available

Now you can use Adobe Workfront Fusion to connect to your GitLab account. With the GitLab modules, you can perform a wide variety of actions, such as the following:

* Trigger a scenario when there are changes in a GitLab object such as a commit, issue, merge request, project, pipeline, or repository
* Create a GitLab object such as a commit, label, pipeline, release, merge request, or note
* Retrieve information about Gitlab objects
* Retry builds or failed pipeline jobs
* Edit, modify, or update GitLab objects

For more information, including a complete list of available actions, see [GitLab modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/gitlab-modules.md).
