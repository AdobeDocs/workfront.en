## Large file processing now available for more connectors

We've updated more connectors in Workfront Fusion to allow processing of files up to 15 GB in size. 

Large file processing is available for the following additional connectors:

* Workfront Proof > Upload File
* Adobe Authenticator > Make a Custom API Call

To use large files in existing scenarios, replace modules that handle files with the newly available modules.

Large file capability is available only to Workfront Ultimate customers, and is a phased rollout. All Fusion organizations with a Workfront Ultimate plan will have large file capability by January 2025.

For more information on large files in Workfront Fusion, see [Working with large files in Adobe Workfront Fusion](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/get-started/fusion-large-files.md).
