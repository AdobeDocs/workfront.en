## Updates to event subscription process in Workfront > Watch Events module

To ensure that scenarios account for duplication in scenario triggers, engineers from Workfront and Workfront Fusion collaborated to refine the process in which event subscriptions in Workfront send events to Fusion. This improves data quality by reducing the possibility of data issues based on scenarios working with duplicate data.

For more information on event subscriptions in the Workfront > Watch Events module, see [Event subscription filters in the [!DNL Workfront] > [!UICONTROL Watch Events] modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md#event-subscription-filters-in-the-workfront--watch-events-modules)
