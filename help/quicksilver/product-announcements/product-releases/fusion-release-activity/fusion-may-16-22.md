## "Run an action" module now available for the Anaplan connector in Workfront Fusion

To simplify the Workfront Anaplan connector, we've created the Run an action module. This module contains the functionality of the Import data and Export data modules. You can also use this module to delete an Anaplan action or run an Anaplan process.
Previously, importing and exporting data was controlled through separate modules, and deleting actions and running processes were not available.

For more information, see [Anaplan Modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/anaplan-modules.md).
