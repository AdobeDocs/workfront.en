## Adobe PDF Services now available in Workfront Fusion

Now you can use Adobe Workfront Fusion to create and modify PDFs. Because Workfront Fusion is part of the Adobe product suite, you don't need a separate Adobe account to use these modules.

With the Adobe PDF tools modules, you can:

* Generate a PDF from data you provide
* Extract data from a PDF
* Create a PDF from an image, document, or HTML file
* Convert a PDF to an image or document
* Combine PDF files into one larger PDF file
* Secure a PDF file with a password, or remove password protection from a PDF
* Compress PDF files to use less memory or bandwidth
* Linearize a PDF file so that it can be read page-by-page before the entire file is downloaded
* Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on a file
* Modify a PDF by deleting or rotating certain pages
* Get PDF file properties such as page count, version, or encryption
