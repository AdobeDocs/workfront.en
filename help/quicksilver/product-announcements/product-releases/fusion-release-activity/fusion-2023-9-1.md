## Connection Metadata now available in Workfront Fusion

Until now Fusion users relied on labeling to distinguish production and nonproduction connections, or to identify which connections are service accounts and which are personal. Now, Fusion connections have attributes for these metadata. Fusion designers are now able to set these attributes when creating a new connection. Metadata can be edited from the Connections page.  

For more information, see [Connection metadata](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/connections/connection-metadata.md).
