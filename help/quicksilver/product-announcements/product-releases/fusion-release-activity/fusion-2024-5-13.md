## API module now available for Adobe PDF Services connector

To make it easier to make custom calls to the Adobe PDF Services API, we've added the Make a Custom API Call module to the Adobe PDF Service connector. Now, you can make a call to a PDF Services endpoint that is not currently represented in another PDF Services module, without using the HTTP modules.

For information and instructions, see [Make a custom API call](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/pdf-modules.md#make-a-custom-api-call) in the article PDF Services modules.
