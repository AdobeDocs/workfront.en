## Workfront modules now use Workfront API version 17

We've upgraded the Fusion Workfront modules to use the newly released version of the Workfront API, version 17. Now, Workfront modules can take advantage of the latest Workfront functionality.

The new API will be available in the Workfront connector on the following dates:

* EU: Thursday, November 13, 2023
* US: Friday, November 17, 2023

For a list of new changes to the API, see [What's new in API version 17](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/new-api-version-17.md).

For all fields available in the Workfront API, see the [API Explorer](https://developer.adobe.com/workfront/api-explorer).

## Scenario Debugger now available in the Adobe Unified Experience

We've made the Scenario Debugger available as part of the Fusion Devtool in the Adobe Unified Experience. Now, users that access Fusion through Adobe can use the Debugger to troubleshoot complex scenarios. The Debugger displays the history of the scenario runs and enables you to search modules by their name or ID.

Previously, the Scenario Debugger was available only to users in the classic Fusion experience.

For information on how to use the Scenario Debugger, see [Scenario Debugger](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/scenarios/debug-scenarios-with-dev-tool.md#scenario-debugger).
