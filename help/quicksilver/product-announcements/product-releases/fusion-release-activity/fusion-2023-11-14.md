## Scenario Debugger now available in the Adobe Unified Experience

We've made the Scenario Debugger available as part of the Fusion Devtool in the Adobe Unified Experience. Now, users that access Fusion through Adobe can use the Debugger to troubleshoot complex scenarios. The Debugger displays the history of the scenario runs and enables you to search modules by their name or ID.

Previously, the Scenario Debugger was available only to users in the classic Fusion experience.

For information on how to use the Scenario Debugger, see [Scenario Debugger](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/scenarios/debug-scenarios-with-dev-tool.md#scenario-debugger).
