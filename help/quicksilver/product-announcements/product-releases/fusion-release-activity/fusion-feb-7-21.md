## Go directly to the Scenario Editor when creating a scenario

To make the scenario creation process smoother, we've removed the app selection page. Now, you can go directly to the Scenario Editor and select the app you want to connect to from the list that appears when you add a module.

Previously, you could select apps from the app selection page as well as the list.

For more information on selecting apps for your scenario, see [Create a scenario in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/create-a-scenario.md).
