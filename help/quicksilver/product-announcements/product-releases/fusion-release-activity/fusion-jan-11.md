## Search your scenario execution history

We've made it easier for you to locate specific information from previous scenario executions. Fusion's new full text search makes it possible to search execution history for any data contained in a bundle. For example, to identify which execution created a specific task, you could use full text search to search for that Task ID.

Previously, finding specific execution information required viewing each execution individually.

For more information, see [View a scenario's execution history in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-scenario-execution-history.md).
