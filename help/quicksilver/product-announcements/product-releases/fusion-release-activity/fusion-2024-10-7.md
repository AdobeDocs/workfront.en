## Workfront > Upload Document module now uploads document in chunks

To make uploading documents from Fusion work more smoothly with Workfront, we've created a new Upload Document module. The new module uploads documents in chunks. 

The existing Upload Documents module has been renamed to "Upload Documents (Legacy)." This module still works as expected, and scenarios using the existing module do not need to be updated.

For more information on configuring this module, see [Workfront modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md#actions).
