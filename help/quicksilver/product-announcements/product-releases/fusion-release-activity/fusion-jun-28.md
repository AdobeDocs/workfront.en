# Workfront Fusion release activity:&nbsp;Week of June 28, 2021

This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of June 28, 2021.

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## New search module in Salesforce connector

To make it simpler to search Salesforce objects, we've added another search module to the Salesforce connector. Now instead of entering an SOSL or SOQL query, you can use the Search module to create a query using drop-down menus. This new search filter is similar to filter functionality in other areas of Workfront Fusion.

If you prefer to enter the queries yourself, you can use the previously existing functionality in the Search with Query module.

For more information, [Salesforce modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/salesforce-modules.md).

## Event subscription filtering available in Workfront >&nbsp;Watch records module

To go along with Workfront's new event subscription filtering functionality, we've updated the Workfront > Watch records module to enable event filtering. Now, you can set a filter when you create a webhook. This allows the scenario to trigger only when the event meets certain criteria, reducing the number of executions your scenario needs to run.

Previously, the Watch records module would retrieve all records. Users could filter only by setting up filters in later scenario modules.

For more information, see [Adobe Workfront modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md).
