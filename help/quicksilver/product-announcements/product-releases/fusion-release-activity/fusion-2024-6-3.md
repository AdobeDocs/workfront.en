## New user experience in Workfront Fusion

Workfront Fusion has been updated for users that do not access Fusion through the Adobe Experience Cloud. The new Fusion UI provides a more seamless experience with other Adobe products.

In addition, we've added a button for the Fusion Dev Tool to the toolbar. Now, you can quickly find this tool when you want to access the live stream, debugger, or scenario tools. 

For information on how the new experience differs from the legacy experience, see [Navigate the new experience in Workfront Fusion](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/get-started/new-fusion-ui.md).

For more information on the Fusion Dev Tool, see [Debug scenarios with the [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] Devtool](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/scenarios/debug-scenarios-with-dev-tool.md).
