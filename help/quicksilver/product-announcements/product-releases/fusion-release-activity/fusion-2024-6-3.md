## New user experience in Workfront Fusion

Workfront Fusion has been updated for users that do not access Fusion through the Adobe Experience Cloud. The new Fusion UI provides a more seamless experience with other Adobe products, and will smooth the transition of your users to the Adobe Experience Cloud.

Previously, the experiences of users that accessed Fusion through the Adobe Experience Cloud and those who did not were different in significant ways.

For information on how the new experience differs from the legacy experience, see [Navigate the new experience in Workfront Fusion](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/get-started/new-fusion-ui.md).

## Dev Tool now available in scenario builder toolbar

To make it easier for you to use the Workfront Fusion Dev Tools, we've added a button for the  Dev Tools to the toolbar. Now, you can quickly find these tools when you want to access the live stream, debugger, or scenario tools. 

Previously, these tools were only available by right-clicking in the scenario builder.

For more information on the Fusion Dev Tool, see [Debug scenarios with the [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] Devtool](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/scenarios/debug-scenarios-with-dev-tool.md).
