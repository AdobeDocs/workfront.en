## Choose the Workfront API version in the Workfront > Custom API Call module

In order to increase flexibility in accessing the Workfront API, we've made it possible to choose the version of the Workfront API that you want the Workfront > Custom API Call module to use. This allows you to use previously available API functionality that may still be relevant to your organization's needs.
