## Adobe Firefly connector and modules now available

Now you can use Workfront Fusion to connect to Adobe Firefly.

With the Adobe Firefly connector, you can:

* Generate an image based on a prompt you provide
* Expand or fill an image
* Make a custom call to the Firefly API

For more information, see [Adobe Firefly modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/adobe-firefly-modules.md).

## Update to SOAP module

To increase security in the SOAP module, we've disabled redirects during WDSL loading.

While this increases security, unverified redirects may now be blocked when the SOAP module runs in your scenarios.

For information about the SOAP module, see [Soap module](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/soap-module.md).
