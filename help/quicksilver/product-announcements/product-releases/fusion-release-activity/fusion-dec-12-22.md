## Fusion enhancements for future growth

We are working behind the scenes to prepare Fusion for anticipated growth in the coming year. Most of these changes will not be visible to you, but will ensure reliable and efficient performance for current and future customers.


We're currently working on:

* Moving further on using Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) for future Workfront Fusion Authentication.
* Changing the way Workfront Fusion handles unused webhooks, to prevent them from affecting performance as Fusion scales up.
* Other infrastructure enhancements.
