## Updates to Microsoft 365 Email Connector

To expand the ways you can use the Microsoft 365 Email connector, we've added some new modules:

* Search messages
* Get a message
* Delete a message
* Update a message
* List attachments
* Download an attachment
* Add an attachment
* Make an API call

We've also removed the Iterate attachments module. You can combine the List attachments module with the Iterator module to iterate attachments.
