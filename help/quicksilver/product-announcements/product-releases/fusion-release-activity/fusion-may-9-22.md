# Workfront Fusion release activity:&nbsp;Week of May 9, 2022

This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of May 9, 2022.

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.


## Enhancements to Scenario Execution History search functionality

To make it easier to locate the data you need in your Scenario Execution History, we've made the following enhancements to the Execution History Fulltext search:

* Limit the search to specific dates within the 30-day Execution History archive
* Limit the search to specific execution statuses such as Success or Error
* Copy Execution ID with a single click
* See at a glance whether a particular execution was scheduled, instant, or manually triggered
* Use your keyboard to open the search window and navigate through the results

Previously, users could search only for text, and could use filters only on the full list of executions.

For more information, see [View a scenario's execution history in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-scenario-execution-history.md).
