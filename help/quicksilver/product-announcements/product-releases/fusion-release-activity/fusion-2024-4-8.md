# Workfront Fusion release activity: Week of April 8, 2024

This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of April 8, 2024

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## JWT generator module now available

To make it easier to generate JSON web tokens within a scenario, we've added the JWT module. Here, you can generate a web token based on an algorithm you select. You can also add other options to your JWT, such as expiration date or subject.

For more information, see [JWT module](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/jwt-modules.md).

## New Search module available in Workfront connector

To improve performance of Workfront searches in Fusion, we've added a new Search module to the Workfront connector. The new module allows you to select the fields you will be using for search criteria. 

The previous search module is now labeled "Search (Legacy)." The legacy search module still functions as expected, and you do not need to update scenarios that use the legacy module.

For information on the new search module, see [Search](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md#searches) in the article Workfront modules.
