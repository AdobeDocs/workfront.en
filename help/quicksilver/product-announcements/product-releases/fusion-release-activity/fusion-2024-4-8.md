## JWT generator module now available

To make it easier to generate JSON web tokens within a scenario, we've added the JWT module. Here, you can generate a web token based on an algorithm you select. You can also add other options to your JWT, such as expiration date or subject.

For more information, see [JWT module](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/jwt-modules.md).
