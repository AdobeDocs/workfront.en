## Draft.js modules now available

To make it easier to read rich text from or add rich text to Workfront fields, we've created two Draft.js modules. Now, you can convert Draft.js to HTML, or convert HTML to draft.js. By combining these modules with Workfront modules to create, update, or read Workfront fields, you can ensure that those fields display rich text in your Workfront environment.

For more information on the Draft.js modules, see [Draft.js modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/draft-js-modules.md).
