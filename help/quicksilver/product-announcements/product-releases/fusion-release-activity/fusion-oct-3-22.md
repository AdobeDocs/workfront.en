# Workfront Fusion release activity: Week of October 3, 2022

## New operators and functionality available for event filters in Workfront > Watch Records module

To allow more flexibility and specificity when creating event filters in the Workfront > Watch Records module, we've made some updates to the Workfront > Watch Records module:

We've added some new operators to the event filter. Now, you can use any of the following:

* Equals
* Not equals
* Greater than
* Less than

We've also added the ability to select whether you want the filter to apply to the old state of the field or the new state. For example, if you have selected to watch the old state of a field and set the filter to watch for statuses that are In Progress, the module will trigger when a status changes from In Progress to a new status.
