# Workfront Fusion release activity: Week of November 7, 2022

We've made some changes to the way Workfront Fusion handles unused webhooks. Now, wWebhooks are deactivated automatically if either of the following applies:

* The webhook has not been connected to any scenario for more than 5 days.
* The webhook is used only in inactive scenarios, which have been inactive for more than 30 days.

Deactivated webhooks are deleted and unregistered automatically if they are not connected to any scenarios and have been in deactivated status for over 30 days.
