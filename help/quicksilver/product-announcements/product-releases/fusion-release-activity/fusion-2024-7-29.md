## New Adobe Journey Optimizer connector and modules now available

To allow you to integrate with Adobe Journey Optimizer, we've created a new connector. With the Adobe Journey Optimizer modules, you can:

* Create, read, update, and delete configurations, packages, content templates, or fragments
* List  configurations, content templates, or fragments
* Deploy or undeploy configurations, or check if a configuration can be deployed
* Trigger or check the status of messages
* Import packages to a sandbox
* Make a custom API call to the Adobe Journey Optimizer API

The previous Adobe Journey Optimizer connector was deprecated, because it was based on Adobe Journey Optimizer APIs that had been deprecated.

For information about the Adobe Journey Optimizer connector, see [[!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/adobe-journey-optimizer-modules.md).
