This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of February 5, 2024.

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## Adobe Authenticator module now available

The Adobe Authenticator module makes it easier to connect to any Adobe product API. Now, instead of using the HTTP modules, you can use the Adobe Authenticator module to connect to Adobe products that don't currently have a dedicated Fusion connector.

The advantage of using the Adobe Authenticator module is that you can create a connection, similar to other Fusion connectors. This connection can be used to connect to multiple Adobe APIs, eliminating the need for separate connections or HTTP module configuration for each API you connect to.

For more information, see [Adobe Authenticator module](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/adobe-authenticator-modules.md).
