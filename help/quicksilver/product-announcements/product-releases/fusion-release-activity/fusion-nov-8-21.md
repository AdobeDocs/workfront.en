## Convert a record module now available for Workfront connector

We've created a module for one of the most common actions available in the Miscellaneous actions module. Now, you can use the Convert a record module to make the following conversions:

* Issue to Task
* Issue to Project
* Task to Project

Previously, these conversions were available only through the Miscellaneous actions module.
