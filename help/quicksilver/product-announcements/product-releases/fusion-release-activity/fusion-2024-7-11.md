For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## New connection available for HubSpot connector

Fusion has a new HubSpot connection. This update addresses an issue where certain scopes required for Fusion's registration with HubSpot were unnecessary or not requested by some modules. 

Existing connections remain unaffected, and scenarios using the HubSpot connector will continue to function. Going forward, all new connections should use the new connection type named "HubSpot CRM".

## Use a shared email address in Microsoft Office 365 Email modules

To make the Microsoft Office 365 Email modules more flexible, we've added the ability to use shared email addresses. Now, a module can work with a shared address that the owner of the connection has access to.

Previously, Microsoft Email modules used only the main email address of the connection owner. 

For more information on Microsoft Email modules in Fusion, see [[!DNL Microsoft Office 365 Email] modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/microsoft-365-email-modules.md).

## Update to Adobe Authenticator module

To allow you more control over your Adobe Authenticator modules, we've made it possible for you to specify the base URLs that an Adobe Authenticator connection can connect to. This enhances security by ensuring that the connector cannot call URLs that are not on the list of accepted base URLs.

This change does not affect existing Adobe Authenticator connections. They will continue to function. 

For more information, see [Adobe Authenticator module](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/adobe-authenticator-modules.md).
