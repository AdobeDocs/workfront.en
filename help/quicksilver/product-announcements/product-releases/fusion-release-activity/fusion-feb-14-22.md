## Updates to the Workfront Fusion Anaplan connector

To expand functionality of the Anaplan connector, we've made the following updates:

* Use a dedicated module to upload a file to Anaplan. Now, you can take a file in Anaplan and upload it to additional workspaces and models.
* Retrieve Anaplan Views with the Get a Record module. Now, you can list all views of an Anaplan module or model.

For more information, see [Anaplan Modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/anaplan-modules.md).
