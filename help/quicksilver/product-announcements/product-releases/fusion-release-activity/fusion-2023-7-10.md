To allow you to get a head start on automating use cases between Marketo and Workfront, We've added three new templates to Fusion. Using these templates, you can:

* Approve your Marketo Engage email draft with Workfront approval workflows
* Review an email proof of your Marketo Engage email draft in Workfront
* Intake marketing campaign requests in Workfront and automate the creation of campaigns in Marketo Engage

You can locate these templates by clicking Templates in the left panel and searching for "Marketo."
