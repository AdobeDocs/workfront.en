## New objects available in Workfront connector modules

To make it easier for you to use the Workfront connector for your organization's use cases, we've made more objects available in some of the modules:

* The Baseline, Exchange rate, and Team objects are now available in the Create a record, Read a record, Update a record and Delete a record modules.
* The External Document object is now available in the Misc Actions module, to better support Adobe's Content Supply Chain.
* You can now copy native fields and custom forms when converting an object using the Convert an object module.

For details on any of the Workfront modules, see that module's section in the article [Workfront modules](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md).
