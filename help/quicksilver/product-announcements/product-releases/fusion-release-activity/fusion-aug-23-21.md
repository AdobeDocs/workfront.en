# Workfront Fusion release activity:&nbsp;Week of August 23, 2021

This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of August 23, 2021.

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## Typeahead fields now available in Workfront modules

To make modules easier to use, replaced some dropdown lists with typeahead fields. Now, instead of selecting items from long lists, you can begin typing the item, then click it when it appears.

Previously, users selected items from dropdown lists. Depending on the object, these lists could be long, and it could be inconvenient to scroll and locate items.

For more information on Workfront modules, see [Adobe Workfront modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md).

## Billing record object now available in Workfront modules

The Billing record object is available in drop-down object selection lists in the following modules:

* Watch Record
* Delete Record
* Create Record
* Read Record
* Update Record
* Search Record

Previously, the billing record object was only available through mapping.

For more information, see [Adobe Workfront modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md).

<h2>Filter and sort Workfront Fusion scenario execution history</h2>
<p>To make it easier to find specific scenario executions, we've made it possible to filter by more fields in the scenario execution history. Now, in addition to existing filters, you can filter by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>Execution duration</p> </li>
<li> <p>Number of operations</p> </li>
<li> <p>Amount of data transferred</p> </li>
<li> <p>Action type (run or update)</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, execution history could be filtered only by start time or status.</p>
<p>We've also made it possible to sort the scenario execution history. You can sort by the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>Execution start time</p> </li>
<li> <p>Execution status</p> </li>
<li> <p>Execution duration</p> </li>
<li> <p>Number of operations</p> </li>
<li> <p>Amount of data transferred</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on filtering and sorting execution history, see <a href="../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-scenario-execution-history.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View a scenario's execution history in Adobe Workfront Fusion</a>.</p>
