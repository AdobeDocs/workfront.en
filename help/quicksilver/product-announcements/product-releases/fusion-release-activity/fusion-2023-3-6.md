## Continuing Fusion enhancements for future growth

We are continuing to work on Fusion infrastructure to support the growth that we are seeing now and that we expect to continue throughout the year. There have not been many visible changes to your Fusion experience, but we are making changes that will ensure reliable and efficient performance for current and future customers.

We're currently working on:

* Moving further on adding Fusion to the Adobe Unified Experience.
* Updating the way Fusion stores and handles incomplete executions, to ensure that they do not affect performance as Fusion scales up.
* Updating timeout retry logic.
* Other infrastructure enhancements.
