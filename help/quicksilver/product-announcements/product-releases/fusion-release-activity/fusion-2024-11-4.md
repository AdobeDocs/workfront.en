## Large file processing now available for some connectors

We've updated Workfront Fusion to allow processing of files up to 15 GB in size. 

Large file processing is available for the following connectors:

* Workfront
* Adobe Experience Manager Assets
* HTTP

To use large files in existing scenarios, replace modules that handle files with the newly available modules.

Large file capability is available only to Workfront Ultimate customers.
