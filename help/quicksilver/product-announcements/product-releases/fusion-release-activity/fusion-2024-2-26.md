## New function available in Fusion: toArray

To make it easier to create arrays in Fusion, we've added the toArray function. This function converts a collection into an array of key-value collections. You can find this new function on the Arrays tab of the functions panel.

For details on the structure of this function, see [toArray](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/functions/array-functions.md#toarray) in the article [Array functions](/help/quicksilver/workfront-fusion/functions/array-functions.md).
