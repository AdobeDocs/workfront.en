## Changing support for Microsoft Office proofs

To maintain a robust and scalable proof processing solution, we are changing our supported Microsoft Office file types and file size limits.

The following Office file types are no longer supported as proofs:
XLT, XLTX, DOT, DOTX, POT, POTX, PPS, PPSX

Users can continue creating proofs for the following Office file types:
DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX

The PowerPoint and Word file size limit is now 512MB.
