# Adobe Workfront Proof 23.3 release activity: Week of July 17, 2023

This page describes all enhancements made with the 23.3 release for Adobe Workfront Proof to the Preview environment on July 22, 2023.

These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.3 release, unless otherwise specified.

## Postpone updates for the Desktop Proofing Viewer

Based on user feedback, we are adding the option to postpone updates for the Desktop Proofing Viewer. Users can now opt to delay an update and continue with their work, but will be reminded that an update is available each time they open the Desktop Proofing Viewer.

For more information on updating the Desktop Proofing Viewer, see [Update the Desktop Proofing Viewer](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/use-the-desktop-proofing-viewer/update-the-desktop-proofing-viewer.md).
