# Look-and-feel updates during the Third Quarter 2024 release timeframe

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the Third Quarter 2024 release timeframe.

For a list of all changes available with the Third Quarter 2024 release, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).



## Look-and-feel updates for assignment suggestions

We have updated the Assignments suggestion list to a more modern design that is consistent across all areas of Workfront. When you add an assignment to a task or issue from the header, list view, or Advanced Assignment screen, the experience is the same. The suggestions are divided into sections to help you quickly find the correct person, team, or job role for the assignment.
