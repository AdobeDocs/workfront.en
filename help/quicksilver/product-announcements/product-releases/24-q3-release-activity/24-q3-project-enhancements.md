# Third Quarter 2024 Project enhancements

This page describes all project enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).


## Edit the task and issue Commit Date and Condition from the header or Details section 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: May 30, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.6 release (June 13, 2024); Production release for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 18, 2024).

To make it easier for you to update tasks and issues, we have now added the Commit Date and Condition fields as options to add to task and issue headers and Details section in a layout template. Users are now able to update these fields from the header or Details section of a page, when they are assigned to the modified layout template. Prior to this enhancement, you could not add the Condition and the Commit Date of tasks and issues when customizing the headers.

For information about updating Commit Date and sCondition, see the following articles:

* [Update Condition for tasks and issues](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/update-condition-for-tasks-and-issues.md).
* [Update Commit Date on tasks and issues](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/update-commit-date-on-tasks-and-issues.md).

## More relevant smart assignments

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: December 21, 2023; Production for fast release: With the 24.5 release (May 16, 2024); Production release for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 18, 2024).

We have changed the algorithm that Workfront uses to calculate and suggest smart assignments for tasks. The new algorithm applies in the following areas in Workfront where you assign a task: task lists, the Assignments area in the task header, Home, and the Summary panel. 

Now, the algorithm looks at the following information when it suggests smart assignments:  

* Similarities between task, project, and portfolio names. 

* Frequency with which an assignment is made to a task with a similar name. 

If the new algorithm finds no matches, the existing criteria for calculating smart assignments are applied.  

Also consider the following: 

* The name of the smart assignments list in a task list changed in the task list from "Here are a few suggestions" to "Suggested assignments". 

* There are no changes in the way smart assignments are calculated for issues. The name of the smart assignment list in an issue list is "Here are a few recommendations".  

For more information, see [Smart assignments overview](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md).
