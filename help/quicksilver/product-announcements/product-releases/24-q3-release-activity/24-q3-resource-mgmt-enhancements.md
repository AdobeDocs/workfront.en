# Third Quarter 2024 Resource management enhancements

This page describes all resource management enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the Third Quarter 2024 release.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).

## Time off now reflected in the Workload Balancer

>[!NOTE]

>Preview release: June 6, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 18, 2024)

To seamlessly adjust work when the primary assignee on a task has scheduled time off, the Workload Balancer now re-allocates hours to both the primary and the secondary users when the project timeline is recalculated. (This feature is only available if the Workfront administrator has enabled the User Time Off setting in the Setup area to take into consideration the user's time off.)

Previously, the hours were not re-allocated when the timeline was recalculated.

For more information, see [Manage user allocations in the Workload Balancer](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/manage-user-allocations-workload-balancer.md).
