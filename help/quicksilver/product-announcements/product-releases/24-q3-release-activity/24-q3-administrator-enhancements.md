# Third Quarter 2024 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).

## Move objects between Workfront environments with environment promotion

>[!NOTE]
>
>Environment promotion will be available in sandbox, preview, and production environments with the 24.6 release (June 13, 2024).

Environment promotion allows you to move objects from one Workfront environment to another, such as from a sandbox environment to a production environment. You can configure and test objects without any risk to your organization's data and records. You can then move those objects to production without having to reconfigure them, saving time and effort.

Previously, objects would need to be configured in production environments separately from sandbox or preview environments.

More information and instructions for environment promotion will be available when environment promotion goes live with the 24.6 release.

## Share custom forms and custom fields in the custom form designer

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 6, 2024; Production release for all customers: TBD

You can now share both custom forms and custom fields within the new form designer. This allows greater collaboration between users on custom forms.

For more information, see [Share a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/share-access-to-a-custom-form.md) and [Configure sharing for custom fields and widgets with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/manage-a-form/share-custom-fields.md).

## Add a new custom field from the Fields area

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 6, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 2024)

You can now add a new custom field or widget directly from the Fields area in Workfront, without opening a custom form to create the field. This allows you to quickly create reusable custom fields.

This feature is available with both the custom form designer and the legacy custom form builder.

For more information, see [Add or edit a custom field, section break, or widget](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/edit-a-custom-field.md).

## Multi-select dropdown field type available on the form designer

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 4, 2024; Production release for all customers: June 4, 2024

To help you define dropdown fields more easily, we have added the Multi-Select Dropdown field to the custom form designer. This field type allows users to choose more than one option from a dropdown list.

You are still able to create a single-select dropdown field and change the display type to Multi-Select Dropdown.

This option is not available in the legacy form builder.

For more information, see [Design a form with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).
