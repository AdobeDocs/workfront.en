# Third Quarter 2024 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).

## Business rules are now available

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: July 4, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 18, 2024).

Administrators can now add business rules in the Setup area of Workfront.

A business rule allows you to apply validation to Workfront objects and prevent users from creating, editing, or deleting an object when certain conditions are met. The rules are built using a formula similar to calculated fields in custom forms.

For more information, see [Create and edit business rules](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/business-rules.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Business rules are only available for organizations on the new Ultimate plan.

## Custom form designer generally available in Adobe Workfront

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 19, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 18, 2024).

The custom form designer was released to beta in April of 2023 (the 23.2 release), and more features have been added to it since that time, such as External Lookup fields and Workfront native fields. In 2024 the form designer has reached functional parity with the legacy form builder.

With the 24.7 release, the form designer will be generally available and will become the default experience for creating and editing custom forms in Adobe Workfront. When you create a new custom form or open an existing form, you will see the form designer's canvas-style workspace.

After this release, you will no longer have the option to revert back to the legacy form builder.

For details about the form designer and a video demonstration, see the [form designer beta release note](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-2-admin-enhancements.md).

## Move objects between Workfront environments with environment promotion

>[!NOTE]
>
>Environment promotion will be available in sandbox, preview, and production environments with the 24.6 release (June 13, 2024).

Environment promotion allows you to move objects from one Workfront environment to another, such as from a sandbox environment to a production environment. You can configure and test objects without any risk to your organization's data and records. You can then move those objects to production without having to reconfigure them, saving time and effort.

Previously, objects would need to be configured in production environments separately from sandbox or preview environments.

For more information about environment promotion, see [Overview of moving objects between Workfront environments (Environment promotion)](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/environment-promotion-in-wf.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Environment promotion is only available for organizations on the new Prime or Ultimate plans.

## Share custom forms and custom fields in the custom form designer

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 6, 2024; Production release for all customers: June 13

You can now share both custom forms and custom fields within the new form designer. This allows greater collaboration between users on custom forms.

For more information, see [Share a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/share-access-to-a-custom-form.md) and [Configure sharing for custom fields and widgets with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/manage-a-form/share-custom-fields.md).

## Add a new custom field from the Fields area

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 6, 2024; Production release for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 18, 2024)

You can now add a new custom field or widget directly from the Fields area in Workfront, without opening a custom form to create the field. This allows you to quickly create reusable custom fields.

This feature is available with both the custom form designer and the legacy custom form builder.

For more information, see [Add or edit a custom field, section break, or widget](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/edit-a-custom-field.md).

## Multi-select dropdown field type available on the form designer

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 4, 2024; Production release for all customers: June 4, 2024

To help you define dropdown fields more easily, we have added the Multi-Select Dropdown field to the custom form designer. This field type allows users to choose more than one option from a dropdown list.

You are still able to create a single-select dropdown field and change the display type to Multi-Select Dropdown.

This option is not available in the legacy form builder.

For more information, see [Design a form with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).
