# Third Quarter 2024 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).

## Multi-select dropdown field type available on the form designer

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: April 18, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.5 release (May 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 24.7 release (July 2024)

To help you define dropdown fields more easily, we have added the Multi-Select Dropdown field to the custom form designer. This field type allows users to choose more than one option from a dropdown list.

You are still able to create a single-select dropdown field and change the display type to Multi-Select Dropdown.

For more information, see [Design a form with the form designer](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/design-a-form/design-a-form.md).
