To help you more easily view expense types, expenses have been separated into billable and non-billable expenses on projects and tasks. The following fields are available for you to add to views and reports:

* Planned Billable Expense Cost
* Planned Non-Billable Expense Cost
* Actual Non-Billable Expense Cost
* Actual Non-Billable Expense Cost

The Baseline, Template, and Project (Financial Data) reports also include the new fields. These fields are not available on the project and task details pages.

Billable expenses are marked as billable to the customer. Non-billable expenses are not marked as billable.

For more information about marking an expense as billable, see [Manage project expenses](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/projects/project-finances/manage-project-expenses.md).
