# Other enhancements during the Third Quarter 2024 release timeframe

This page describes enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).

## Improved UI experience for users with limited object access

When a user does not have access to an object, the user will see "No access" anywhere that object name displays in Workfront. This improved experience also applies to the Workfront API.

Teams and Users are not included with this change. Users are still be able to view team and user names.

For more information, see the section [Restricted access to objects](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md#restricted-access-to-objects) in the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] objects overview article.
