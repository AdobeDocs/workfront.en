# Other enhancements during the Third Quarter 2024 release timeframe

This page describes enhancements made with the Third Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment as noted.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the Third Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [Third Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q3-release-activity/24-q3-release-overview.md).

## Adobe Unified Experience now available for more Workfront organizations

>[!NOTE]
>
>* The Adobe Unified Shell is being made available in a phased rollout. Additional organizations will be onboarded to the Adobe Unified Shell with the 24.10 and 25.1 releases. 
>* Preview release: June 11, 2024; Production release for specified customers: With the 24.7 release (July 2024)

To allow organizations access to the benefits of the Adobe Unified Experience, we've begun making it available to existing Workfront customers. 

The Adobe Unified Experience includes:

* A single login for all Adobe applications through Adobe Experience Cloud
* An "organization switcher" to move between Workfront organizations and environments
* Navigation with options for Workfront pages, Adobe Experience Cloud preferences, and your Workfront profile

If your organization is moving to the Adobe Unified Experience with the 24.7 release, your Workfront administrator has received an Announcement Center message about the change.

Previously, the Adobe Unified Experience was available only to new Workfront customers.

For more information, see [Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/adobe-unified-experience.md).

## Help button removed from the main navigation bar

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: June 6, 2024; Production for all customers: With the 24.7 release (July 2024)

To unify the experience for users not on Unified Shell, the Help button on the main navigation bar has been removed. This button, which is not present for users on Unified Shell, linked to the Workfront documentation and was redundant with a similar Help button available for all users in the Main Menu.

## Improved UI experience for users with limited object access

When a user does not have access to an object, the user will see "No access" anywhere that object name displays in Workfront. This improved experience also applies to the Workfront API.

Teams and Users are not included with this change. Users are still be able to view team and user names.

For more information, see the section [Restricted access to objects](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md#restricted-access-to-objects) in the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] objects overview article.
