This page describes all other enhancements made with the 23.2 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.2 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.2 release cycle, see [23.2 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-2-release-overview.md).

## Biometric login and Boards collections in the mobile app

>[!NOTE]
>
>These features will be generally available in the Apple App Store and Google Play store the week of March 13th. General login improvements will be available in early April.


Biometric login is now an option for faster login to the mobile app! Once biometric verification has been set up after an initial login, users will be able to use fingerprint or facial recognition to quickly re-login to the app with only occasional password reverification. Additionally, there will be a number of look-and-feel improvements to the general login experience arriving in a later update.

Boards collections are also now supported in the mobile app, allowing mobile users to view any collections they have access to in the desktop version from their mobile Boards list.
