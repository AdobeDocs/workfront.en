# 23.2 Reports and Dashboards enhancements

This page describes all Reports and Dashboards enhancements made with the 23.2 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.2 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.2 release cycle, see [23.2 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-2-release-overview.md).

## Canvas Dashboards

Canvas Dashboards has been added as a work-in-progress feature for Dashboards that can be enabled in layout templates. Canvas Dashboards will allow Reporting Canvas visualizations to be combined with existing reports in addition to new layout options. Currently only list reports are supported, but more options will be added as development continues.

For more information on enabling and using Canvas Dashboards, see [Canvas Dashboards overview](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/canvas-dashboards-overview.md)
