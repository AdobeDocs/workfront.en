## Log hours on connected cards on a board

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards.

You can now log hours on connected cards, the same way you would on a task or issue. You must have the correct permissions to the task or issue to log the time.

The time logging fields are not displayed on connected cards by default. You must enable **Hours** in the Configure area under Cards.

For more information, see [Use connected cards on boards](/help/quicksilver/agile/get-started-with-boards/connected-cards.md).
