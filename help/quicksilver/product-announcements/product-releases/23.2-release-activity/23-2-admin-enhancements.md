# 23.2 Administrator enhancements

This page describes all administrator enhancements made with the 23.2 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.2 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.2 release cycle, see [23.2 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-2-release-overview.md).

## Create custom forms with the new form designer

The new form designer has a new canvas-style workspace that allows you to view the fields, canvas, and field settings all at the same time.

With the new form designer, we've added the ability to 

* **Copy a field**: You can now copy existing fields by clicking on the Copy icon on the fields directly from the canvas. 

* **Change the size for Descriptive text**: You can now assign small, medium, or large sizes to Descriptive text fields. You can also use them on the same row with other fields. 

* **Use a Default section**: If the form creator has not added a section at the top of the form, a Default section is now visible in the canvas, so that users can adjust the permissions for fields that have no custom section assigned. 

For more information, see [Form designer overview](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/form-designer/form-designer-overview.md).<!--link is to new article-->

## Rename pins in layout template

You can now rename pins in a layout template to be more meaningful to your users, instead of using the default name for the pinned page. Pins that administrators create are displayed for all users assigned to the layout template, and users can't rename those pins.

For more information, see [Customize pinned pages using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-pinned-pages.md). For details about how users can rename their personal pinned pages, see [Pin pages to customize your workspace](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/pin-pages.md).
