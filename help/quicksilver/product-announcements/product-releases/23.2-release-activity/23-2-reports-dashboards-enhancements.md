## Canvas Dashboards

Canvas Dashboards has been added as a work-in-progress feature for Dashboards that can be enabled in layout templates. Canvas Dashboards will allow Reporting Canvas visualizations to be combined with existing reports in addition to new layout options. Currently only list reports are supported, but more options will be added as development continues.

 For more information on enabling and using Canvas Dashboards, see [Canvas Dashboards overview](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/canvas-dashboards-overview.md).
