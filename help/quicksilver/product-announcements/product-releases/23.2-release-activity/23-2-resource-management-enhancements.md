## Introducing the Work Time field to accurately calculate user capacity

To allow resource managers to accurately calculate the availability of their users and account for the time users devote to actual, project-related work, we are introducing the Work Time concept to Adobe Workfront.

You can define the value of the Work Time field for every user, when you create or edit their profile. For more information, see [Edit a user's profile](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

The Work Time field represents the percentage of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) time that the user is available for actual work, not including overhead. Work Time must be a decimal number with a value between 0 and 1. For example, a 20% availability for actual work would be 0.2.

The field's default is 1, indicating that a user spends their entire FTE on actual, project-related work.

As a result of this update, Workfront calculates the user's availability using the formulas below, depending on your selection in the Resource Management preferences area:

* Default Schedule:
* User Capacity = [(Schedule Hours – Schedule Exceptions) * FTE – Time off] * Work Time
* User's Schedule:
* User Capacity = (Schedule Hours – Schedule Exceptions - Time off) * Work Time.

For more information, see [Configure [!UICONTROL Resource Management] preferences](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md).
