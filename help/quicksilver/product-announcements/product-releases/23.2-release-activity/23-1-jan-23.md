## Estimation field on connected cards maps to Story Points field on Workfront objects

>This feature is available only through the early feature opt-in for Workfront Boards.

The Estimation field on connected cards in Workfront Boards now maps to the Story Points field for the associated Workfront object. 

The new Story Points field is an editable, free form field that you can add to a view in a list or report for tasks or issues. It is not tied to planned hours or team assignments.

Previously, the card estimation was a manual entry and was not mapped to any field on a task or issue.
