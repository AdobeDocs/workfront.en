## Rename pins in layout template

You can now rename pins in a layout template to be more meaningful to your users, instead of using the default name for the pinned page. Pins that administrators create are displayed for all users assigned to the layout template, and users can't rename those pins.

For more information, see [Customize pinned pages using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-pinned-pages.md). For details about how users can rename their personal pinned pages, see [Pin pages to customize your workspace](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/the-new-workfront-experience/pin-pages.md).
