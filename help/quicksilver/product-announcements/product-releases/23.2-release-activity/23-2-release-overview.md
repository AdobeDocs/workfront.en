                        <p>You can now set a default status to apply to cards moved into a specific column, by selecting a custom status and a system status in the column policies. When you move a card into the column, Workfront first tries to apply the custom status (for example, Awaiting Feedback). If the custom status is not available for that card, Workfront will apply the system status instead (for example, On Hold). Also, if the status on the connected task or issue is changed to the custom or system status set in the column policy, the card is automatically moved to the column.</p>

For information on what's new and updated, see [What's new in API version 15](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/new-api-version-15.md).

For information on API versions, see [API versioning and support schedule](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/api-version-support-schedule.md).

### Workfront Maintenance Updates

### Functionality soon to be removed from Workfront

The following functionality is soon to be removed from Workfront:

#### **Changes to the Workfront Default API**

To ensure that API calls can take advantage of the most up-to-date Workfront API functionality, we're updating the Default API. When an API call does not specify a version of the API, the call is made to the Default API. 

Now, the Default API will reflect the most recent version of the API. Moving forward, we will update the Default API each time a new API version is released, so that calls to the Default API will always use the most recent version of the API.

Previously, the Default API used Workfront API version 2.0, which has been deprecated.

If your organization is currently using the deprecated Default API, your Workfront administrator has received an Announcement Center message with further instructions regarding the Default API. 

For more information, see [Update integrations that use default API versioning](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/update-default-api-versioning.md).
