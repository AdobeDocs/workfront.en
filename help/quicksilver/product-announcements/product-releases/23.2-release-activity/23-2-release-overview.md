## Release webinar

In lieu of a release webinar, we invite you to register for Adobe Summit to watch the following Workfront sessions:

[Impactful Experiences: From Content Creation to Personalization](https://reg.adobe.com/flow/adobe/as23/sessions/page/catalog/session/1661982243928001D5Z9) on March 21, 2023, to learn new ways to create, manage, and personalize content and deliver impactful experiences with greater efficiency. This session will be live streamed for virtual audiences.

[The Future of Adobe Workfront](https://reg.adobe.com/flow/adobe/as23/sessions/page/catalog/session/1661982239896001DoHU) on March 23, 2023, to see the vision for Workfront and its place within the Adobe ecosystem and get a sneak peek of the future roadmap. This session will be recorded and available later as on-demand content.

                        <p>You can now set a default status to apply to cards moved into a specific column, by selecting a custom status and a system status in the column policies. When you move a card into the column, Workfront first tries to apply the custom status (for example, Awaiting Feedback). If the custom status is not available for that card, Workfront will apply the system status instead (for example, On Hold). Also, if the status on the connected task or issue is changed to the custom or system status set in the column policy, the card is automatically moved to the column.</p>

## Announcements

### Workfront Fusion enhancements

New features in Workfront Fusion are available in Production at a cadence outside of the 23.2 release schedule. For more information about the latest features, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/fusion-release-activity/fusion-release-activity.md).

### Workfront Scenario Planner enhancements

There are no Scenario Planner updates at this point in the release. This area will be updated when updates are available.

### Workfront Proof enhancements

There are no Workfront Proof updates at this point in the release. This area will be updated when updates are available.

### Workfront Goals enhancements

New features coming to Workfront Goals release with the 23.2 release. For information about these new features now available in Preview, see [Adobe Workfront Goals with the 23.2 release](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/goals-release-activity/goals-23-2-release/goals-23-2-release.md).

### API version 16

API version 16 will be released with the 22.3 release. For API version 16, we've modified some resources and endpoints. Some of the changes support new functionality, and others make it easier for you to use the information available through the API.

For information on what's new and updated, see [What's new in API version 16](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/new-api-version-16.md).

For information on API versions, see [API versioning and support schedule](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/api-version-support-schedule.md).

### Workfront Maintenance Updates

For information about the maintenance updates made during the 23.2 release, see [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html).

### Training updates

Explore the latest updates made to learning programs, learning paths, videos, and guides for each Adobe Workfront product release. For more information, see the "What's New" section of the [Workfront Tutorials page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-learn/tutorials-workfront/home.html).

### Functionality soon to be removed from Workfront

The following functionality is soon to be removed from Workfront:

#### **Dashboard external pages no longer support dashboard URLs**

To improve dashboard stability and load times, external pages in dashboards will no longer be able to reference dashboard URLs. System administrators for accounts that contain any external pages referencing dashboards will receive an in-app notification to alert them of this change. For more information, see [Embed an external page in a dashboard](/help/quicksilver/reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/embed-external-web-page-dashboard.md).

#### **Changes to the Workfront Default API**

To ensure that API calls can take advantage of the most up-to-date Workfront API functionality, we're updating the Default API. When an API call does not specify a version of the API, the call is made to the Default API. 

Now, the Default API will reflect the most recent version of the API. Moving forward, we will update the Default API each time a new API version is released, so that calls to the Default API will always use the most recent version of the API.

Previously, the Default API used Workfront API version 2.0, which has been deprecated.

If your organization is currently using the deprecated Default API, your Workfront administrator has received an Announcement Center message with further instructions regarding the Default API. 

For more information, see [Update integrations that use default API versioning](/help/quicksilver/wf-api/api/update-default-api-versioning.md).
