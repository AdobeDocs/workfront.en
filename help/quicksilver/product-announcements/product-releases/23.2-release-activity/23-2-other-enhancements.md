# 23.2 Other enhancements

This page describes all other enhancements made with the 23.2 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 23.2 release. 

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 23.2 release cycle, see [23.2 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-2-release-overview.md).

## New to the Workfront for Creative Cloud plugins

We've added the following changes to the Workfront for Creative Cloud plugins:

* The plugin now notifies you when a task has a predecessor
* Korean is now a supported language

## New commenting experience for issues Beta

An update to the commenting experience in Adobe Workfront is currently in development. This update includes a new interface, new features, and improved performance in the Updates section of some objects. 

This new experience will eventually unify commenting across Adobe Workfront and beyond, throughout the Adobe Experience Cloud. 

As part of this update, we are introducing the new commenting experience to the Updates section of issues. With the current release, there will be a toggle available to each user to enable this experience in their own environment, in beta mode. After accepting the beta agreement, the new Updates section displays, and they can continue to manage their work in that section as they do now. 

Similar functionality was released to Workfront Goals with the 23.1 release. 

Some of the features included with this update are: 

* Separate tabs for comments and system updates 

* Better performance 

* Real-time indicator for new comments. 

* Editing comments after they are submitted.  

With this redesign, we have removed adding comments to system updates.  

More features will be added in future releases, as these enhancements continue to be added to other objects. 

For information about what the new commenting experience offers, see [New commenting experience](../../betas/new-commenting-experience-beta/unified-commenting-experience.md).

## Net new customers to be onboarded to Adobe Unified Experience

In mid to late March 2023, new customers will start to be onboarded to the Adobe Unified Experience. New customers will be handled case by case as they are onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform.

Migration of existing customers to the Unified Experience has been postponed to later in 2023. Any affected customers will be notified at that time.

The Adobe Unified Experience includes:

* A single login for all Adobe applications through Adobe Experience Cloud
* An "organization switcher" to move between Workfront organizations and environments
* Navigation with options for Workfront pages, Adobe Experience Cloud preferences, and your Workfront profile

For more information, see [Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/adobe-unified-experience.md).

Because of a technical requirement with the Unified Experience, the proofing viewer will now launch in a new browser tab.
