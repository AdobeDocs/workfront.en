## Net new customers to be onboarded to Adobe Unified Experience

In mid to late March 2023, new customers will start to be onboarded to the Adobe Unified Experience. New customers will be handled case by case as they are onboarded to the Adobe Business Platform.

Migration of existing customers to the Unified Experience has been postponed to later in 2023. Any affected customers will be notified at that time.

The Adobe Unified Experience includes:

* A single login for all Adobe applications through Adobe Experience Cloud
* An "organization switcher" to move between Workfront organizations and environments
* Navigation with options for Workfront pages, Adobe Experience Cloud preferences, and your Workfront profile

For more information, see [Adobe Unified Experience for Workfront](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/adobe-unified-experience.md).

## The proofing viewer opens in a new tab for users on the Unified Experience
