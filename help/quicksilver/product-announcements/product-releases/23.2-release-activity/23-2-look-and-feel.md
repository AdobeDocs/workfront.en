# Look and feel updates during the 23.2 release time frame

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the 23.2 release timeframe. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment a minimum of 2 weeks after releasing to Preview.

For a list of all changes available with the 23.2 release, see [23.2 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23.2-release-activity/23-2-release-overview.md).

## Smart user selection available in additional areas of Workfront

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: February 9, 2023; Planned Production release: February 23, 2023

Additional user information now displays when you add users in the following areas:

* Global search for users
* Log In As page (this page also now has a modern look and feel, in line with other areas of Workfront)
* New subtask form on an agile iteration story board
* Edit iteration dialog
* Create team dialog
* Edit team page
* Subscribe dialog
* Group Add members dialog

Now, when you add a user to the areas listed above, in addition to the user's name and avatar, their Primary Role and their email also display. This helps distinguish between multiple users with similar or identical names.

For more information, and to view a video demonstration of a similar feature, see "Smart user selection for project roles in the Edit and Details areas" in [22.4 Project enhancements](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/22.4-release-activity/22-4-project-enhancements.md).

## Updated Document version icon in Document Details

We've updated the look-and-feel of the Document version icon. The icon now displays a red dot noting when you're on a past version as well as a hover that says "Past version."
