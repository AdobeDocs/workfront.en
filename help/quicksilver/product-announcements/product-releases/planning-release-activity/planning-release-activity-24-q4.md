Adobe Workfront Planning is a new offering from Adobe Workfront. The purpose of Workfront Planning is to unlock comprehensive visibility into the operational details of an organization, and answer critical business questions at each stage of the work management lifecycle. 

The following are some of the main capabilities of Adobe Workfront Planning: 

* Solve the problem of planning work across all stages and for all the stakeholders that participate in the work process. 

* Fully customize your workflows, from deciding what object types (or record types) your organization uses to configuring how these objects interconnect.

* Connect to object types from other systems, creating a coherent framework for all your processes.
