The following are some of the main capabilities of Adobe Workfront Planning: 

* Solve the problem of planning work across all stages and for all the stakeholders that participate in the work process. 

* Fully customize your workflows, from deciding what object types (or record types) your organization uses to configuring how these objects interconnect.

* Connect to object types from other systems, creating a coherent framework for all your processes.
