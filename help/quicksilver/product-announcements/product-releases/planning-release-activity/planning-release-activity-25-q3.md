## Inline editing in the Connected records page of a record

>* Production fast release: May 15, 2025 
>* Production for all customers:  July 17, 2025

You can now edit records in the Connected records page of a record. With this update, we have introduced the following:   

* The name of the page has been changed from "Connection view" to "Connected records page".  
* Connected records displayed in this page are inline editable in the table view. Connected Workfront objects continue to display in a read-only table.  

Prior to this enhancement, the table of the Connection view page was read-only for record connections.  

For information, see [Manage the record page layout](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/manage-the-record-page.md).

## Planning area visible by default in the Main Menu for Standard-license  users

>* Production for all customers:  July 17, 2025

Standard and System Administrator users can now find the Planning area in the Main Menu by default, without being assigned to a layout template that includes it. All other users must have a layout template that includes the Planning area assigned to them in order to access it.   

Prior to this enhancement, users with all license levels had to be assigned to layout template modified to include the Planning area in the Main Menu in order to access this area.   
 
>[!NOTE]
>
>This change will be visible for all new and existing users with a System Administrator and Standard license. 
>Existing users assigned to a layout template will continue to see everything according to the settings defined in the layout template.  

For information, see [Adobe Workfront Planning overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/access-overview.md).

## Row-level color formatting in the table view

>* Production for all customers:  July 17, 2025

For better visibility of the important information of your records, we have introduced row-level color formatting for the table view. You can now choose a color for each row after you define conditions for each choice.  This is a new capability that did not exist before this update. 

For information, see [Manage the table view](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-the-table-view.md).

## New setting to truncate long record names in the Standard timeline view 

>[!NOTE]

>* Preview: April 23, 2025
>* Production fast release: May 15, 2025 
>* Production for all customers:  July 17, 2025

You can now enable a setting in the Bar style tab of the Settings box of a timeline view to truncate longer record names, when displaying them in the Standard view. The setting is disabled by default and can be enabled only when you display the timeline view in the Standard mode. As this setting is disabled, information on the record bars displays expanded, by default. Prior to this enhancement, information on the record bars was truncated by default.   

For information, see [Manage the timeline view](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-the-timeline-view.md).

## Sharing permissions for record types

>* Production for all customers: July 17, 2025

To better control who can view or manage records in each record type and ensure that only authorized people can manage each record type's information based on their roles and responsibilities, we have introduced permissions at the record type level. 

Prior to this enhancement, you could share only workspaces with others and the permission they were granted to a workspace applied to all the record types in the workspace.  

We have introduced the following updates:  

* Workspace permissions are automatically shared with all record types in the workspace. 
* The level of permissions granted for the workspace displays as Inherited permissions for the record type.  
* You cannot share a record type with a higher permission level than users have on the workspace.
* You can disable the inherited permissions on the record type to make it read-only for all people in the workspace. After that,  you can add individual people, teams, groups, companies or roles and grant them Contribute permission to the record type.  

For more information, see [Share record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-record-types.md).
