To better control who can view or manage records in each record type and ensure that only authorized people can manage each record type's information based on their roles and responsibilities, we have introduced permissions at the record type level. 

Prior to this enhancement, you could share only workspaces with others and the permission they were granted to a workspace applied to all the record types in the workspace.  

We have introduced the following updates:  

* Workspace permissions are automatically shared with all record types in the workspace. 
* The level of permissions granted for the workspace displays as Inherited permissions for the record type.  
* You cannot share a record type with a higher permission level than users have on the workspace.
* You can disable the inherited permissions on the record type to make it read-only for all people in the workspace. After that,  you can add individual people, teams, groups, companies or roles and grant them Contribute permission to the record type.  

For more information, see [Share record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-record-types.md).
