>Preview: January 29, 2026
>Production fast release: February 12, 2026
>Production for everyone: April 16, 2026

We have introduced a setting that allows you to show or hide record fields in a record's Details preview box, based on the fields displayed in the table view.  

With this new setting, you can choose whether to include or exclude fields that are hidden in the table view from the record's Details preview area. 

For information, see [Manage the record page layout](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/manage-the-record-page.md).

## New Planning connection field for Original request

>Production fast release: February 12, 2026
>Production for everyone: April 16, 2026

You can now add the "Original request" connection field to a record type. When a record is created by submitting a Planning request form, the name of the original request populates the Original request connected field.  

Prior to this enhancement, the you could view and access the original request that created the record only from the Requests area.  

For information, see [Connect record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/architecture/connect-record-types.md).

## Create approval rules for requests in Workfront Planning 

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: January 29, 2026
>Production fast release: February 12, 2026
>Production for everyone: April 16, 2026

To make request approvals more dynamic and flexible, we've added the ability to create approval rules. These rules allow requests to be routed to different approvers based on field values in the request. 

For example, if a request form has the field "Campaign type," a rule can be created that sends the request to one person when the field has the value "Digital", and a different person when it has the value "Print."

Approval rules are created on the request form.

For information and instructions, see [Add approval rules to a request form](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/add-approval-to-request-form.md#add-approval-rules-to-a-request-form) in the article Add an approval to a request form in Adobe Workfront Planning.

A user's email now displays when you add the user to the following areas: 

* People-type Planning fields

Prior to this enhancement, only the user's Primary Role displayed in addition to the user's name when adding them to these areas.
