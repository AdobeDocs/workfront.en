# Fourth Quarter 2025 release activity for Adobe Workfront Planning

This article describes the features that are releasing for Workfront Planning during the Fourth Quarter 2025 release. 

<!--keep the sentence below for all future quarterly release pages-->

For a list of all features released for Adobe Workfront Planning, see [Adobe Workfront Planning release activity: article index](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/planning-release-activity/planning-release-activity-article-index.md).

<!--## Unified request form list now available

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview: September 4, 2025
>* Production fast release: September 11, 2025
>* Production all: October 16, 2025

To make it easier to find the request form you're looking for in Workfront Planning, we've created a unified list for request forms. Now, all request forms that you have access to can be found in a single list, regardless of the object they were created for. Clicking on a form in this list brings you to the request form's page, where you can edit, preview, or publish and unpublish the form.

Previously, request forms were located only on the object for which they were created.

For more information on request forms, see [Create and manage a request form in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/create-request-form.md). -->

## Redesign of the Planning views toolbars and access points 

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview: September 25, 2025
>* Production fast release: October 15, 2025
>* Production all: October 16, 2025

We have redesigned how you display, access, and manage views on  a record type page.  

The following improvements are included in this update: 

* The view tabs have been replaced by a dropdown menu in the upper-left corner of the record type page. The menu now displays a list of all the views.
* You can reorder the views by dragging and dropping them in order of your preference. 
* Most of the toolbar icons, except for the full-screen mode, have moved from the right side to the left side of the page.  
* The Search box has been moved to the right side of the toolbar. 
The functionality of each view has not changed.  

For information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-record-views.md).  

<!--## Enhancements to request forms in Workfront Planning

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview: September 25, 2025
>* Production fast release: October 15, 2025
>* Production all: October 16, 2025

To make the request process simpler, we've made some enhancements to request forms. Now, when configuring a request form, you can configure the following:

* Configure when requests created from the form will be automatically marked complete. You can set the request to be marked complete when the requested object is created, or when the requested object is complete based on criteria you specify.
* Set up an automation that is triggered when a request is submitted from the form. Currently, you can automatically create records when the request is submitted. 

For more information on creating a request form and configuring these options, see [Create and manage a request form in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/create-request-form.md). -->

## Resize records in the calendar weekly view

>[!NOTE]

>* Preview: September 25, 2025
>* Production fast release: October 15, 2025
>* Production all: October 16, 2025

In the weekly calendar view of a record type page, you can now click and hold a record's left or right margins to modify its duration.  

Moving a record's margins also modifies its start and end dates immediately.  

An outline displays to guide you to the new location before the event is resized. 

This functionality already exists in the calendar monthly view. 

For more information, see [Edit records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/edit-records.md).

## New information box displays when changing or deleting a field

>[!NOTE]

>* Preview: September 11, 2025
>* Production fast release: October 15, 2025
>* Production all: October 16, 2025

When you update a formula field or a field that could impact it, an alert notifies you of the impact of your change. The alert displays in the following cases:

* When you update a formula field (excluding name and description changes) when that field has dependent formula or lookup fields. The alert lists those dependent fields and asks you whether you want to continue.

* When you delete a field that is used in a formula expression or as a lookup field. The alert lists the dependent formula and lookup fields and asks you whether you want to continue with the deletion.

For information, see [Formula fields overview](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/formula-fields.md).

>[!NOTE]

>[!BADGE Off schedule]{type=Neutral}

If your organization uses both Adobe Workfront Planning and Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you might want to define marketing concepts like Campaigns, Products, and Personas in more detail than what GenStudio supports by default.  
  
With the new native integration between GenStudio for Performance Marketing and Workfront Planning you can now manage the Campaigns, Products, Personas, Activations, Channels, and Regions used in GenStudio for Performance Marketing in Workfront Planning. The integration also enables you to configure GenStudio for Performance Marketing to reference existing record types from Workfront Planning, creating a more connected and consistent marketing workflow. 

The GenStudio for Performance Marketing workspace is now available in Adobe Workfront Planning when your company has purchased both products. 
With the integration between Workfront Planning and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, you can:  

* View the GenStudio workspace in Workfront Planning.  
* Modify your campaigns, products, personas, and activations in GenStudio for Performance Marketing and have real-time updates of the same information in Workfront Planning. 
* Modify your campaigns, products, personas, and activations in Workfront Planning and have real-time 
* Avoid duplicate data entry. 
* Maintain alignment across planning and activation efforts.

You can now add a new choice to a single- or multi-select field as you update the field value in the table view. For example, when the single-select field of Status has three choices and you want to have a fourth choice, you can add it as you edit the Status field of a record in the table view.

* For Workfront: [Create and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md)

You can now share a record type from the More menu of the record type card on the workspace page. Prior to this enhancement, the Share option was available only inside the record type page.

For information, see [Share record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-record-types.md).

## Add teams as approvers on Planning request forms

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: July 22, 2025 
>Production for fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for all customers: October 16, 2025 

To make the approval process more flexible, we've added the ability to add teams as approvers on Planning request forms. Now, you can enter and select team names when setting approvers. Any of the team members can make a decision, which counts as the approval decision for the entire team.

Previously, only individual users could be assigned as approvers. 

For more information, see [Add an approval to a request form in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/add-approval-to-request-form.md).

## New fields to display record approval information

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview: July 17, 2025 
>Production for fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for all customers: October 16, 2025 

We are introducing the following fields to capture approval information for records created by submitting a request with an approval: 

* Approved by

For information, see [Create fields](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/create-fields.md).

## Auto-populate fields based on applied groupings

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview: July 10, 2025 
>Production fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for all customers: October 16, 2025


Now, when you have  groupings applied to a table view, adding a record to the table will auto-populate the fields associated with the groupings you add the record to.  

If you have multiple groupings applied, the system auto-populates the fields associated with all groupings only when you add the record at the end of the list inside the last grouping criteria.  

Prior to this enhancement, you had to manually update the fields associated with groupings.  

For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).
