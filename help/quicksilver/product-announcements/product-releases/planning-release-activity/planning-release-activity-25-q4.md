>[!NOTE]

>[!BADGE Off schedule]{type=Neutral}

We have added new expressions with the following usage to formula fields in Workfront Planning and to calculated custom fields in Workfront:

* **REMOVEACCENTS(text)**: Removes diacritical marks from all accented characters in the input string.

* **REPLACEPATTERN (string, pattern, replacement string)**: Replaces the matches of the given pattern with the replacement string.

* **PASCALCASE(text)**: Converts the input string to PascalCase by capitalizing the first letter of each word and removing all spaces.

## Adding Maximize and Minimize buttons to the formula field creation window

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: July 31, 2025
>Production for all customers: July 31, 2025
>[!BADGE Off schedule]{type=Neutral}

We have added a Maximize button to enlarge the Formula field when creating or editing the field in a record table view. Additionally, we added a Minimize button in the new enlarged window to revert to the field creation box.

For information, see [Create fields](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/create-fields.md).

## The Connected records page is now available in a record's preview area 

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview: July 31, 2025
>* Production fast release: August 14, 2025
>* Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

We have now made the experience in the connected records page in the preview box match that of the page in the full page of a record's Details area.

Prior to this enhancement, viewing connected records in a connected records page was only possible in the full page of a record's Details area.

For information, see [Manage the record page layout](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/manage-the-record-page.md).

To create a better user experience when making requests in Workfront and Workfront Planning, we've updated the requesting experience. Now you can:

* View Workfront and Workfront Planning requests in a single list.
* Filter submitted requests based on criteria you specify.
* Search for and select Workfront request queues and Workfront Planning forms in a consolidated experience.
* Hide and reorder columns in the submitted requests list.

This update also features changes to the look and feel of the page.

Previously, Workfront and Workfront Planning requests were on separate tabs, and filters were not customizable.

For more information on creating requests see:

* For Workfront: [Create and submit requests](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md)
* For Workfront Planning: [Submit Adobe Workfront Planning requests to create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/submit-requests.md) -->

You can now create records in the timeline view of a record type by double-clicking anywhere on the timeline.

You can select the date range of your record or open the record's page to edit all its details.

Prior to this enhancement, you could only add new records using the New record button or inline in the table view.

For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).

## Add Share option in the More menu of a record type card 

>[!NOTE]

You can now share a record type from the More menu of the record type card on the workspace page. Prior to this enhancement, the Share option was available only inside the record type page.

For information, see [Share record types](/help/quicksilver/planning/access/share-record-types.md).

## Display all Workfront Planning views in full-screen mode

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview: July 24, 2025
>Production fast release: August 14, 2025
>Production for all customers: October 16, 2025

You can now display all Workfront Planning views (table, timeline, and calendar) in full-screen mode. The view functionality is preserved and you can change the view while in full-screen, as well.

Prior to this enhancement, this functionality did not exist.

For information, see [Manage record views](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-record-views.md).

## Add teams as approvers on Planning request forms

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: July 22, 2025 
>Production for fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for all customers: October 16, 2025 

To make the approval process more flexible, we've added the ability to add teams as approvers on Planning request forms. Now, you can enter and select team names when setting approvers. Any of the team members can make a decision, which counts as the approval decision for the entire team.

Previously, only individual users could be assigned as approvers. 

For more information, see [Add an approval to a request form in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/add-approval-to-request-form.md).

## New fields to display record approval information

>[!NOTE]

>Preview: July 17, 2025 
>Production for fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for all customers: October 16, 2025 

We are introducing the following fields to capture approval information for records created by submitting a request with an approval: 

* Approved by 
* Approval date 

For information, see [Create fields](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/create-fields.md).

## Auto-populate fields based on applied groupings

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview: July 10, 2025 
>Production fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for all customers: October 16, 2025


Now, when you have  groupings applied to a table view, adding a record to the table will auto-populate the fields associated with the groupings you add the record to.  

If you have multiple groupings applied, the system auto-populates the fields associated with all groupings only when you add the record at the end of the list inside the last grouping criteria.  

Prior to this enhancement, you had to manually update the fields associated with groupings.  

For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).
