For a list of all features released for Adobe Workfront Planning, see [Adobe Workfront Planning release activity: article index](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/planning-release-activity/planning-release-activity-article-index.md).

## New fields to display record approval information

>Preview: July 17, 2025 
>Production for fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for all: October 16, 2025 


We are introducing the following fields to capture approval information for records created by submitting a request with an approval: 

* Approved by 

* Approval date 

For information, see [Create fields](/help/quicksilver/planning/fields/create-fields.md).

## Auto-populate fields based on applied groupings

>Preview: July 10, 2025 
>Production fast release: August 14, 2025 
>Production for everyone: October 16, 2025 


Now, when you have  groupings applied to a table view, adding a record to the table will auto-populate the fields associated with the groupings you add the record to.  

If you have multiple groupings applied, the system auto-populates the fields associated with all groupings only when you add the record at the end of the list inside the last grouping criteria.  

Prior to this enhancement, you had to manually update the fields associated with groupings.  

For information, see [Create records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-records.md).

<!--## Add teams as approvers on Planning request forms

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Preview: July 9, 2025 
>* Production for everyone: October 16, 20025 

To make the approval process more flexible, we've added the ability to add teams as approvers on Planning request forms. Now, you can enter and select team names when setting approvers. Any of the team members can make a decision, which counts as the approval decision for the entire team.

Previously, only individual users could be assigned as approvers. 

For more information, see [Add an approval to a request form in Adobe Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/requests/add-approval-to-request-form.md).-->
