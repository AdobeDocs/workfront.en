## New Workfront field type for Planning connections 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: October 24, 2024; Production for fast release: With the 24.11 release (November 14, 2024); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.1 release (January 16, 2024)



To continue bridging Workfront objects to Workfront Planning records, we added a new field type in Workfront custom forms called Planning connection. By adding this field type on a Workfront custom form, and ultimately on a Workfront object, you can now do the following: 

* Display records connected to a Workfront object in the custom form.  

* Connect and disconnect Workfront Planning records form a Workfront object. 

You can add the new field to forms for all object types. However, you can edit the information in the field only from forms attached to the following Workfront objects that can be connected from Workfront Planning record types: Portfolio, Program, Project, Company, Group.  

Editing the Planning connection fields for Workfront objects in bulk is not yet available.
