# Second Quarter 2025 release activity for Adobe Workfront Planning

This article describes the features that are releasing for Workfront Planning during the Second Quarter 2025 release. 

<!--keep the sentence below for all future quarterly release pages-->

For a list of all features released for Adobe Workfront Planning, see [Adobe Workfront Planning release activity: article index](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/planning-release-activity/planning-release-activity-article-index.md).

## Copying and pasting external text is now supported for connections and People fields

>[!NOTE]
>
>Preview release: January 23, 2025; Production for fast release: With the 25.2 release (February 2025); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.4 release (April 2025)

You can now copy text from a source external to Workfront and paste it in a Workfront Planning connected field or a People-type field. This enhancement is available when editing records in the table view.  The text must match an existing user (for People-type fields) or an existing record or object (for a connected record). You can copy and paste multiple values for multiple fields and update records in bulk. 

Prior to this enhancement, you could only copy information from an existing Workfront Planning field and paste it in another field.  

For more information, see [Edit records](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/edit-records.md).

## Multi-tiered filters in record views

With this release, we have updated the filter builder in Workfront Planning to allow for multi-tier filters.  

The following improvements are part of this update: 

* You can use AND and OR filter operators to join multiple groups of filter conditions for more complex filters 

* The new filter builders are available in all record views: table, timeline, and calendar views 

Prior to this enhancement, you could add multiple filtering operators between single conditions and you could not join multiple condition groups together.  

For more information, see [Manage the table view](/help/quicksilver/planning/views/manage-the-table-view.md).

## Create projects using a template as you connect them from Workfront Planning records

>[!NOTE]

>Preview release: January 22, 2025; Production for fast release: With the 25.2 release (February 2025); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.4 release (April 2025)

You can now create projects using a template while you connect projects to existing records. 

For example, if you connect Workfront Planning campaigns with Workfront projects, and you determine that a particular project does not exist, you can add it as a new project in the connected record field. The project is then added to Workfront. You can also use a template for the new project.   

Prior to this enhancement, you could create blank projects, without a template.  

For information, see [Create Workfront objects from Workfront Planning](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/create-workfront-objects-from-workfront-planning.md).

## Improved display of record name and description in the record's details page and preview box

>[!NOTE]

>Preview release: January 22, 2025; Production for fast release: With the 25.2 release (February 2025); Production for quarterly release: With the 25.4 release (April 2025)

To give you better visibility to record titles on the header of the display page, we have made an improvement to give titles more space, prevent overlap, and handle truncation gracefully. 

As a result, longer record titles now wrap rather than being truncated when displayed in the details page and preview box. 

For information about the record's page, see [Manage the record page](/help/quicksilver/planning/records/manage-the-record-page.md).
