</a><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Coming soon to Production!</span></p> <p>This feature was removed from the 22.3 Production release. This feature is planned to release to Production at a future time.</p> 
<p>To give you more control over the approval processes and statuses in your system, we've made it possible to create an approval process based on an unlocked system status. Moreover, you can now unlock any status that is already used in an approval process. Previously, a system status used in an approval process had to be locked. This made it available for all groups—without the possibility of removing or renaming it—so group administrators couldn't streamline their group's list of statuses to fit their specific needs.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Based on your feedback, we've introduced the following enhancements to improve your experience when managing custom forms:

</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an Adobe XD file to make a custom form more visual and informative. When the form is attached to an object, users who work with the object can view and interact with the XD file from within the form.
</li>
<li>Use the Quick Filter to easily locate items in the modernized custom forms and fields list. Also enjoy an improved look and feel while managing your forms and fields.
</li>
</ol>
<p>After you add the team to the board, you can assign the team to cards. On connected cards, only one team assignment is allowed. On ad hoc cards, you can assign more than one team.

                        <p>To make it easier to find the right person when replacing job roles with users in the Workload Balancer in bulk, we have improved the way the list of available users populates.
