                        </p>
                        <p>Based on your feedback, we've introduced the following enhancements to improve your experience when managing custom forms:

</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an Adobe XD file to make a custom form more visual and informative. When the form is attached to an object, users who work with the object can view and interact with the XD file from within the form.
</li>
<li>Use the Quick Filter to easily locate items in the modernized custom forms and fields list. Also enjoy an improved look and feel while managing your forms and fields.
</li>
</ol>
<p>After you add the team to the board, you can assign the team to cards. On connected cards, only one team assignment is allowed. On ad hoc cards, you can assign more than one team.

                        <p>We are introducing a new object to Adobe Workfront that has the potential to change the way you manage work. </p>
                        <p>Workfront Campaigns enables you to organize projects from different portfolios and programs in a new work container.
Campaigns were released to Preview beta with the 22.3 release, in July 2022. For more information, see <a href="../../../product-announcements/product-releases/22.3-release-activity/22-3-project-enhancements.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">22.3 Project enhancements</a> </p>
<p>This new container will evolve in future releases to connect work objects that are currently managed in separate silos.</p>
