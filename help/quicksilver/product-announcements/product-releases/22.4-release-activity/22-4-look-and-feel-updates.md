# Look-and-feel updates during the 22.4 release time frame

This page describes minor updates to the look and feel of various areas of the Adobe Workfront application that were made within the 22.4 release timeframe. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment a minimum of 2 weeks after releasing to Preview.

For a list of all changes available with the 22.4 release, see [22.4 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/22.4-release-activity/22-4-release-overview.md).

## Look and feel updates to the licenses page

We've moved important license information to the top-right corner of the page and updated the look of the text and buttons to match other areas of Workfront.

For more information, see [Manage available licenses in your system](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/manage-available-licenses-in-your-system.md).
