# 22.4 release activity: Week of August 15, 2022

This page describes all enhancements made in the Preview environment the week of August 15, 2022. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the 22.4 release later this year.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the 22.4 release cycle, see [22.4 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/22.4-release-activity/22-4-release-overview.md).

## Custom form field calculation editor displays error information

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was first introduced in the Preview environment during the 22.3 release time frame. It releases to Production on September 1, 2022.

Editing calculations for custom fields is now easier with helpful error information indicated directly in the calculation. While you are creating a calculated field in a custom form, errors are highlighted in pink. When you hover over the highlighted portion, a tooltip displays to describe what the problem is.

For more information, see [Add calculated data to a custom form](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-calculated-data-to-custom-form.md).
