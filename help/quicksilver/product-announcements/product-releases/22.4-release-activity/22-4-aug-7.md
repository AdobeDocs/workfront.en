# 22.4 release activity: Week of August 7, 2022

## Expanded team description

In the Teams area, you can now view the full team description by clicking the description to display it in a pop-up. Any URLs in the description are clickable in the pop-up, and you can click in the description text to edit it (if you have access to edit the team settings). 

Previously, scrolling through the description in a narrow area was the only way to see all of the content.

This enhancement to the description applies to both agile and non-agile teams.

For more information, see [Create a team](/help/quicksilver/people-teams-and-groups/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team.md).
