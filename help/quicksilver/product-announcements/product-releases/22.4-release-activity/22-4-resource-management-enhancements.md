# 22.4 Resource Management enhancements

This page describes all Resource Management enhancements made with the 22.4 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available the week of October 3, 2022. 

For a list of all changes available with the 22.4 release, see [22.4 Release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/22.4-release-activity/22-4-release-overview.md).

## Show all users for the Workload Balancer of a project

To allow you to have visibility into all users in the system and their capacity without leaving the Workload Balancer of a project, we have added a “Show all users” option. When enabled, the project's Workload Balancer displays all the users in the system in the Assigned Work area. With this enhancement, you can easily identify who needs to be assigned to work listed in the Unassigned Work area. 

For more information, see [Assign work in the Workload Balancer by dragging and dropping](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/assign-work-in-workload-balancer-by-drag-and-drop.md).

## Show all users with a selected job role in the Workload Balancer when assigning work in bulk

To make it easier to find the right person when replacing job roles with users in the Workload Balancer in bulk, we have improved the way the list of available users populates. Now, you can view all users in the system that can fulfil the selected role in two separate areas in the same list of users:

* The first area (Suggested Assignments) displays users identified by the Smart Assignments logic. For more information, see [Smart assignments overview](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md).

* The second area (Other Assignments) displays all users that can fulfil the selected role.

Prior to this enhancement, you could view only the list of users available for assigning according to the Smart Assignments logic.

For information about assigning work in bulk using the Workload Balancer, see [Assign work in bulk using the Workload Balancer](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/assign-work-in-workload-balancer-in-bulk.md).

## Workload Balancer enhancements for Work-license users and Issue settings 

The following enhancements have been added to the Workload Balancer, in preparation for the deprecation of the Scheduling tools:  

* Work-license users can now adjust allocations when using the Workload Balancer of a project  

* Issues display in the Unassigned Work area when enabling the "Include hours from issues" setting 

Prior to these enhancements, only Plan-license users could adjust user allocations and issues displayed only in the Assigned Work area.  

For more information, see the following articles:  

* [Navigate the Workload Balancer](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md). 

* [Manage user allocations in the Workload Balancer](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/manage-user-allocations-workload-balancer.md). 

For more information about the deprecation of Scheduling, see [Deprecation of Resource Scheduling tools in Adobe Workfront](/help/quicksilver/resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/deprecate-resource-scheduling.md).
