# Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner with the 21.4 release

Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner is available only with the new Adobe Workfront experience.

The following features are included in the 21.4 release:

## Improved experience when filtering for plans and initiatives in the Scenario Planner

We have updated the filtering experience when you display plans or when you publish initiatives. We have replaced the large filter panel with a smaller drop-down menu.

For information, see the following articles:

* [Create and edit plans in the Scenario Planner](../../../scenario-planner/create-and-edit-plans.md) 
* [Update or create projects by publishing initiatives in the Scenario Planner](../../../scenario-planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.md)
