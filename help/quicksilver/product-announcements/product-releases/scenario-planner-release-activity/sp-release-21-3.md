# Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner with the 21.3 release

Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner is available only with the new Adobe Workfront experience.

The following features are included in the 21.3 release:

## Budget project resources in the Business Case using information from the Scenario Planner

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

To give those using the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner a single source of truth when budgeting resources for their projects, we have introduced a setting in the Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case of a project that allows you to select whether to use the Resource Planner or the Scenario Planner to budget resources for the project. When you select to use the Scenario Planner, job role information from the initiative linked to the project reflects in the Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case and calculates the Budgeted Labor Cost of the project.

This is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience for customers who have purchased a license for the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner.

For more information, see [Budget resources in the Business Case using the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/budget-resources-in-business-case-use-scenario-planner.md).

## Create pins and landing pages for Scenario Planner and Goals in a Layout Template

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

To have consistency when accessing all areas of Adobe Workfront listed in the Main Menu, we have added the ability for a Workfront or group administrator to add a pinned tab and a landing page for the Scenario Planner and the Goals areas when they update a layout template.

Prior to this enhancement you could add the Scenario Planner and the Goals area only to the Main Menu using a layout template.

For information, see the following articles:

* [Customize the landing page using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-landing-page.md) 
* [Customize pinned pages using a layout template](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-pinned-pages.md)
