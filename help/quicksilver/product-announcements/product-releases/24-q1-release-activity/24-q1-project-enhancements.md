## AI-driven smart assignments

>[!NOTE]

>Production for fast release: With the 24.2 release (February 2024); Production for all customers: With the 24.4 release (April 2024)

We have changed the algorithm that Workfront uses to calculate and suggest smart assignments for tasks. The new algorithm applies in the following areas in Workfront where you assign a task: task lists, the Assignments area in the task header, Home, and the Summary panel. 

Now, the algorithm looks at the following information when it suggests smart assignments:  

* Similarities between task, project, and portfolio names. 

* Frequency with which an assignment is made to a task with a similar name. 

If the new algorithm finds no matches, the existing criteria for calculating smart assignments are applied.  

Also consider the following: 

* The name of the smart assignments list in a task list changed in the task list from "Here are a few suggestions" to "Suggested assignments". 

* There are no changes in the way smart assignments are calculated for issues. The name of the smart assignment list in an issue list is "Here are a few recommendations".
