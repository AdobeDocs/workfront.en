We have changed the algorithm that Workfront uses to calculate and suggest smart assignments for tasks. The new algorithm applies in the following areas in Workfront where you assign a task: task lists, the Assignments area in the task header, Home, and the Summary panel. 

Now, the algorithm looks at the following information when it suggests smart assignments:  

* Similarities between task, project, and portfolio names. 

* Frequency with which an assignment is made to a task with a similar name. 

If the new algorithm finds no matches, the existing criteria for calculating smart assignments are applied.  

Also consider the following: 

* The name of the smart assignments list in a task list changed in the task list from "Here are a few suggestions" to "Suggested assignments". 

* There are no changes in the way smart assignments are calculated for issues. The name of the smart assignment list in an issue list is "Here are a few recommendations".  

For more information, see [Smart assignments overview](/help/quicksilver/manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md).
