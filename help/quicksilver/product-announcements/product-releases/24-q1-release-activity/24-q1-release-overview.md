# First Quarter 2024 release overview

This page provides information about functionality that is included in the First Quarter 2024 release scheduled for January 2024. 

The enhancements on this page are available in the Preview environment. This page will be updated with additional enhancements as the First Quarter 2024 release nears its planned Production release.

The 24.1 release webinar will be held on January 11, 2024. You can [register for the webinar here](https://webinars.on24.com/adobe_workfront/whatsnewin241?partnerref=releaseoverview).

<span class="preview">Off-cycle features (those releasing to Production prior to the First Quarter 2024 release date) are highlighted in yellow.</span>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The 23.3 release included the option to move your organization to monthly releases. Therefore, Workfront has changed the numbering scheme of releases to account for both monthly and quarterly release tracks.
>
>Monthly and quarterly releases are planned to be available on the Thursday of the second full week of the month, unless otherwise specified.
>
