# First Quarter 2024 Integration enhancements

This page describes all integration enhancements made with the First Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the First Quarter 2023 release.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23-q4-release-activity/23-q4-release-overview.md).

## Automatically publish assets in Adobe Experience Manager 

We've added another workflow to the Adobe Experience Manager integration. Now, you can set your assets to automatically publish when sent to Adobe Experience Manager. The integration can be configured to publish to the Adobe Experience Manager publish service, or to an Adobe Experience Manager brand portal.

The Automatic Publish workflow can be enabled and configured in the Adobe Experience Manager integration. When enabled, the workflow can be edited on the project template or project level.
