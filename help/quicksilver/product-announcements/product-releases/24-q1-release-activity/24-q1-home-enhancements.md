# First Quarter 2024 Home enhancements

This page describes all home enhancements made with the First Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the First Quarter 2024 release.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/24-q1-release-activity/24-q1-release-overview.md).

## New Pending approvals widget available

To make it easier for you to see the status of approvals and reviews on projects you own, we've added a new Pending Approvals widget to Home. Here, you can see a list of users assigned to approve or review documents on projects you own, see the status of their review or approval, and remind reviewers and approvers to complete their review or approval.

For more information on Home widgets, see [Get started with the new Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).

## Administrator controls for new Home using layout templates

Administrators can now customize new Home for users using layout templates. Customization options include selecting mandatory widgets and their position, choosing a background, and widget-specific options for choosing available filters and groups (and setting defaults).

Note that administrator layout template choices override individual users' customization; i.e., when changes to a layout template are saved, users on that layout template will have their new Home page changed to match the layout template and their existing widget selections will pushed to the bottom of the page. While widgets selected by the administrator may be repositioned by a user, they cannot be removed.

For more information, see [Customize new Home using a layout template](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-new-home-layout-template.md).

## My Work quick action buttons changed to only display on mouseover

To improve performance, the quick action buttons available in the My Work widget will now only be displayed when a work item is hovered over with the mouse. 

For more information on the quick action buttons available in the My Work widget, see [Get started with New Home](/help/quicksilver/workfront-basics/using-home/new-home/get-started-with-new-home.md).
