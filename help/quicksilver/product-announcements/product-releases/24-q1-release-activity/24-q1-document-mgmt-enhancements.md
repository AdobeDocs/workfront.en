# First Quarter 2024 Document management enhancements

This page describes all document management enhancements made with the First Quarter 2024 release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment with the First Quarter 2024 release.

For a list of all changes available at this point in the First Quarter 2024 release cycle, see [First Quarter 2024 release overview](/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/23-q4-release-activity/23-q4-release-overview.md).

## Document review and approval status displays in document header

To make the review and approval process more transparent, we've added the status to the header of the Document Details page. Now, you can see at a glance the approval decision made on the document, or whether the document is still under review.

For information on specific statuses, see [Document approval status](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-document-approvals/document-approval-status.md).

## Mark a review as complete

To make it more clear when a document has been reviewed and is ready for the next approval stage, we've created a new **Complete my review** button. Now, when a user who is set as a reviewer has reviewed a document, they can click the **Complete my review** button to record in Workfront that the review is complete.

This is not an approval or rejection document, since the user is a reviewer instead of an approver.

Previously, the user could make a comment that the asset had been reviewed, but not mark it as complete.

For more information, see [Review a document](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/review-and-approve-documents/review-a-document.md).
