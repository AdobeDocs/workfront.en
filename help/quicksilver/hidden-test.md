## Test of preview highlighting

<div class="preview">

Start of DIV.

Last highlighted item.

</div>

DIV ends above.

**Use SPAN for paragraphs or phrases**

This is a paragraph. <span class="preview">I am yellow text.</span> Remember to close your syntax properly, or the page might render oddly.

DIV and SPAN are also useful in HTML tables.

**Other supported HTML elements**

You can also specify the `class="preview"` syntax in `<p>`, `<td>`, `<tr>`, and so on. Make sure you test on preview.
