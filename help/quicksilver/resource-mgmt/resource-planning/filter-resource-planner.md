Using filters, you can modify what information displays in the Resource Planner from all the information that is stored in the system.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro and higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Review or higher<!--
      <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
        (this seems to be the case in NWE only, not classic. Waiting on Vazgen's response for this)
      </MadCap:conditionalText>
     --></p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;Projects, Users, and Resource Management </p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions or higher for projects</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Overview of Resource Planner filters

To minimize the amount of information displayed in the Resource Planner, Adobe Workfront provides a Default Filter with preconfigured criteria. For information about the Default Filter, see the section [Overview of the Default Filter in the Resource Planner](#overview-of-the-default-filter-in-the-resource-planner) in this article.

You can also build customized filters. For information of customizing filters in the Resource Planner, see the section [Create Resource Planner filters](#create-resource-planner-filters) in this article.

Consider the following when using filters in the Resource Planner:

* The filters you create are visible only to you. You can share filters to make them available to other users.
* As a Workfront administrator, you can only see filters you create or that are shared with you. 
* The filtered results do not change when you select a different view for the Resource Planner.  
  For more information about changing the view in the Resource Planner, see the "Project/ Role/ User view" selection section in [Resource Planner navigation overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planner-navigation.md).

* Applying a filter does not change the allocation and availability data in the Resource Planner for projects, roles, or users. A filter changes only the number of objects that you see in the Resource Planner. 
* Filtering applies to all the objects that display in the Resource Planner at the same time. For example, if you filter for a specific user, the Resource Planner displays only the following results:

   * Projects where that user is part of the Resource Pool (for the Project and Role views) or has an assignment on the project (for the User view)
   * Roles associated with the user on those projects  
     Other roles or users on the projects that the user is associated with do not display.

## Overview of the Default Filter in the Resource Planner {#overview-of-the-default-filter-in-the-resource-planner}

When you open the Resource Planner for the first time, Workfront applies the Default filter. You can edit the Default filter to filter for only the items you want displayed. For information on modifying a filters, see the section [Edit a filter in the Resource Planner](#edit-a-filter-in-the-resource-planner) in this article.

Consider the following when using the Default filter:

* The Default Filter retrieves information only from projects with the following:

   * A Planned Completion Date that occurs after the first date of the current month
   * A Planned Start Date that occurs before the last day of the fourth month from the current date
   * A Status of Current or Planning

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >The Default filter retrieves information from the projects occurring always within four months starting with the first day of the current month, regardless of the timeframe you select to the display in the Resource Planner.

* In the User View, all users in the system display but only the users associated with the filtered projects show hour information.
* You can edit the information in the Default filter without saving the filter.
* You can duplicate and edit a copy of the Default filter, change desired criteria in it, then save it as a new filter.
* You cannot delete or share the Default filter.

## Create Resource Planner filters {#create-resource-planner-filters}

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(Alina: **^ This section is somewhat duplicated (format more than content) from the "Filtering Utilization Information" section in "Viewing Utilization Information for Projects, Programs, and Portfolios.")</p>
-->

Creating a filter in the Resource Planner is identical for all the views.

Ensure that the prerequisites for viewing the correct information in the Resource Planner are in place before you create a filter.   
For information about meeting the necessary prerequisites for working with the Resource Planner, see the "Prerequisites for working in the Resource Planner" section in the [Resource Planner overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md) article.

Consider the following as you create a filter:

* There is no limit on the number of objects you can filter for at one time.
* The available fields you can add to a filter change according to the object of the view you apply to the Resource Planner. For example, you can filter for Issue or Task fields only in the User View because these objects display only in the User View. If you build a filter for Issues or Tasks in the User view and then apply it to the Project or Role views, it is ignored because the fields don't exist in the Project or Role views. In this case, the filter appears unavailable.

To create a filter in the Resource Planner:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront.

1. Click **Resourcing**.

   The **Planner** displays by default.

   By default, the first time you access the Resource Planner, the <strong>Default Filter</strong> is applied.<br>For more information about the Default filter, see the <a href="#overview-of-the-default-filter-in-the-resource-planner" class="MCXref xref">Overview of the Default Filter in the Resource Planner</a> section in this article.  

1. In the upper-left corner of the , click the **Filter** icon.  
   ![filter_icon.png](assets/filter-icon.png)  
   Or   
   Expand the **Filter** drop-down menu and click **Add New Filter**.   
   ![](assets/rp-filter-dropdown-expanded-with-default-filter-selected-350x283.png)  

1. To build a filter using the built-in criteria, specify any of the following fields:

   * **Portfolio**: Begin typing the name of the portfolio that contains the information you want to include in the Resource Planner, then click the name when it appears in the list.  
     Repeat this process to include information from multiple portfolios.
   
   * **Project Status**: Expand the Project Status drop-down menu and select one or multiple project statuses available in the list. 
   * **Team**: Begin typing the name of one or multiple teams associated with the users assigned to tasks in the projects you want to view.
   * **Job Role**: Begin typing the name of one or multiple job roles associated with the users assigned to tasks in the projects you want to view.
   * **Pools**: Begin typing the name of one or multiple Resource Pools that are associated with the projects (for the Project View), the users (for the User View), or associated with both the projects and the users (for the Role View) that you want to view. 
   * **Group**: Begin typing the name of one or multiple groups associated with the users (in the User view) or projects (in the Project and Role views) that you want to view.

1. Click **Add Filter Rule**, then begin typing the field name that you want to filter by in the **Type to filter items** box. If the field is available, it populates for each object where it can be associated.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >When referencing custom fields, you must type the field name and not the field label. The field label displays on a custom form attached to an object. For information about the difference between the label and the name of a custom field, see  [Create or edit a custom form](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md) .

1. Click the name of the field to add it to the filter when it appears in the list.  
   For more information about the fields you see in the list, see [Glossary of Adobe Workfront terminology](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/workfront-terminology-glossary.md). 

1. (Optional) Select the filter and condition modifiers for the filter. The available modifiers are described in [Filter and condition modifiers](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/filter-condition-modifiers.md).

   You can use user-based or date-based wildcards to filter for information associated with the logged-in user.   
   For information about supported wildcards in filters, see [Wildcard filter variables](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/understand-wildcard-filter-variables.md).

1. Click **Save**to save the filter rule.
1. (Optional) Click **Add Filter Rule** to add a new rule for another object or field.
1. Click **Apply** to apply the filter without saving it.

   Or

   Click **Save Filter** to save the filter.  
   ![RP_Apply_or_Save_buttons_on_filters.png](assets/rp-apply-or-save-buttons-on-filters-320x79.png)

1. (Conditional) After you click **Save**, specify a name for the filter in the **Filter Name** box inside the **Save Filter** dialog box. This is a required field.  
   ![RP_new_save_filter_box__with_Save_button__without_apply.png](assets/rp-new-save-filter-box--with-save-button--without-apply-350x175.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If your filter name includes special characters, you use only the following characters:
   >
   >* Comma
   >* Slash
   >* Hyphen
   >* Underscore

1. Click **Save**.

   The results in the Resource Planner are now filtered by the information you included in the filter rules.
