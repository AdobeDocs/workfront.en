# Remove users from resource pools

Although there is no limit to how many users you can have in a&nbsp;resource pool, the list of users only displays the first 2000 users, listed alphabetically.

We recommend that you remove users that have been deactivated or have moved roles or departments, to ensure you always have an accurate list of users in all resource pools.

For more information about resource pools, see [Resource pools overview](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/work-with-resource-pools.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro and higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Resource Management that includes access to Manage Resource Pools</p> <p>View or higher access to Users</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> <!--
   <tr data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> 
    <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
    <td> <p>(NOTE:&nbsp;I don't think this is needed for removing users from the pool)</p> <p>Manage permissions for the projects, templates, and users you associate the Resource Pools with</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
   </tr>
  --> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
