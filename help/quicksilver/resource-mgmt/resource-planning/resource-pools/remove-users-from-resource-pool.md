# Remove users from resource pools

{{preview-and-fast-release-Q424}}

Although there is no limit to how many users you can have in a resource pool, the list of users only displays the first 2000 users, listed alphabetically.

We recommend that you remove users that have been deactivated or have moved roles or departments, to ensure you always have an accurate list of users in all resource pools.

For more information about resource pools, see [Resource pools overview](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/work-with-resource-pools.md).

## Remove users from a Resource Pool

You can remove users from a Resource Pool when those users are no longer needed in that pool.

To remove a user from a Resource Pool:

{{step1-to-resourcing}}

1. Click **Resource Pools** in the left panel.  
1. Select a Resource Pool and click **Edit**.
   Or  
   Click the name of a Resource Pool.

1. Start typing the name of a user that you want to remove in the **Search in this Resource Pool** field.  
   Or  
   Start typing the name of a company, job role, team, or group, if you want to remove all the users associated with those entities.
