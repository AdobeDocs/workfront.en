You can use the Adobe Workfront Resource Management tools to forecast the allocation of your resources so that you know with accuracy whether your projects are delivered on time and on budget. For an overview of Resource Management in Workfront, see [Get started with Resource Management](../../resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/get-started-resource-management.md).

You can use resource planning tools to manage your job roles, their availability, and general allocation to projects based on this availability.

Budgeting users' general allocation to projects does not assign them to actual work (tasks and issues). You must assign your resources to work by using the Workload Balancer.

For more information about scheduling resources in Workfront using the Workload Balancer, see [Workload Balancer overview](../workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md). 

## Resource planning tools in&nbsp;Workfront

To budget time for your resources for the projects you plan to assign them to, you can use the following tools:

* For budgeting allocations for and prioritize multiple projects at the system-level: use the system-level Resource Planner.

  You can access the Resource Planner by going to the  Planner section  in the  Resourcing area.

  For information about the Resource Planner, see [Resource Planner overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).

* For budgeting allocations for a single project: use the project-level Resource Planner in the Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case of a the project. For information about budgeting resources for one project, see the article [Budget resources in the Business Case](../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/budget-resources-in-business-case.md).

  To manage users and organize them in pools based on common skills or departmental structure and then manage their allocations for the projects they are assigned to, you must create resource pools.&nbsp;For more information about creating resource pools, see [Create resource pools](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/create-resource-pools.md).

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >The Resource Budgeting area of a project is the Resource Planner at the project level. When you budget resources in the Business Case of a project, the information is also reflected in the system-level Resource Planner.

* For managing resources at a high-level, across multiple initiatives, and align your work with your organization's strategy, use the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner. The Scenario Planner requires an additional license. For information about the Workfront Scenario Planner, see [The Scenario Planner overview](../../scenario-planner/scenario-planner-overview.md).

  You can use the Resource Planner both at the system-level, across multiple projects, as well as to budget resources for a single project in the Resource Budgeting area of the business case. For more information about budgeting resources for a project in the business case, see [Budget resources in the Business Case](../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/budget-resources-in-business-case.md).

## The purpose of the resource planning tools

* Using the Resource Planner you can do the following:

   * Prioritize your projects to decide which projects should receive resources first. (Only in the Resource Planner)
   * Understand the availability of your resources based on the schedule of your users.
   * Budget hour, FTE, or cost allocations for your resources (users and job roles) for the projects to which they are assigned.

  For information about working in the Resource Planner, see the article [Resource Planner overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).

* Using the Scenario Planner, you can build enterprise-level plans across multiple initiatives that outline your company's overall strategic outcomes. For more information, see [Get started with the Scenario Planner](../../scenario-planner/get-started-with-scenario-planning.md). 

  The Scenario Planner requires an additional license. For information about the Workfront Scenario Planner, see [The Scenario Planner overview](../../scenario-planner/scenario-planner-overview.md).
