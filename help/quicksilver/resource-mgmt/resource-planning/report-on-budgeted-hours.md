# Report on Resource Planner Budgeted Hours

You can budget resources on your projects by using the Resource Planner. For information about budgeting your resources using the Adobe Workfront Resource Planner, see the article [Budget resources in the Resource Planner using the Project and Role views](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/budget-resources-project-role-views-resource-planner.md).

Budgeting resources means that you define (or budget) a certain number of hours that the resources on a project need to complete their work on the project. To share the budgeted hour information that you enter in the Resource Planner with other users who might not have access to the Resource Planner, you can build a Budgeted Hour report. For information, see [Report: Budgeted Hour](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/report-budgeted-hour.md).

<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">When you want to share Budgeted Hour information with other users who do not have access to the Resource Planner, you can do so by building a Budgeted Hour report. You can then share the report with them.</p>

>[!IMPORTANT]

><p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Budgeted Hours are updated every hour in the Adobe Workfront database. Refreshing the report does not necessarily refresh the hour information in it. You can view the time lapsed since the last update in the upper-right corner of every Budgeted Hour report. Refreshing the report refreshes the information in it only when there has been more than one hour since the last update. </p>>
