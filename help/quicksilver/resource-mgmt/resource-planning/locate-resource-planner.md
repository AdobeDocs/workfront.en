## Prerequisites

Ensure that all prerequisites for accessing and working with the Resource Planner are met before starting to use it. This way, you ensure that the Resource Planner displays the correct information before you start budgeting your resources.

For information about Resource Planner prerequisites, see [Get started with Resource Planning](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planning.md).

You can locate the Resource Planner in two areas of Workfront, depending on whether you want to budget your resources for multiple projects, or for just one project.

* [Use the Resource Planner for multiple projects](#use-the-resource-planner-for-multiple-projects) 
* [Use the Resource Planner for one project](#use-the-resource-planner-for-one-project)

### Use the Resource Planner for multiple projects {#use-the-resource-planner-for-multiple-projects}

When using the Resource Planner for multiple projects, the allocation numbers for your resources represent numbers across multiple projects.

To access the Planner section in the Resourcing area:

{{step1-to-resourcing}}

   The Planner displays by default.  For information about budgeting resources in the Resource Planner, see the article [Budget resources in the Resource Planner using the Project and Role views](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/budget-resources-project-role-views-resource-planner.md).

   ![](assets/qs-resource-management-area-with-planner-as-default-350x152.png)

1. Click **Resource Pools** in the left panel.
   For information about creating resource pools, see [Create resource pools](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/create-resource-pools.md).

### Use the Resource Planner for one project {#use-the-resource-planner-for-one-project}

When using the Resource Planner for one project, the allocation numbers for your resources represent numbers for the selected project.

1. Go to a project you want to budget resources for.
1. Click **Business Case** in the left panel.
1. Scroll to the **Resource Budgeting** section of the Business Case.
1. Click **Edit Resource Budgeting** to add resource pools to your project and start budgeting your resources.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can only add a resource pool in the Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case when the project has no resource pools associated with it. When the project already has a Resource Pool, the users in the pool and their job roles display in the Resource Budgeting area by default.
