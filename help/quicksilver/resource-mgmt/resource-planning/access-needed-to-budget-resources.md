<p><b>(LINKED TO PRODUCT</b>: This is also linked to the product, in two different tooltips in the RP:</p>
<p>- the tooltip for the View-only mode of the Budgeted Hours boxes. You gave this link to Vazgen and the team for the tooltip and documented this in this sheet:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zKjNVw_TyfQ474jbY7JorSWTkptMNb5RFCck2IficYs/edit#gid=0</p>

<p>This might need to be moved to Resource Management overview and title needs to be changed to "Acces needed to manage resources" when the res manager prerequisite will drop for resource scheduling and the field goes away.</p>
<p>This should be linked from Planning in the Resource Planner - in the Budgeting Resources in the RP area)</p>

When your company has purchased an Adobe Workfront license that includes Resource Planning you can view resource budgeting information for the projects that you have permissions to view. You can view budgeting information in the Resource Planner. 

For additional information about prerequisites for using the budgeting tools in Workfront, see [Get started with Resource Planning](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planning.md).

In order to budget resources, manage Resource Pools, and see Cost information in the resource planning tools, your company and you must have the following access:&nbsp;
