# Adjust budgeting dates in the Resource Planner

If you find that there are overallocations of your resources after you have budgeted them in the Resource Planner, you can explore what-if scenarios by moving the Budgeted Hours, FTE, or Costs to another time frame. Based on the findings in these scenarios, you can then adjust your budgeted Hours, FTE, or Cost.

Overallocations can appear when the Budgeted Hours, FTE, or Costs of your resources are higher then their Available Hours, FTE, or Costs. This generates a negative Net value.
