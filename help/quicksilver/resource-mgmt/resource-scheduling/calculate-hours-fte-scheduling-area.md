title: Configure how Workfront calculates resource hour and FTE availability for the Scheduling area
description: "NOTE: Alina: ***Note that the FTE for scheduling is not yet working the same way as the FTE for planning - confirmed with Vazgen and this parity is planned for the future, but not right now.

<p>NOTE: Alina: ***Note that the FTE for scheduling is not yet working the same way as the FTE for planning - confirmed with Vazgen and this parity is planned for the future, but not right now.

>We are no longer developing the Resource Scheduling tools and they will soon be removed from Adobe Workfront. We recommend that you use the Workload Balancer for scheduling your resources.

The Adobe Workfront administrator determines how Workfront calculates resource availability and user allocation at the system level (considering hours as well as FTE availability) when they configure Resource Management preferences.

They can select to use one of the following:

* The Default Schedule of the system and the user's FTE. 
* The user's schedule.&nbsp;

For more information, see [Configure Resource Management preferences](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md).

This setting affects user availability in the following circumstances when scheduling resources:

* When allowing Workfront to automatically assign resources, as described in the following article:

   * [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

     -->

* When displaying allocation indicators, as described in the following article:

   * The section "Allocation indicators" in the article&nbsp; [Manage user allocations in the Scheduling areas](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manage-allocations-scheduling-areas.md).

<li value="5"> Select to calculate the availability of users in Workfront using&nbsp;one of the following methods:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Default Schedule</strong>:&nbsp;The Default Schedule of the system and the user FTE are used to determine the Available Hours and FTE value for the user when scheduling resources. The Schedule of the user is ignored. In this case:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li> The&nbsp;<strong>Available Hours</strong> for a user when scheduling resources<strong></strong>are calculated using the following formula:<br><code>User Available Hours = Default Schedule Hours * User FTE </code><em><code>value</code>&nbsp;</em><br>For example, if the&nbsp;Default Schedule has 40 hours a week available for work, and the user FTE is 0.5, the user is available to work for 20 hours a week in the Scheduling area.<br>For more information about schedules, including the Default Schedule, see&nbsp;<a href="../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md" class="MCXref xref">Create a schedule</a>.</li>
<li> The&nbsp;<strong>Available FTE</strong>for the user when scheduling resources<strong></strong>is the same as the user FTE specified in the user settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>For example, if the user FTE is 0.5 in the user settings, the available FTE of the user is 0.5 in the Resource Planner.&nbsp;For more information about the value of the user FTE as it displays in the user settings, see&nbsp;<a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md" class="MCXref xref">Edit a user's profile</a>.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The User's Schedule</strong>: The Schedule of the user&nbsp;is used to determine the availability of the user when scheduling resources.&nbsp;The value of the user FTE is ignored. In this case:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li> The&nbsp;<strong>Available Hours</strong>in the<strong>Resource Planner</strong>are the same as the Hours from the Schedule of the user.<br>For example, if the Schedule of the user has 40 hours a week available&nbsp;for work, the user is available to work for 40 hours a week in the Resource Planner.&nbsp; </li>
<li> The&nbsp;<strong>Available FTE</strong>in the<strong>Resource Planner</strong>&nbsp;is calculated by the following formula:<br><em>User Available FTE =&nbsp;Hours from the Schedule of the User/ Default Schedule Hours<br></em>For example, if the Schedule of the user has 20 hours available to work, and the Default Schedule in Workfront has 40 hours available to work, the user's FTE is 0.5.<br>For more information about schedules, including the Default Schedule, see&nbsp;<a href="../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md" class="MCXref xref">Create a schedule</a>.</li>
