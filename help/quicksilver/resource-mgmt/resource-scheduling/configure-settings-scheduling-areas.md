You can configure various settings to customize how and what information displays in the scheduling timeline.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article::

<table style="table-layout:auto">

## Configure issues to display on the scheduling timeline

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: ALL THE SECTIONS BELOW ARE LINKED TO PRODUCT. DO NOT CHANGE TITLES) </p>
-->

You can configure issues to be displayed in addition to tasks on the scheduling timeline.   
When scheduling resources  in the Scheduling section for a team , issues are displayed by default in addition to tasks. When scheduling resources for projects, only tasks are displayed by default.

1. Go to the scheduling timeline for multiple projects, for an individual project, or for a team:

   * **For multiple projects**:&nbsp;  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, click **Resourcing > Workload Balancer**, then select **Scheduling** in the upper-left drop-down menu. 
   * **For an individual project**:  Go to a project, click the **Workload Balancer** section in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu. 
   * **For a team**:  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click **Teams**, select a team, click **Workload Balancer** in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu.

1. Click the **Settings** icon on the scheduling timeline.  

1. On the Resource Scheduling Settings dialog box, enable the&nbsp;**Show Issues**&nbsp;option.  
   ![RS_scheduling_tab_all_settings__1_.png](assets/rs-scheduling-tab-all-settings--1--350x417.png)

1. Click **Return to Scheduling**.&nbsp;

## Configure completed work to display on the scheduling timeline

You can configure the scheduling timeline to display work that has already been marked as Complete. By default, completed work is not displayed on the scheduling timeline.&nbsp;

1. Go to the scheduling timeline for multiple projects, for an individual project, or for a team:

   * **For multiple projects**:&nbsp;  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, click **Resourcing > Workload Balancer**, then select **Scheduling** in the upper-left drop-down menu. 
   * **For an individual project**:  Go to a project, click the **Workload Balancer** section in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu. 
   * **For a team**:  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click **Teams**, select a team, click **Workload Balancer** in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu.

   ![RSS_show_completed_work_disabled__1_.png](assets/rss-show-completed-work-disabled--1--350x336.png)

1. Click **Return to Scheduling**.  
   Completed work is displayed with a checkmark in the upper-right corner of the work item.

## Configure Project Names to display on the scheduling timeline&nbsp;

You can configure the project name to display on each task and issue on the scheduling timeline. This allows users viewing the scheduling timeline to quickly see the name of the project where the task or issue resides.

When you enable project names to display, each task and issue consumes more vertical space on the scheduling timeline, resulting in fewer tasks and issues displaying in a single view.

By default, project names are not displayed on tasks and issues on the scheduling timeline.

To display project names on tasks and issues on the scheduling timeline:

1. Go to the scheduling timeline for multiple projects or for a team:

   * **For multiple projects**:&nbsp;  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, click **Resourcing > Workload Balancer**, then select **Scheduling** in the upper-left drop-down menu. 
   * **For a team**:  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click **Teams**, select a team, click **Workload Balancer** in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu.

1. Click the **Settings** icon on the scheduling timeline.  

1. On the Resource Scheduling Settings dialog box, enable the option,&nbsp;**Show Project Names**.  
   ![RS_scheduling_tab_all_settings__2_.png](assets/rs-scheduling-tab-all-settings--2--350x348.png)

1. Click **Return to Scheduling**.  
   Each task and issue on the scheduling timeline displays the name of the project where the task or issue resides.

## Configure Projected Dates to display on the scheduling timeline

By default, Planned Dates are used on the scheduling timeline. Alternatively, you can configure the scheduling timeline to use Projected Dates.

Consider the following information about Planned and Projected Dates:

* Planned Dates for tasks can be set manually, or they can be set automatically, depending on task constraint and duration type. For more information, see&nbsp;the articles [Task Constraint overview](../../manage-work/tasks/task-constraints/task-constraint-overview.md)&nbsp;and&nbsp; [Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type](../../manage-work/tasks/taskdurtn/task-duration-and-duration-type.md)&nbsp;.

  Planned Dates for issues&nbsp;are manually set on issues by users. However, the system administrator can restrict users from adjusting Planned Dates for issues.

* Projected Dates for both tasks and issues are set&nbsp;automatically. For more information about the Projected Dates, see&nbsp;the articles [Overview of the Projected Completion Date for projects, tasks, and issues](../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-projected-completion-date.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When using Projected Dates on the scheduling timeline, user allocation information cannot be displayed. For more information about user allocations, see the article [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

To configure the scheduling timeline to display tasks and issues according to Projected Dates:&nbsp;

1. Go to the scheduling timeline for multiple projects, for an individual project, or for a team:

   * **For multiple projects**:&nbsp;  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, click **Resourcing > Workload Balancer**, then select **Scheduling** in the upper-left drop-down menu. 
   * **For an individual project**:  Go to a project, click the **Workload Balancer** section in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu. 
   * **For a team**:  Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click **Teams**, select a team, click **Workload Balancer** in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu.

1. Click the&nbsp;**Settings**&nbsp;icon on the scheduling timeline.  

1. On the Resource Scheduling Settings dialog box, disable&nbsp;the&nbsp;**Use Planned instead of Projected Dates**&nbsp;option.
1. Click **Return to Scheduling**.

## Configure how users are displayed on the scheduling timeline

>[!NOTE]
>
>This section applies only when scheduling resources for teams (from the  Scheduling section for a team ). When scheduling resources for multiple projects (from the Scheduling tab) or for a single project (from the Staffing tab), users cannot be displayed alphabetically; they are always organized by role.

When scheduling resources for a team, you can configure users to be displayed on the&nbsp;scheduling timeline either alphabetically or by role. By default, users are displayed alphabetically (roles are not displayed).

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click&nbsp;Teams. A team is selected by default. 

1. Click the **Settings** icon on the scheduling timeline.  

1. On the Settings dialog box,&nbsp;select&nbsp;whether to enable the **Group by Role** option.   
   When this option is disabled, users are displayed in alphabetical order, and roles are not shown on the scheduling timeline.  
   When this option is enabled, roles are displayed on the scheduling timeline, and users are grouped within their respective role. If a given user has multiple roles defined in the system, that user appears multiple times on the scheduling timeline, beneath each appropriate role.
