Using a filter in the Resource Scheduling area enables you to determine which work items are displayed on the scheduling timeline. This includes which tasks and issues are displayed in the Unassigned area, as well as which users are displayed.

Before you begin filtering content as described in this section, become familiar with how resource scheduling works in Adobe Workfront.  
For information about resource scheduling in Workfront, see the article [Get started with Resource Scheduling](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/get-started-resource-scheduling.md).  
For more information about the scheduling timeline, see the article [Get started with Resource Scheduling](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/get-started-resource-scheduling.md).

You can&nbsp;schedule resources or an individual team you are a member of or for any projects for which you are the Resource Manager.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td>

## Create a filter in the Schedule section (for Teams)

Tasks and issues from the projects, users, and roles you define in the filter are displayed on the scheduling timeline on the Working On tab. Use the options in the filter to determine which projects, users, and roles are represented on the scheduling timeline.

>[!NOTE]

>You cannot save a filter in the Working On Tab (for a team). When you refresh the page or navigate away from it, the filter reverts to the default settings.

To create a filter for the scheduling timeline on the Working On tab for teams:

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click **Teams**, select a team, click **Workload Balancer** in the left panel, then select **Scheduling** from the upper-left drop-down menu.  
1. Click **Filter**.
1. Determine which projects are represented in the Unassigned area by specifying the following information:

   <!--
   <p>(NOTE: Alina: there was a note that [This step is linked to from the context-sensitive help] but I could not find from where in the UI it is linked.)&nbsp;</p>
   -->

   * **Project Priorities:**&nbsp;Select the priority of the projects that you want to&nbsp;be represented on the scheduling timeline. Tasks and issues from projects with the priorities you select are&nbsp;displayed on the scheduling timeline.  
     Only priorities from projects that include tasks or issues that are assigned to the team are available to choose from this menu.
   * **Project Statuses:**&nbsp;Select the status of the projects that you want to be represented on the scheduling timeline. Tasks and issues from projects with the statuses&nbsp;you select are displayed&nbsp;on the scheduling timeline.

   -->

     Only tasks that are assigned to that role are displayed in the Unassigned area. Only users with the roles&nbsp;you select who are able to be assigned those tasks are displayed.  
     Users are displayed on the scheduling timeline, organized by job role.
   * **Users:**&nbsp;Select the individual users&nbsp;you want to be represented&nbsp;on the scheduling timeline.  
     Only the users you select are displayed, regardless of whether they have a role assignment that matches the role assignment of tasks in the Unassigned area.  
     This option does not affect which&nbsp;tasks and issues are displayed in the Unassigned area.

     <!--   
     <p>(NOTE: Alina: [! Users with Plan, Work, or Review licenses are available. Users with Request licenses are not available. - This is what it used to say. I think now instead you select specific users, not license types.])</p>   
     -->

1. (Optional) To make further modifications to the scheduling timeline (such as changing the date range), and to make modifications to user assignments, see the article [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).
