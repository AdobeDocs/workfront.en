As a resource manager, you can use the Workload Balancer to view and manage the workload of your users. For more general information about the Workload Balancer, see the following articles:

* [Overview of the Workload Balancer](../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/overview-workload-balancer.md) 
* [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md)

To efficiently find work items and to focus on the users you manage, we strongly recommend that you use filters in the Workload Balancer. This allows you to display the correct information before you start managing the assignments of your resources.

This article contains information about filters in the Workload Balancer. For information about filters in Workfront, see [Filters overview in Adobe Workfront](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/filters-overview.md).

## Overview of filters in the Workload Balancer

Consider the following when working with filters in the Workload Balancer:

* Depending on where you access the Workload Balancer from, Workfront might already be filtering the information for you.&nbsp;For information about pre-applied filters, see the section [Pre-applied filters in the Workload Balancer](#pre-applied-filters-in-the-workload-balancer) in this article. 
* You can create and apply a filter without saving it, or you can save a filter to reuse at a later time. 
* When you apply a filter without saving it, you can revert to the original lists by refreshing your page. 
* You can view filters you created or filters that other users created and shared with you. 
* When you delete or edit a shared filter, the filter is also deleted or edited for everyone with whom it is shared. 
* When you save and apply a new filter then navigate away from the Workload Balancer, the filter is preserved even after you log off and log back on. 
* When you create filters in the Workload Balancer in one area, they are not available in other areas. 

  **Example:** Filters created in the Resourcing area are not available in the Workload Balancer of a project or a team.

  For information about where to locate the Workload Balancer, see [Locate the Workload Balancer](../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/locate-workload-balancer.md).

* You can view only the items that match the selected filters that also match the dates within the timeline displayed on the screen of the Workload Balancer.

## Pre-applied filters in the Workload Balancer {#pre-applied-filters-in-the-workload-balancer}

The Workload Balancer displays information in two separate areas:

* **The Unassigned Work area**: work items that are not yet assigned to users. 
* **The Assigned Work area**: work items that are assigned to users.

  For information about what displays in each of the areas, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Each area of the Workload Balancer has its own set of filters which work independently from one another. You must configure both filters to indicate what information you want to see in each area.

Depending on where you access the Workload Balancer from, the Unassigned and Assigned areas are already filtered by certain criteria, as described in the following table:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront area where you access the Workload Balancer </td> 
   <td><b>Items that display in the Unassigned Work area by default</b> </td> 
   <td><b>Items that display in the Assigned Work area by default</b> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">The Resourcing area</td> 
   <td>No items display here by default. You must customize filters to view work items in this area.</td> 
   <td>Users who are members of any of your teams and their work items.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">A team</td> 
   <td>Work items that are assigned to the team or the team and a job role. </td> 
   <td> <p>Users who are members of the selected team and their work items that match the timeline selected on the screen.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">A project</td> 
   <td> <p>Unassigned work items or items assigned to teams or job roles in the selected project display in this area.</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Users that are assigned to at least one work item on the selected project and their work items on the selected project or on other projects that match the timeline selected on the screen.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&nbsp;

## Create Workload Balancer filters

The process for creating filters for the Unassigned Work and Assigned Work areas in the Workload Balancer is identical, regardless of where you access the Workload Balancer from. For information about locating the Workload Balancer, see [Locate the Workload Balancer](../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/locate-workload-balancer.md).

You can create a filter from scratch or edit one of the predefined filters. For information about existing filters that you can edit, see the [Edit an existing filter in the Workload Balancer](#edit-an-existing-filter-in-the-workload-balancer) section in this article.

1. Go to the Workload Balancer.

   For information about accessing the Workload Balancer, see [Navigate the Workload Balancer](../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/navigate-the-workload-balancer.md).

1. Click the **Filter** icon ![](assets/filter-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of either the **Unassigned Work** or the **Assigned Work** areas.

   The filter builder box displays on the right. The name of the area you create the filter for displays in the header of the box.

   ![](assets/filters-list-wb-assigned-work-with-filters-listed-nwe-350x377.png)

1. (Optional and conditional) If you access the Workload Balancer in the Resourcing area, the predefined Default filter might already be applied to the Assigned Work area. You can edit and save a copy of the Default filter.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The Default filter displays users that belong to any of your teams and their work items. You can edit a copy of this filter.

   1. Click **Manage** and disable either the **Share** or the **Delete** option. They are enabled by default.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Users cannot receive a higher permission than their access level. If they don't have access to Edit filters in their access level, they cannot receive permissions to manage a filter. Workfront disables the Manage option for these users and the option is dimmed.

1. Click **Share**. The filter is shared with the entities you specified.

   The filters you shared display in the **Shared with me** area of the filter box.
