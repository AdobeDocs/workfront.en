## Considerations for viewing items in the Workload Balancer

Consider the following when viewing the Workload Balancer:

* The Workload Balancer displays work items in two separate areas, depending on their assignments. Work items and users display in the following areas:

    * **Unassigned Work**: Items that have no assignments or are assigned only to job roles or teams.
    * **Assigned Work**: Items that are assigned to at least one user. The assigned items display under the assigned user's name. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >* Items assigned to a job role or a team which are also assigned to a user who is the primary assignee do not display in the Unassigned Work area.
    >
    >* Items assigned to a user and a job role where the job role is selected as the primary assignee of the item display in the Unassigned Work area. 
    >* Items assigned to more than one user display under all users' names in the Assigned Work area. 

* When a project has no tasks during a period of time, the bar at the 
project level becomes a dimmed color.  

  ![Break in project timeline](assets/wb-break-in-project-timeline-with-no-tasks-highlight-350x80.png)

* When you don't have permissions to see certain items, they display as **Inaccessible work items** or **Inaccessible projects**.

  ![Inaccessible items](assets/balancer-inaccessible-items-and-projects-highlighted-350x108.png)

* The names of the work items display on the left and their timeline displays on the right. 
* The total of Planned Hours for each work item displays to the right of the name of the work items and to the left of the bar that represents the work item's timeline. 
* The total of the Planned Hours for each project displays to the right of the name of the project and to the left of the bar that represents the project's timeline.

  The Planned Hours information for the project is a total of Planned Hours from all items listed in the Workload Balancer, and not a total of Planned Hours on the project.

## Navigate the Workload Balancer for multiple projects in the Resourcing area

Navigating the Workload Balancer is similar in all the areas where you access it from. 

The following subsections describe how to view the information in the Workload Balancer for multiple projects. 

You can adjust a number of settings and options in the Workload Balancer to display the information you need to focus on in the time frame that makes the most sense to you.

After selecting the settings you want to apply to your view, the Workload Balancer remembers these settings every time you access it from any browser or device.

### Access the Workload Balancer for multiple projects in the Resourcing area

To navigate the Workload Balancer for multiple projects: 

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![Main menu icon](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of Workfront, then click **Resourcing**.
1. Click **Workload Balancer** in the left panel.

    ![Workload Balancer](assets/nwe-balancer-global.png)
    
    The Workload Balancer displays work assignment information starting with the current week in the following two areas:

    * The **Unassigned Work** area displays the following work items:

        * Work items (tasks and issues) assigned to roles, teams, or that are unassigned display after you apply filters.
        The Unassigned Work area does not display any work items by default. We recommend using filters to display relevant information for you in this area.  
        
            For information about using filters, see [Filter information in the Workload Balancer](../workload-balancer/filter-information-workload-balancer.md).
        
        * Projects display only when you enable the Group by Project setting. For information see the section [Customize the view](#customize-the-view) in this article.

    * The **Assigned Work** area displays the following work items:
        
        * All active users in the system display in this area by default. We recommend using filters to limit the amount of information in this area. If users are assigned to items, the work items also display under their name. 
        
        * Tasks and issues assigned to at least one user display under the user's name.  

            The work items under the name of users in the Assigned Work area are sorted by the following criteria, in this order:

            1. Planned Start Date (oldest first)
            1. Planned Completion Date (oldest first)
            1. Alphabetical by project (only when the first two criteria are identical for multiple work items)

                >[!TIP]
                >
                >* You can customize the project sorting by selecting an option from the "Sort projects by" setting.  
                >
                >* Projects display only when you enable the "Group by Project" setting.
                > 
                >For information about customizing settings, see the section [Customize the view](#customize-the-view) in this article.               

1. (Optional) Click the **Filter** icon ![Filter icon](assets/filter-icon.png) in the **Assigned Work** area, then select the **Default filter** in the **Suggested** area of the filter box.  

    When applying the Default filter, users that belong to any of your teams and their work items display. You can edit a copy of this filter.
 
    >[!TIP]
    >
    >The Default filter is available only in the Workload Balancer in the Resourcing area.

1. Continue with the following steps to navigate the Workload Balancer: 

    * [Select a time frame in the Workload Balancer](#select-a-time-frame-in-the-workload-balancer)

1. Continue navigating the Workload Balancer as described in the following sections. 

### Customize the view

1. Access the Workload Balancer in the **Resourcing** area, as described in the section [Access the Workload Balancer for multiple projects in the Resourcing area](#access-the-workload-balancer-for-multiple-projects-in-the-resourcing-area) in this article. 

    The names of work items are listed on the left side and are represented by bars on the right side of the Workload Balancer. The length of the bar represents the timeline of a work item.

1. (Optional and recommended) Use filters in the Unassigned and Assigned Work areas to display only work items or users that are relevant to you. 

    For more information, see [Filter information in the Workload Balancer](../workload-balancer/filter-information-workload-balancer.md).

    By default, blue bars represent the timelines of projects and tasks and maroon bars represent issues.
    
    You can change the color of the bars for projects and tasks when you select your color theme to match the project. For more information, continue reading this procedure. 

    Work items in the Assigned Work area are sorted by projects by the following criteria, in this order:
    1. Planned Start Date (oldest first)
    1. Planned Completion Date (oldest first)
    1. Alphabetical by project (only when the first two criteria are identical for multiple work items). 

1. Click the **right-pointing arrow** to the left of the Unassigned or Assigned areas to expand all items under the project names (in the Unassigned area) and under the user names (in the Assigned area).

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >Work items are listed under project names in the Unassigned area only when you enable the "Group by Project" setting. 


1. Click the **down-pointing arrow** to the left of the Unassigned or Assigned areas to collapse all items under the project names (in the Unassigned area) and under the user names (in the Assigned area).

1. Drag and drop the **separation line** between the left panel and the timeline area to adjust the size of the left panel.

    ![Separation line between left panel and timeline](assets/separation-line-between-left-panel-and-timeline-highlighted-nwe-350x174.png)

1. Click the **Settings** icon ![Settings icon](assets/settings-gear-icon.png).

    The Settings panel displays on the right.

    ![Setting box options](assets/settings-box-options-global-with-color-theme-and-percentage-wb-nwe.png)

    Select from the options listed below to update the information you view in the Workload Balancer, then click the **X icon** in the upper-right of the Settings box to close it.

    * **Group by Project**: When this is selected, the items in the Unassigned and Assigned Work areas are grouped by project. This is selected by default.

    * **Include hours from issues**: When this is selected, issues assigned to users display under the user's name in the Assigned Work area and issues that are not assigned to users display in the Unassigned Work area. The Planned Hours from the issues count towards the Planned Hours for the project and for the user in the Assigned Work area.
    * **Show Projected Dates**: When this is selected, the projected timeline of work items displays in addition to the planned timeline. Notice the following:
        * The projected timeline of project, tasks, and issues displays as a dark blue line above the task, issue, and project bars.
        *  The projected timeline that is outside of the planned timeline displays in light blue, even when you update the color theme, as described below.
        * The projected timeline for the items that you have no access to view displays in light gray with a line underneath.
        * When a task or issue completes before the due Planned Completion Date the allocation numbers for the remaining days are struck through and do not count towards the user's allocation. This displays only when both the Show Projected Dates setting and the Show allocation icon are enabled.
        
        >[!TIP]
        >
        >Notice that work items display in the Workload Balancer when either their planned or the projected timelines (not necessarily both at the same time) occur during the time frame selected.

    * **Show completed work**: When this is enabled, tasks and issues that are completed display in the Assigned Work area. This is enabled by default. 
    
        A green checkmark icon displays to the upper-right corner of a task or issue bar when they are completed. The same icon displays for a project when the tasks or issues for the selected time frame of the project are completed.
    * **Show remaining time**: When this is enabled, Workfront displays the difference between the daily time for which the user is available to work based on their schedules and the hours for which they are allocated in the Assigned Work area for the users. This is disabled by default and allocated time displays by default.
    * In the **Select color theme** section, select the color that you want for the project and task bars.
            
        >[!TIP]
        >
        >The setting for selecting the color theme does not affect the color of the issue bars. Issues always display in a maroon-color bar. 

        Select from the following:
        * **Default**: The bars for all projects and their work items display in blue.
        * **Project**: The bars associated with each project and its tasks change according to the name of the project. All tasks that belong to the project display in bars that match the color of the project. The project bars display in a lighter shade to distinguish them from the tasks. The project bars also include a project icon when choosing not to display allocations.
        * **Project Status**: The bars associated with each project and its work items change to the color of the status of the project. 

            The project status is that associated with the Group of the project. If the Group does not have group-specific statuses, the color of the work item bars is that of the system-level project status. Both system as well as custom statuses display. For information about group statuses, see [Create or edit a group status](../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/create-or-edit-a-group-status.md).
    
    * In the **Display user allocation in** section, select from the following:
        * **Hours**: Displays allocated time as hours. This is the default.
        * **Percentage**: Displays allocated time as a percentage of the total available time
    * In the **Sorting preferences** section, select how you want the items to be sorted in the Workload Balancer. Select from the following options:
        * **Sort users by Primary Role**: Users display in the alphabetical order of their Primary Roles in the Assigned Work area.
        * **Sort users alphabetically**: Users display in the alphabetical order of their first names in the Assigned Work area.
        * **Sort projects by**: Select a project field from the drop-down menu to sort projects alphabetically by that field in the Unassigned or Assigned Work areas. 
 
    >[!TIP]
    >
    >You can sort by projects only when the Group by Project setting is enabled. Otherwise, this setting is dimmed.

1. (Optional and conditional) When you change the color theme to Project Status, hover over the name of a project on the left to view the status of the project.

    When this option is selected, only the items assigned to users on the selected project display. 
    
    When the option is unselected, all the items assigned to the users on the project display, regardless of what projects the items belong to.

1. (Optional and recommended) Apply a filter in the Assigned Work area to display users that are important to you but might not be assigned to items on the project, then click the **Show all users** icon ![Show all users](assets/show-all-users-icon-project-workload-balancer.png). 

    This displays other users in the system that are not yet assigned on the project. 
    
    For example, you might want to filter first for users that belong to your teams or groups, and then display all those users. 
    
    For information about how to build a filter, see [Filter information in the Workload Balancer](../workload-balancer/filter-information-workload-balancer.md).
