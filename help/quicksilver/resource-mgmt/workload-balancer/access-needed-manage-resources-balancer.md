# Access needed to manage resources in the Workload Balancer

Without correct access or permissions, you may not be able to view or manage your work assignments in the Workload Balancer.

You must have access to view the users whose workload you want to view or manage in the Workload Balancer. In addition to this, you must have the correct access level and the correct permissions on the projects the work is associated with.
