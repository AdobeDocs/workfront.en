## Unassign work items in the Workload Balancer

You can either unassign items from users and move them to the Unassigned Work area, or reassign them to other users.

To unassign work items from users:

1. In the Workload Balancer, go to the **Assigned Work** area and expand a user.
1. Do one of the following:

   * Find the item you want to unassign in a user's area, click it, and drag and drop it in the Unassigned area or in another user's area. 
   * Click the **More** icon ![](assets/more-icon-task-list.png) to the right of the name of a work item, click **Assign this to**, then remove the name of the entities assigned to the work item or enter another name, and click **Save**.

     ![](assets/assign-this-to-link-from-task-wb-nwe-350x104.png)

   The item displays in the Unassigned Work area if it matches the filtering criteria for that area and it is not assigned to any other users, or it displays in the user area if it is assigned to another user.

   For information about filtering information in the Workload Balancer, see [Filter information in the Workload Balancer](../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/filter-information-workload-balancer.md).
