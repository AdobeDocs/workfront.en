# Access Adobe Workfront objects from a shared link in Slack

When links to Adobe Workfront objects are shared with you in a Slack channel, you can view additional information about them in Slack, after you have installed and configured Workfront for Slack.

For more information about configuring Workfront with Slack, see [Configure Adobe Workfront for Slack](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-slack/configure-workfront-for-slack.md).

You must be logged in to Workfront in a separate browser tab to open the link or to perform additional actions on those objects from Slack.&nbsp;

When a user is sharing a link to an object in Workfront with you, additional information about the object might also be displayed along with the link. The user sending the link must have at least View permissions to the object in order for the additional information to display in Slack.&nbsp;

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality described in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
