After you have installed [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Slack], you can receive [!DNL Workfront] notifications in [!DNL Slack].\
For information about installing [!DNL Workfront for Slack], see [Configure [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Slack]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-slack/configure-workfront-for-slack.md).

You can enable a select number of [!UICONTROL notifications] that appear in the notifications bubble in the [!DNL Workfront] interface, to also be delivered in [!DNL Slack].

Email notifications work independently from [!DNL Workfront] interface notifications. You or your [!DNL Workfront] administrator can disable email notifications, whereas interface notifications cannot be disabled in [!DNL Workfront].\
You can, however, disable [!DNL Workfront] notifications that you might receive in [!DNL Slack], if you want to focus on those notifications only inside the [!DNL Workfront] interface. 

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans" target="_blank">[!DNL [!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan]</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
