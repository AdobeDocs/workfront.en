# Access [!DNL Adobe Workfront] from [!DNL Slack]

Integrating [!DNL Adobe Workfront] with [!DNL Slack] allows you to access [!DNL Workfront] from [!DNL Slack], or perform certain actions in [!DNL Workfront] using a slash command. The integration can be used from any [!DNL Slack] environment, including the [!DNL Slack] mobile app.

You or your [!DNL Slack] administrator must install the [!DNL Workfront] app in your [!DNL Slack] instance before you can use [!DNL Workfront] from [!DNL Slack].

## About slash commands {#about-slash-commands}

When using [!DNL Slack], you type messages inside of a message field. When you start your message with a slash, it becomes a command and it behaves differently than a simple message. The command tells [!DNL Slack] to perform an action.

You can access your [!DNL Workfront] instance from [!DNL Slack] by typing a slash command in any [!DNL Slack] channel.

Remember the following when using a slash command in [!DNL Slack] to access [!DNL Workfront]:

* Slash commands are case sensitive.
* The commands for [!DNL Workfront] are only visible to you, regardless of which channel you are typing them in.
* The command should always start with `/workfront` or `/wf`, followed by a space and the name of an action you want to perform in [!DNL Workfront].

   This indicates that your command is meant for the [!DNL Workfront] app. The commands for [!DNL Workfront] work only when you have already configured the [!DNL Workfront] app with your [!DNL Slack] instance.

For a list of all the commands you can run from Slack for [!DNL Workfront], see [Access [!DNL Workfront] from a slash command in [!DNL Slack]](#access-dnl-workfront-from-a-slash-command-in-dnl-slack-access-workfront-from-a-slash-command-in-slack).
