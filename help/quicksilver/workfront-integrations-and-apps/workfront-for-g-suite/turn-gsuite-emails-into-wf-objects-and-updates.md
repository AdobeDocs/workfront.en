# Turn G Suite emails into [!DNL Adobe Workfront] objects and updates

>[!NOTE]

>There is a [known issue](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/issues/new-workfront-experience/wf-current/wf-integrations-error-when-opening-wf-for-gsuite.html?lang=en) with the current version of [!DNL Workfront for G Suite] not working as expected. We are working on a new version and expect it to be released to the [!DNL Google Marketplace] in the near future. 

You can turn regular non-[!DNL Workfront] emails into [!DNL Adobe Workfront] objects and updates without leaving [!DNL G Mail]. For more information, see the following articles:
