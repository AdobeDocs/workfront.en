# Manage [!DNL Adobe Workfront] notification details from [!DNL Google Workspace]

>[!NOTE]
>
>The most recent version of the Adobe Workfront plugin for Google was released on June 26, 2023. 

In [!DNL Google Workspace], when you open a notification email [!DNL Adobe Workfront] has sent, you can view the associated work item details and respond without leaving your [!UICONTROL Inbox]. If actions are available, such as approving a request, you can perform those actions directly from [!DNL Workfront for Google Workspace].

>[!NOTE]

> [!DNL Workfront for Google Workspace] supports almost every type of email notification you can receive from [!DNL Workfront] (about 120 different types). [!UICONTROL Daily digest] emails sent from [!DNL Workfront] do not appear in [!DNL Workfront for Google Workspace]. For information about the [!DNL Workfront] email notification types, see [Modify your own email notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td>

</table>
