# Manage [!DNL Adobe Workfront] notification details from [!DNL G Suite]

>[!NOTE]
>
>There is a [known issue](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/issues/new-workfront-experience/wf-current/wf-integrations-error-when-opening-wf-for-gsuite.html?lang=en) with the current version of [!DNL Workfront for G Suite] not working as expected. We are working on a new version and expect it to be released to the [!DNL Google Marketplace] in the near future. 

In [!DNL G Suite], when you open a notification email [!DNL Adobe Workfront] has sent, you can view the associated work item details and respond without leaving your [!UICONTROL Inbox]. If actions are available, such as approving a request, you can perform those actions directly from [!DNL Workfront for G Suite].

>[!NOTE]
>
> [!DNL Workfront for G Suite] supports almost every type of email notification you can receive from [!DNL Workfront] (about 120 different types). [!UICONTROL Daily digest] emails sent from [!DNL Workfront] do not appear in [!DNL Workfront for G Suite]. For information about the [!DNL Workfront] email notification types, see [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Work], [!UICONTROL Plan]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you can manage notification details from [!DNL G Suite], you must

* Install [!DNL Workfront for G suite]\
   For instructions, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for G Suite]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/install-workfront-for-gsuite.md).

## Manage [!DNL Adobe Workfront] notification details from [!DNL G Suite]

1. If the [!DNL Workfront for G Suite] panel is not displayed, click the [!DNL Workfront] icon ![](assets/wf-lion-icon.png) in the [!DNL G Suite] add-ons sidebar at the far-right of the page.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL View all updates]** if it is displayed near the top of the panel.

   The options that might display relate to the type of email notification you have opened.
