# Create an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] issue in [!DNL G Suite] using email content

>[!NOTE]

>There is a [known issue](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/issues/new-workfront-experience/wf-current/wf-integrations-error-when-opening-wf-for-gsuite.html?lang=en) with the current version of [!DNL Workfront for G Suite] not working as expected.
