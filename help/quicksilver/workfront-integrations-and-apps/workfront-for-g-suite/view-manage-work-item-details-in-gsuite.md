# View and manage [!DNL Adobe Workfront] object details from [!DNL Google Workspace]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To deliver more stable and scalable integrations, we've shifted to a modern, flexible integration approach using Workfront Automation and Integration (Fusion). As part of this transition process, the following Workfront for Google Workspace functionality **is no longer available**: 
>
>* Accessing Google Workspace functionality from within Workfront 
>
>* Viewing and managing Workfront tasks from Gmail or the Google Calendar site panel 
>
>We recommend using Workfront Automation and Integration for your organization's integration needs with Google Workspace. 
>
>For an overview of Workfront Automation and Integration, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/get-started-with-fusion/understand-workfront-fusion/workfront-fusion-overview).

## Prerequisites

Before you can view and manage work item details in [!DNL Google Workspace], you must

* Install [!DNL Workfront for Google Workspace]\
   For instructions, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Google Workspace]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/install-workfront-for-gsuite.md).

## View and manage work item details in [!DNL Google Workspace]

1. If the [!UICONTROL Workfront for Google Workspace] panel is not displayed, click the [!DNL Workfront] icon ![Workfront icon](assets/wf-lion-icon.png) in the [!DNL Google Workspace] add-ons sidebar at the far-right of the page.
1. Go to the [!DNL Workfront] task or issue within [!DNL Google Workspace], as described in [Access [!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Home] content from [!DNL Google Workspace]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/access-wf-home-content-from-g-suite.md).

   When you select a task or issue, the **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab is open. The area above the **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab displays the name of the parent object, the name of the task or issue, and the [!UICONTROL Due date] (if it's a task) or [!UICONTROL Priority date] (if it's an issue).


   You can do various tasks on this tab without leaving [!DNL Google Workspace], including the following:

   * View the object's **[!UICONTROL Description]** and other details, such as the users assigned to the object, the **[!UICONTROL Priority]**, the requester, the **[!UICONTROL Planned completion date]**, and any custom fields and forms attached to the object.

      Custom forms display only fields where information has been added.

   * Click the **[!UICONTROL Parent project]** area to view the details of the parent object.

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >This can be helpful when you have tasks and issues with the same name and you need to differentiate them.

   * Accept work assigned to you by clicking **[!UICONTROL Work on it]**.
   * Edit various options, such as **[!UICONTROL Done]** option, the **[!UICONTROL Status]**, and the **[!UICONTROL Percent complete]**.

      Under **[!UICONTROL Percent complete]**, type numbers and (optionally) the percentage sign % to indicate your progress on an item.
   * View information about an approval request, including the owner, size, and any attachments.
   * **[!UICONTROL Approve]** or **[!UICONTROL Reject]** approval requests and documents.

   * **[!UICONTROL Grant]** or **[!UICONTROL Ignore]** access requests.

1. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL View in [!DNL Workfront]]** to go to the current work item in [!DNL Workfront].

* For information about using the [!UICONTROL Updates] tab in [!DNL Workfront for Google Workspace], see [Update an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] object from [!DNL Google Workspace]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/update-a-workfront-object-in-gsuite.md).
* For information about using the [!UICONTROL Documents] tab in [!DNL Workfront for Google Workspace], see [View and manage documents from [!DNL G Suite]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/view-and-manage-documents-in-gsuite.md).
