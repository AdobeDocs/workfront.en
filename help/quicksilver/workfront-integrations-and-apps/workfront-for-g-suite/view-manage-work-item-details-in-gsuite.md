You can view and manage the details of a work item without leaving [!DNL Google Workspace]. For example, you can read a task's description, view its parent object, change its status, and mark it as complete, all within [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Google Workspace].

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Work], [!UICONTROL Plan]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
</tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you can view and manage work item details in [!DNL Google Workspace], you must

* Install [!DNL Workfront for Google Workspace]\
   For instructions, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Google Workspace]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/install-workfront-for-gsuite.md).

## View and manage work item details in [!DNL Google Workspace]

1. If the [!UICONTROL Workfront for Google Workspace] panel is not displayed, click the [!DNL Workfront] icon ![](assets/wf-lion-icon.png) in the [!DNL Google Workspace] add-ons sidebar at the far-right of the page.
1. Go to the [!DNL Workfront] task or issue within [!DNL Google Workspace], as described in [Access [!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Home] content from [!DNL Google Workspace]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/access-wf-home-content-from-g-suite.md).

   When you select a task or issue, the **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab is open. The area above the **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab displays the name of the parent object, the name of the task or issue, and the [!UICONTROL Due date] (if it's a task) or [!UICONTROL Priority date] (if it's an issue).


   You can do various tasks on this tab without leaving [!DNL Google Workspace], including the following:

   * View the object's **[!UICONTROL Description]** and other details, such as the users assigned to the object, the **[!UICONTROL Priority]**, the requester, the **[!UICONTROL Planned completion date]**, and any custom fields and forms attached to the object.

      Custom forms display only fields where information has been added.

   * Click the **[!UICONTROL Parent project]** area to view the details of the parent object.

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >This can be helpful when you have tasks and issues with the same name and you need to differentiate them.

   * Accept work assigned to you by clicking **[!UICONTROL Work on it]**.
   * Edit various options, such as **[!UICONTROL Done]** option, the **[!UICONTROL Status]**, and the **[!UICONTROL Percent complete]**.

      Under **[!UICONTROL Percent complete]**, type numbers and (optionally) the percentage sign % to indicate your progress on an item.
   * View information about an approval request, including the owner, size, and any attachments.
   * **[!UICONTROL Approve]** or **[!UICONTROL Reject]** approval requests and documents.

   * **[!UICONTROL Grant]** or **[!UICONTROL Ignore]** access requests.

1. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL View in [!DNL Workfront]]** to go to the current work item in [!DNL Workfront].
