</table>

## Prerequisites

Before you can view and manage work item details in [!DNL G Suite], you must

* Install [!DNL Workfront for G suite]\
   For instructions, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for G Suite]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/install-workfront-for-gsuite.md).

## View and manage work item details in [!DNL G Suite]

1. If the [!UICONTROL Workfront for G Suite] panel is not displayed, click the [!DNL Workfront] icon ![](assets/wf-lion-icon.png) in the [!DNL G Suite] add-ons sidebar at the far-right of the page.
1. Go to the [!DNL Workfront] task or issue within [!DNL G Suite], as described in [Access [!DNL Adobe Workfront] [!UICONTROL Home] content from [!DNL G Suite]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/access-wf-home-content-from-g-suite.md).

   When you select a task or issue, the **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab is open. The area above the **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab displays the name of the parent object, the name of the task or issue, and the [!UICONTROL Due date] (if it's a task) or [!UICONTROL Priority date] (if it's an issue).


   You can do various tasks on this tab without leaving [!DNL G Suite], including the following:

   * View the object's **[!UICONTROL Description]** and other details, such as the users assigned to the object, the **[!UICONTROL Priority]**, the requester, the **[!UICONTROL Planned completion date]**, and any custom fields and forms attached to the object.

      Custom forms display only fields where information has been added.

   * Click the **[!UICONTROL Parent project]** area to view the details of the parent object.
