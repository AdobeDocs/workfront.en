## Use Workfront proof templates to define approval workflows

If your organization's content review process is often repeated or is reviewed by the same people, you can use proof templates to automate review and approval workflows. 

You can create simple, single-stage templates for just one or two reviewers, or you can create automated, multi-stage templates for complex reviews with many stages and dependencies.

When a user initiates a review in GenStudio, they simply choose the template they need. Users can easily change any proof workflow template, adding or removing reviewers and stages, at any time. 

With proof workflow templates, you can 

* Add specific users and assign each a designated proof role
* Set a deadline
* Choose when a stage activates 
* Lock stages after they complete
* Require only one decision
* Specify a primary decision maker
* and more

For more information, about automated workflows and templates see 

* [Automated Workflow overview](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/automated-workflow.md)
* [Create and manage Automated Workflow templates](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/create-manage-automated-workflow-templates.md)

## Review GenStudio draft content in the proofing viewer

You can review GenStudio draft content in the proofing viewer. 

For more information about review and approval in GenStudio, see [link to GS docs]().

## See review decisions in GenStudio for final approval and publishing
