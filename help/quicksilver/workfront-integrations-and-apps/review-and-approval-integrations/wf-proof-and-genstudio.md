## Use Workfront proof templates to define approval workflows

If your organization's content review process is often repeated or is reviewed by the same people, you can use proof templates to automate review and approval workflows. 

You can create simple, single-stage templates for just one or two reviewers, or you can create automated, multi-stage templates for complex reviews with many stages and dependencies.

When a user initiates a review in GenStudio, they simply choose the template they need. Users can easily change any proof workflow template, adding or removing reviewers and stages, at any time. 

With proof workflow templates, you can 

* Add specific users and assign each a designated proof role
* Set a deadline
* Choose when a stage activates 
* Lock stages after they complete
* Require only one decision
* Specify a primary decision maker
* and more

For more information, about automated workflows and templates see 

* [Automated Workflow overview](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/automated-workflow.md)
* [Create and manage Automated Workflow templates](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/create-manage-automated-workflow-templates.md)

## Review and approve GenStudio draft content in the proofing viewer

You can review and approve GenStudio draft content directly in GenStudio in the proofing viewer. 

With the proofing viewer, you can 

* Leave comments
* Mark-up draft to show what needs to change 
* Make a decision

For more information about review and approval in GenStudio, see <!--[Workfront Proof integration with GenStudio for Performance Marketing]().-->

## View review decisions in GenStudio for final approval and publishing

Once the asset has gone through the review and approval process, you can view the review decision and publish the content directly from GenStudio.
