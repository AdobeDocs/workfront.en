* Files cannot be published without formal approval, ensuring compliance  

* Requester must submit remixed files for approval, which will initiate the pre-configured approval workflow  

* Requester can see status of review in Express and monitor the progress in real time  

* Approvers can use the Workfront Proof viewer for deep reviews using drawing markups, annotations and commenting  

* Enterprise grade compliance through electronic signatures and full audit logs
