## Integration requirements

* The integration must be enabled for your accounts by the Adobe Product Team.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >The Adobe Express and Workfront Proof integration will be available to users over the course of several releases, starting with accounts that have Workfront and Adobe Express associated with the same Organization ID in the Adobe Admin Console, followed by customers with users working across IMS orgs. If you would like to have the integration enabled, please reach out to your Customer Success or Strategic Account Manager. 

* Users must install the [Review interactive content with the Adobe Workfront review tool](/help/quicksilver/review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/review-proof-in-web-viewer-extension.md) before they can start reviewing drafts in Adobe Express.


## Set up approval workflows in Workfront

Before users can add an approval workflow on an Express template, a Proof administrator with a Standard license must create an approval workflow in Workfront.

For more information, see [Create and manage Automated Workflow templates](/help/quicksilver/administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/create-manage-automated-workflow-templates.md).

## Add an approval workflow to an Express templates

After an approval workflow template is created in Workfront, designers with an Express Enterprise premium license can assign it to an Express template directly within Adobe Express. 

 When a Express template is remixed, an approval will be required before publishing--automatically triggering the pre-configured approval workflow. 
 
Users must have a Standard Workfront license to request approval from Adobe Express.
