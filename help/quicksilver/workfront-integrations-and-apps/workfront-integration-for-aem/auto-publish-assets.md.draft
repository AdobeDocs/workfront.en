  For instructions, see [Workfront Tools for AEM User Guide: Installation Guide 1.x.x](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-integration-for-aem/installation-guide.md)

## Auto Publish Assets

* Automatically publish assets when sent from Adobe Workfront

   * This option will enable automatic publishing of assets when they are sent from Workfront to AEM. This feature can be enabled conditionally by specifying a Workfront custom form field  and the value it should be set to. Whenever a document is sent to AEM, if it satisfies the condition, then the asset will be automatically published.

* Publish all project assets to Brand Portal upon project completion:

   * This option will enable automatic publishing of assets to Brand Portal when the status of the Workfront project they belong to is changed to Complete.
