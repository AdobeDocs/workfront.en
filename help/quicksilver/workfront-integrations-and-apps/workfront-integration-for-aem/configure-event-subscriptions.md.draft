# ```Workfront Tools for AEM User Guide : Configure Event Subscriptions```  {#title-heading}

Event subscriptions are used to notify AEM of events that take place in Adobe Workfront. There are three Workfront Tools features that need event subscriptions in order to work, these are:

* Automatic creation of project linked folders.
* Synchronization of changes in Workfront document custom form values to AEM asset metadata.
* Automatic publication of assets to Brand Portal upon project completion.

If you plan to use either of these three features, then you should enable Event subscriptions.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> <!--
   <tr data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> 
    <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
    <td> <p>Review or higher</p> </td> 
   </tr>
  --> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>You must have a license to Adobe Experience Manager</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites
