# ```Workfront Tools for AEM User Guide : Assign Issues & Tasks```  {#title-heading}

This workflow step will allow a user to assign objects in Adobe Workfront. This workflow step can be added to any workflow model. The Workfront artifact this step affects will be looked up using a relative path from the payload.

Each workflow step can be added to any new or existing AEM Workflow Model. Workflow models can be conditionally triggered using AEMâ€™s Workflow Launchers. See additional information on [Administering AEM Workflows](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/workflows.html) and [AEM Launchers](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/workflows-starting.html).
