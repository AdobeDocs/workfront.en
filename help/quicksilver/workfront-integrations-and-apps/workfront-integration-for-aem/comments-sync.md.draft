1. Select the ```Event Subscriptions``` tab. Under the ```Create a new event subscription``` menu, select ```create``` from the Event dropdown and under the Object dropdown select ```note```. This we create a workflow step that listens for comments added to Workfront linked documents and add the comment in AEM.
