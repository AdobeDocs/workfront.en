## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td>

    <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
   </tr>
  --> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>You must have a license to Adobe Experience Manager</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

* You must install Workfront Tools for Adobe Experience Manager before you can use it.

  For instructions, see [Workfront Tools for AEM User Guide: Installation Guide 1.x.x](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-integration-for-aem/installation-guide.md)

## Advanced Settings for Versioning {#versioning-advancedsettingsforversioning}

* Store assets with the same name as versions of the existing asset:

   * When checked, this option will enable storing assets uploaded with the same name and to the same location as the version of the existing asset. If left unchecked, a new asset will be created with a different name (e.g. asset-name.pdf and asset-name-1.pdf)

* Update asset metadata when creating a new version:

   * When checked, this option will update the asset metadata whenever a new version of the asset is created. If unchecked, the asset will keep the metadata it had prior to creating the new version.

When an asset has been sent from Workfront to AEM the version history of the asset will be managed in AEM. See [Managing AEM Assets](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/assets/managing/managing-assets-touch-ui.html#timeline) for more information.

## Current Limitations of Versioning {#versioning-currentlimitationsofversioning}

* Workfront document versioning is currently unsupported within linked folders.

   * When creating a Workfront Proof with a document inside a linked folder you will lose your previous version's comments and annotations.
