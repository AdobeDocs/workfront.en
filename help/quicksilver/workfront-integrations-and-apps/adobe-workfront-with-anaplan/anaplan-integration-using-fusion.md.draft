# Integrate with [!DNL Anaplan] using Adobe Workfront Fusion

<!--
<p style="color: #ff0000;" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Do not undraft</p>
-->

Adobe Workfront Fusion allows you to integrate Workfront with your [!DNL Anaplan] account. For example, you can create campaigns in Anaplan, then create a Workfront project or program linked to the campaign. Any costs tracked in Workfront can then be uploaded back to [!DNL Anaplan] to review campaign performance.

Campaign in this article refers to the [!DNL Anaplan] object. Campaigns in [!DNL Anaplan] are in no way related to the Campaign object in Workfront, nor are they related to the Fusion connector for Adobe Campaign.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:
