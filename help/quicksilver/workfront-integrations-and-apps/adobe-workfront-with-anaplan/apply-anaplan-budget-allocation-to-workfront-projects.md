# Apply an [!DNL Anaplan] budget allocation to an [!DNL Adobe Workfront] project

This integration scenario syncs any budget allocations that have been made in [!DNL Anaplan] back to [!DNL Workfront]. The scenario pulls all linked campaign budget items, then passes the budged value to the linked [!DNL Workfront] project if the budget value has been changed.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan, Work</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] license**</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Workfront Fusion for Work Automation and Integration] </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>Your organization must purchase [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] as well as [!DNL Adobe Workfront] to use functionality described in this article.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

&#42;&#42;For information on [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses, see [[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] licenses](../../workfront-fusion/get-started/license-automation-vs-integration.md)

## Triggering Event

This scenario is scheduled to execute every 15 minutes.

## Expected [!DNL Workfront] Configuration

You must have the following in [!DNL Workfront] to use this scenario:

* A user profile in [!DNL Workfront] named **Anaplan Integration**, that has system administrator rights.

   For information on creating a user in [!DNL Workfront], see [Add users](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/add-users.md).

## Expected [!DNL Anaplan] Configuration

You must have the following in [!DNL Anaplan] to use this scenario:

* A user profile in [!DNL Anaplan] named **[!DNL Workfront] Integration**, that has system administrator rights.
* The [!DNL Anaplan] Model that you want to use for this scenario.
* The List within the [!DNL Anaplan] Model that captures campaign budgets.

   The list's module must support receiving the following attributes:

   * [!UICONTROL Workfront Project GUID]
   * [!UICONTROL Campaign Name]
   * [!UICONTROL Requested Labor Funds]
   * [!UICONTROL Estimated Revenue]
   * [!UICONTROL Brand]

   This list and module must store additional details that are necessary for the normal functionality of [!DNL Anaplan], including the ability to set a budget and communicate that the budget list item is ready to be synced back to [!DNL Workfront].

* A view in [!DNL Anaplan] named **[!UICONTROL Campaigns.Update Campaigns in Adobe Workfront]**.

   This view must contain the following columns, in this order:

   1. [!UICONTROL Item Name]

   2. [!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront] Project GUID]

   3. [!UICONTROL Campaign Name]

   4. [!UICONTROL Budget]

   5. [!UICONTROL Estimated Revenue]

   6. [!UICONTROL Brand]

   The view should be filtered to display items that have a [!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront] Project GUID] and some indicator that budget allocations should be transmitted to [!DNL Workfront].

For instructions on any of these actions, see the [!DNL Anaplan] documentation.

## Deploying to [!DNL Workfront Fusion]
