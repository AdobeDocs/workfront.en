# [!DNL Adobe Workfront] with [!DNL Anaplan]

Adobe [!DNL Workfront Fusion] allows you to integrate [!DNL Workfront] with your [!DNL Anaplan] account. For example, you can create campaigns in [!DNL Anaplan], then create a [!DNL Workfront] project or program linked to the campaign. Any costs tracked in [!DNL Workfront] can then be uploaded back to [!DNL Anaplan] to review campaign performance.

For this integration, you must configure certain objects in both [!DNL Anaplan] and Workfront. The specific objects and configuration depend on the specific workflow. Then, you configure a Workfront Fusion template with the [!DNL Anaplan] and [!DNL Workfront] objects and fields. [!DNL Workfront Fusion] then automates the integration based on your configurations.
