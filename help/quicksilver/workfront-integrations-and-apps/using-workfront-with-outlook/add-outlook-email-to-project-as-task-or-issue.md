# Add an [!DNL Outlook] email to a project as a task or an issue


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[Microsoft has disabled support for legacy Exchange online tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens), which were used by the Workfront Outlook add-in for authentication. This change by Microsoft rolled out in phases and is complete as of October 1, 2025.
>
>**Because Microsoft has disabled these tokens, the Workfront for Microsoft Outlook integration no longer functions.** 

You can convert emails to [!DNL Adobe Workfront] tasks or issues. After an email is converted, the task or issue appears on the project that is selected as you are converting it. 

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto">

   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Work], [!UICONTROL Plan]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
