title: Permissions levels for [!DNL Workfront] for Outlook
description: The [!DNL Workfront for Outlook] add-in requires Read/write mailbox access. The [!DNL Workfront for Outlook] integration requires the highest level permissions because it has the functionality to download email attachments from the Outlook exchange server and upload them to [!DNL Workfront], when the user submits a Request from an email that has attachments.

# Permissions levels for [!DNL Workfront for Outlook]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[Microsoft has disabled support for legacy Exchange online tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens), which were used by the Workfront Outlook add-in for authentication. This change by Microsoft rolled out in phases and is complete as of October 1, 2025.
>
>**Because Microsoft has disabled these tokens, the Workfront for Microsoft Outlook integration no longer functions.**
