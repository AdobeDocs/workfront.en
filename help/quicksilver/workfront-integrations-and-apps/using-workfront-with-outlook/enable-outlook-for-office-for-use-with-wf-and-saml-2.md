# Enable [!DNL Outlook for Office] for use with [!DNL Adobe Workfront] and SAML 2.0



>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[Microsoft has disabled support for legacy Exchange online tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens), which were used by the Workfront Outlook add-in for authentication. This change by Microsoft rolled out in phases and is complete as of October 1, 2025.
>
>**Because Microsoft has disabled these tokens, the Workfront for Microsoft Outlook integration no longer functions.** 

If your [!DNL Adobe Workfront] system is integrated with SAML 2.0, you must enable SAML 2.0 authentication for [!DNL Office] add-ins in order for users to be able to authenticate using their SAML 2.0 credentials. 

If you experience issues when logging in to [!DNL Workfront] with SAML, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator to ensure that SAML is configured correctly.

For information about how to enable Office add-ins to authenticate using a SAML 2.0 solution, see the section in the [Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 2.0](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/configure-workfront-saml-2.md) article.
