If your [!DNL Adobe Workfront] system is integrated with SAML 2.0, you must enable SAML 2.0 authentication for [!DNL Office] add-ins in order for users to be able to authenticate using their SAML 2.0 credentials. 

If you experience issues when logging in to [!DNL Workfront] with SAML, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator to ensure that SAML is configured correctly.

For information about how to enable Office add-ins to authenticate using a SAML 2.0 solution, see the section in the [Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 2.0](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/configure-workfront-saml-2.md) article.
