>[Microsoft has disabled support for legacy Exchange online tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens), which were used by the Workfront Outlook add-in for authentication. This change by Microsoft rolled out in phases and is complete as of October 1, 2025.
