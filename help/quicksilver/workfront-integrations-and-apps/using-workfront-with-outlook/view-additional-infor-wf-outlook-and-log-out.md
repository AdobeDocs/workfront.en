# View additional information about [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Outlook] and log out

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[Microsoft is in the process of disabling support for legacy Exchange online tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens), which are currently used by the Workfront Outlook add-in for authentication. This change by Microsoft has already started affecting customers and will continue to roll out in phases through October 2025.
>
>* **After Microsoft fully disables these tokens, the Workfront for Microsoft Outlook integration will no longer function.** 
>
>As part of this change, Microsoft has made the decision to change the way tokens are re-enabled. After **June 30, 2025**, admins will no longer be able to re-enable tokens themselvesâ€”only Microsoft Support can grant exceptions. **On October 1, 2025, legacy tokens will be turned off for all tenants. Exceptions will not be granted.**
