   You can update the following information from the email before it is saved as a task:

   * **Type**: Select the type of object you are updating. You can select **Project**, **Task**, or **Issue**. The object you select determines the results that display in the **Name** field below. If you are unsure of the type of object, select **All** to search for projects, tasks, and issues simultaneously.
   
   * **Name**: Begin&nbsp;typing the name of the project, task, or issue that you want to update. Click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.
   * **Update**: By default, the update is the same as the email Body. You can modify the update as desired.  
     This update is displayed as the update status in Workfront.
   
   * **Attachments**: Any email attachments are saved to the Documents area of the task. You can delete any attachments before submitting the update.

1. (Optional) Click&nbsp;**Include Others**, begin typing the name of users who you want to include in the update, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.   
   Repeat this process to include additional users, then click **Done**.  
   By default, the user you are replying to receives a notification regardless of whether you include them.
