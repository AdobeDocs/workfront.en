## Prerequisites

{{cc-install-prereq}}

## Use the [!UICONTROL Work List] to access important information

The [!UICONTROL Work List] allows you to view all of the tasks and issues assigned to you in one place. You can use the [!UICONTROL Sort by] option to group items together and then use the [!UICONTROL Filter] to focus in on work that needs to be completed.

### Group similar work items together with the [!DNL Sort By] option

Use the [!UICONTROL Sort by] option to group similar items in the [!UICONTROL Work List]. You can sort by:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>[!UICONTROL Due Date]</li> 
     <li>[!UICONTROL Name]</li> 
     <li>[!UICONTROL Project Name]</li> 
     <li>[!UICONTROL My Priority]</li> 
    </ul> </td> 
   <td> <img src="assets/copy-of-sort-by-350x606.png" style="width: 350;height: 606;"> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

### Narrow your focus with filters

Use the [!UICONTROL Filter] to narrow your focus to specific work items. There are a couple of ways to use the filter:

&nbsp;

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <p>The first is filtering based solely on work item type or attributes:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>Work item</strong>: Tasks, Subtasks, Issues, or Personal tasks</li> 
     <li><strong>Work item state</strong>: [!UICONTROL Working On], [!UICONTROL Ready to Start], or [!UICONTROL Not Ready]</li> 
    </ul> <p>The second is filtering using work item and work item state together. For example, you can select Tasks and [!UICONTROL Ready to Start] to find all of the tasks in your work list that are ready for work.</p> <p>You can also use [!UICONTROL Field Match] to search for a specific item within your filter set. </p> </td> 
   <td> <img src="assets/copy-of-filter-p-350x603.png" style="width: 350;height: 603;"> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Search for your work

Use the [!UICONTROL Search] bar to locate projects, tasks, issues, and documents you need. 

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>See recent items: You can view up to 5 of your most recent work items accessed through either the desktop or plugin versions of Workfront.</li> 
     <li>Locate pinned items: You can access projects, tasks, issues, and documents you've pinned in the new Adobe Workfront experience.</li> 
     <li>Find your favorites: You can see any project, task, issue, or document you saved as a favorite.</li> 
    </ul> </td> 
   <td> <img src="assets/copy-of-search-p.png"> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Use the [!UICONTROL Menu] to navigate projects

You can use the [!UICONTROL Menu] icon to navigate to parent items in a project.
