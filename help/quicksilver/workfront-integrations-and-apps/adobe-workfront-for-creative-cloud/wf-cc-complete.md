1. From the **[!UICONTROL Work List]**, select the task or issue you wish to mark complete. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.  If you are the only user assigned to this task or issue, this marks the item [!UICONTROL Complete] or [!UICONTROL Resolved] in [!DNL Workfront].
1. (Conditional) If multiple users are assigned to this task or issue, clicking [!UICONTROL Done] opens a dropdown. You can then:

   Click **[!UICONTROL Done with my part]** if other users must also do their work for the task or issue to be complete.

   Or

   Click **[!UICONTROL Complete]** (for tasks) or **[!UICONTROL Resolved]** (for issues) if no further work needs to be done on the task or issue. This marks the item [!UICONTROL Complete] or [!UICONTROL Resolved] in [!DNL Workfront].  

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the work item has predecessors, the Done button is gray until those predecessors are marked complete. To view predecessors inside of [!DNL Workfront], click on the task name.
