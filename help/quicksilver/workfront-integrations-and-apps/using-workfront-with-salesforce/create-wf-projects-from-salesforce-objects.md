# Create [!DNL Adobe Workfront] projects from [!DNL Salesforce] objects

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To deliver more stable and scalable integrations, we're shifting to a modern, flexible integration approach using Workfront Automation and Integration (Fusion). As part of this transition process, the Workfront for Salesforce integration will not be available after **February 28, 2026**. 
>
>We recommend using Workfront Automation and Integration for your organization's integration needs with Google Workspace. 
>
>For an overview of Workfront Automation and Integration, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/get-started-with-fusion/understand-workfront-fusion/workfront-fusion-overview).

>For information about the specific capabilities of the Workfront Automation and Integration modules for Salesforce, see [Salesforce modules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/references/apps-and-their-modules/third-party-app-connectors/salesforce-modules). 

After installing [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for Salesforce, you can define triggers that create [!DNL Workfront] projects when certain criteria are met on [!DNL Salesforce] [!UICONTROL Opportunities] and [!UICONTROL Accounts].

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality described in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

To submit a [!DNL Workfront] request from a [!DNL Salesforce] [!UICONTROL Opportunity] or Account
 ensure that you have the following in your environment:

* Your [!DNL Workfront] administrator has installed [!DNL Workfront for Salesforce].\
   For more information about installing [!DNL Workfront for Salesforce], see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Salesforce]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/install-workfront-for-salesforce.md)

* Your [!DNL Workfront] administrator has added the [!DNL Workfront] section to your [!UICONTROL Opportunity] and Account
 page layouts.\
   For more information about adding the [!DNL Workfront] section to a page layout, see [Configure the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] section for [!DNL Salesforce] users](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/configure-wf-section-for-salesforce-users.md).

* You have a [!DNL Workfront] account and you can log in to it from the [!DNL Workfront] section inside your [!UICONTROL Opportunity] or Account
.

## Configuring the Creation of [!DNL Workfront] Projects from [!DNL Salesforce]

* [Understanding the Automatic Creation of Projects](#understanding-the-automatic-creation-of-projects-understanding-the-automatic-creation-of-projects)
* [Configuring Triggers](#configuring-triggers-configuring-triggers)
* [Understanding Project Names](#understanding-project-names-understanding-project-names)

### Understanding the Automatic Creation of Projects {#understanding-the-automatic-creation-of-projects}

As the [!DNL Salesforce] system administrator, you can define triggers that can automatically create projects in [!DNL Workfront] when the following things happen in [!DNL Salesforce]:

* The [!UICONTROL Stage] of an [!UICONTROL Opportunity] is updated.
* The [!UICONTROL Type] of an Account
 is updated.  

Triggers can be configured only after you have installed [!DNL Workfront for Salesforce].  \
For information about installing [!DNL Workfront for Salesforce], see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Salesforce]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/install-workfront-for-salesforce.md).

Consider the following when configuring triggers to automatically create [!DNL Workfront] projects when [!DNL Salesforce] items are created or updated:

* You must be a [!DNL Salesforce] and a [!DNL Workfront] system administrator to configure triggers. 
* After you configure the triggers, anyone who updates the [!UICONTROL Stage] of an [!UICONTROL Opportunity] or the [!UICONTROL Type] of an Account
 can trigger the creation of a [!DNL Workfront] project. This includes [!DNL Salesforce] users who do not have a [!DNL Workfront] account. 
* There is no limit to how many triggers you can have.
* You cannot create multiple triggers based on the same conditions. Triggers are unique by default.
* Once the project is created it is automatically linked to the opportunity or the account where it was generated. Once established, this link cannot be broken.
* One opportunity or account can be linked to multiple projects in [!DNL Workfront] when a triggered condition has been met multiple times in the life of the opportunity or the account.

   For example, if you define more then one [!UICONTROL Stage] for an [!UICONTROL Opportunity] to trigger a Project, a project is created for every defined stage that the opportunity reaches, for the life of that opportunity. Also, if you update the [!UICONTROL Stage] of an [!UICONTROL Opportunity] from one defined stage to another, and then update it back to the defined stage, a second project is created for the second time you update the [!UICONTROL Stage] field to the same defined stage. 

* One project in [!DNL Workfront] can be linked only to one opportunity or one account in [!DNL Salesforce] at any given time, but not to both at the same time. 

### Configuring Triggers {#configuring-triggers}

Once you configure the triggers, the process of creating [!DNL Workfront] projects is enabled for both [!UICONTROL Salesforce Classic] or [!DNL Lightning Experience] frameworks.

To configure triggers in [!UICONTROL Salesforce]:

1. Log in to [!DNL Salesforce] as the system administrator. 
1. (Conditional) In [!DNL Salesforce Classic], click **[!UICONTROL Setup]**, and under the **[!UICONTROL Build]** section, expand **[!UICONTROL Lightning Bolt]**.

   Or

   In [!DNL Salesforce] Lightning Experience, click the **[!UICONTROL Setup] icon**, then **[!UICONTROL Setup]**, and under **[!UICONTROL PLATFORM TOOLS]** expand **[!UICONTROL Apps]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Installed Packages]**.

   Notice that the **[!DNL Workfront]** package has been installed.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Configure]** next to **[!DNL Workfront]**.

1. Log in to [!DNL Workfront] as a system administrator.

   The **[!UICONTROL Triggers]** page displays.

   ![salesforce_triggers_page_empty.png](assets/salesforce-triggers-page-empty-350x134.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL New Trigger]**. 
1. From the **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Salesforce] Object]** drop-down menu, select **[!UICONTROL Opportunity]**.

   This is a required field.

1. (Conditional) Specify the following:

   1. From the **[!UICONTROL Stage]** drop-down menu, select a **[!UICONTROL Stage]**.\

      When an opportunity reaches the [!UICONTROL Stage] specified here, a project is created in [!DNL Workfront]. This is a required field.

   1. In the **[!UICONTROL Portfolio or Program]** field, start typing the name of a Portfolio or Program where you want the project to be placed in [!DNL Workfront], then select it when it appears in the list.\

      If you do not specify a Portfolio or a Program, the new project is created and added to the [!UICONTROL Projects I Own] list of the user logged in to [!DNL Workfront] when configuring the triggers. That user is also the Project Owner for the new project.

   1. Start typing the name of a Template that you want to associate with the new [!DNL Workfront] project, then select it when it appears in the list.\

      This is a required field. 


      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If you have specified a Template Owner on the template that you are planning to use for this integration, that becomes the Project Owner of the new project. The new projects appear under the [!UICONTROL Projects I Own] list of the user who is the owner of the new project, according to the template.

   1. (Optional) Select the **[!UICONTROL Create a new project for each sold product type] field**, if you want to create a new project for every type of product that is sold under any one opportunity. 
   1. (Conditional) Select a **[!UICONTROL Product]** in the **[!UICONTROL Product]** drop-down menu.

      This is a required field.

   1. (Conditional) Start typing the name of a **[!UICONTROL Template]** that you want to associate with the new [!DNL Workfront] project if the specified Product is on the [!UICONTROL Opportunity]. Select it when it appears in the list.

      This is a required field.

      The project created when a new product is added to the [!DNL Salesforce] opportunity is placed in the same Portfolio or Program selected for the opportunity.

      >[!IMPORTANT]
      >
      >The project is created only when the Stage is updated on the [!UICONTROL Opportunity]. A unique project is created for each product specified when the Stage field is updated, and not as the products are added to [!UICONTROL Opportunities].

1. (Optional) Click **[!UICONTROL New Trigger]**. 
1. (Optional) From the **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Salesforce] Object]** drop-down menu, select **Account
**.

   This is a required field. 
1. (Conditional) Specify the following: 

   1. Select a **[!UICONTROL Type]** from the **[!UICONTROL Type]** drop-down menu.

      When any **Account
** is designated as the **[!UICONTROL Type]** specified here in [!DNL Salesforce], a **[!UICONTROL Project]** is created in [!DNL Workfront].

      This is a required field. 

   1. (Optional) Start typing the name of a **[!UICONTROL Portfolio]** or **[!UICONTROL Program]** where you want the project to be placed in [!DNL Workfront] in the **[!UICONTROL Portfolio or Program]** field, then select it when it appears in the list.

      If you do not specify a Portfolio or a Program, the new project is created and added to the **[!UICONTROL Projects I Own]** list of the user logged in to [!DNL Workfront] from [!DNL Salesforce]. The user is also the Project Owner for the new project. 

   1. Start typing the name of a **[!UICONTROL Template]** that you want to associate with the new [!DNL Workfront] project, then select it when it appears in the list.

      This is a required field. 

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If you have specified a Template Owner on the template that you are planning to use for this integration, that becomes the Project Owner of the new project. The new projects appear under the **[!UICONTROL Projects I Own]** list of the user who is the owner of the new project, according to the template.

   ![salesforce_triggers_page_with_cleaned_up_template_names.png](assets/salesforce-triggers-page-with-cleaned-up-template-names-350x157.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   [!DNL Workfront] projects are now generated every time any of the triggers are met.

### Understanding Project Names {#understanding-project-names}

Depending on which trigger generated the projects, the names of the projects in [!DNL Workfront] could follow either one of these patterns:

* If the project is created based on an opportunity or account trigger, the name of the project is: *`<Salesforce object name>`: `<Project template name>` (via [!DNL Salesforce])*.
* If the project is created based on an opportunity trigger that also includes the addition of a new Product, the name of the project is: *`<Salesforce object name>`: `<Salesforce product name>` (via [!DNL Salesforce])*.

## View [!DNL Workfront] projects

If your [!DNL Workfront] administrator added the [!DNL Workfront] section to your [!UICONTROL Opportunity] or Account
 page layout, you can see the projects automatically created in the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab of this section.\
For more information about adding the [!DNL Workfront] section to the page layout of an [!UICONTROL Opportunity] or Account
, see [Configure the [!DNL Adobe Workfront] section for [!DNL Salesforce] users](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/configure-wf-section-for-salesforce-users.md).
