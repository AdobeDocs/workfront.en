## Workfront for Salesforce

You can do the following when using Workfront for Salesforce:

* Manually create new Workfront requests from Salesforce within an Opportunity or an Account.   

  For more information about creating Workfront requests from Salesforce, see [Submit Adobe Workfront requests from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/submit-workfront-requests-from-salesforce-objects.md).

* Automatically trigger the creation of projects in Workfront when certain criteria are met in Salesforce. Your Salesforce system administrator must configure triggers for creating projects from Salesforce. 

  For more information about creating Workfront projects from Salesforce, see [Create Adobe Workfront projects from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/create-wf-projects-from-salesforce-objects.md).

Consider the following when working with Workfront for Salesforce:

* We support both the Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience frameworks.&nbsp;
* Items can be created only from Salesforce in to Workfront. 
* You can view some information about the Workfront items in Salesforce.  

  This information cannot be customized. 

  For a list of Workfront fields that you can view from Salesforce, see  [Submit Adobe Workfront requests from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/submit-workfront-requests-from-salesforce-objects.md)&nbsp; and [Create Adobe Workfront projects from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/create-wf-projects-from-salesforce-objects.md).

* You can directly Go to the Salesforce items from Workfront.  

  You cannot view any information about the Salesforce items in Workfront, but you have a link to the Salesforce item from Workfront to review it in Salesforce. 
* Updating fields on one item in one application does not update any information on linked items in the other application.
