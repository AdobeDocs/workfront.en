# Authorize the [!DNL Zoom] integration

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Zoom integration was deprecated with the 22.4 release (September 2022). This article will be removed November 2022.

After your [!DNL Adobe Workfront] administrator enables the [!DNL Zoom] integration, you need to authorize the connection between [!DNL Workfront] and your [!DNL Zoom] account. This is necessary for each [!DNL Workfront] user.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Adobe Workfront] license*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Work], [!UICONTROL Plan]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

Your [!DNL Workfront] administrator must enable the [!DNL Zoom] integration before you can use it.

## Authorize the [!DNL Zoom] integration

1. Go to a [!DNL Workfront] object such as a task or issue.
1. In the left panel, click **[!UICONTROL Updates]** ![](assets/comment-icon.png).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Start a new update]**, then click the camera icon that displays below the box.

   You can use your [!DNL Zoom] login credentials or any other method, such as signing in with [!DNL Google].

   This authorization process occurs only one time, the first time you click this icon. The same is true for each user in your organization when they click the icon for the first time.

1. At the bottom of the page that says [!DNL Workfront] is requesting access to your [!DNL Zoom] account, click **[!UICONTROL Authorize]**.

   This page closes automatically when the connection is successfully authorized.

   You have connected [!DNL Workfront] to your [!DNL Zoom] account.

   Now you can click the camera icon ![](assets/zoom-icon-updates.png) in the [!UICONTROL [!DNL Workfront] Updates] area whenever you want to insert a [!DNL Zoom] meeting URL into an update or comment in the [!UICONTROL Updates] area.
