# Zoom integration overview

If your Adobe Workfront administrator has enabled the Zoom integration, you can start a Zoom meeting with collaborators by inserting a Zoom link into an Update comment or a reply.

Anyone tagged in the comment or reply receives an instant notification containing the link, depending on their notification settings. They can click to join the meeting directly from the notification or from the Updates area.

For more information about using the Updates area, see the section [Add an update to a work item](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md#add) in the article [Update work](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).

For information about how the Workfront administrator enables this integration, see [Install the Zoom integration](../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/enable-zoom-integration.md).

For information on how you can uninstall the Zoom integration in your personal Workfront instance, see [Uninstall the Zoom integration](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/zoom-integration-with-wf/uninstall-zoom-integration.md).
