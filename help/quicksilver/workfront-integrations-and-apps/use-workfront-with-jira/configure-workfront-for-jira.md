# Configure [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Jira]

<!-- Audited: 12/2023 -->

You can use [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Jira] to integrate your [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] systems.

After installing the add-on, you can define workflows that create [!DNL Jira] issues automatically when [!DNL Workfront] work items are created. The items in both applications become linked, and some of their information automatically updates in both systems.

All users in [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Jira] can benefit from this integration. They only need a license for the system in which they work the most, and not for both systems. 

This add-on is available for both the [!UICONTROL Server] and [!UICONTROL OnDemand] (or [!UICONTROL Cloud]) versions of [!DNL Jira] Software.

For a list of [!DNL Jira] versions that [!DNL Workfront for Jira] currently supports, see [[!DNL Workfront for Jira]](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218653/workfront-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) at the [!DNL Atlassian Marketplace].

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL [!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan]*</td> 
   <td><p>New: Any</p>

   </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">[!DNL Jira] access</td> 
   <td> <p>System administrator access</p> <p>Important:  We recommend that you create separate system administrator accounts in [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] to dedicate to this integration, rather than using existing ones that might be attached to users.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure [!DNL Workfront for Jira], you must:

* Install [!DNL Workfront for Jira].
   For instructions on installing [!DNL Workfront for Jira], see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Jira]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/install-workfront-for-jira.md).

## Configure [!DNL Workfront for Jira]

By configuring [!DNL Workfront for Jira], you can:

* Define triggers that will create [!DNL Jira] items when [!DNL Workfront] items are created.
* Specify which fields should synchronize between items linked between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront].

>[!NOTE]
>
>* After you configure [!DNL Workfront for Jira] on your [!DNL Jira] environment, all [!DNL Jira] users see a [!DNL Workfront] right panel on all [!DNL Jira] items. The panel contains information about the items that might be linked from [!DNL Workfront] or specifies that no [!DNL Workfront] items are linked to [!DNL Jira] items. 
>* When using the [!DNL Jira Server] installation, only the issues that are associated with projects identified as triggers for the Workfront integration display the Workfront panel. For more information about setting up triggers for the [!DNL Workfront to Jira] workflow, see [Configure triggers for automatically linking items between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront]](#configure-triggers-for-automatically-linking-items-between-jira-and-workfront).
>

To configure [!DNL Workfront for Jira]:

1. Log in to [!DNL Jira] as a [!DNL Jira] administrator.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** in the main [!DNL Jira] menu.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add-ons]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Manage add-ons]**.

1. Expand the **[!DNL Workfront]** add-on.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Configure]**.
1. Follow the prompts to log in to [!DNL Workfront].

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The user must have a valid `apiKey` in [!UICONTROL Workfront] to create a successful connection.

   You must log in to [!DNL Workfront] as a [!DNL Workfront] administrator to continue the configuration.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* [!UICONTROL Workfront] connects to [!DNL Jira] using OAuth 2.0, a standard used by most web-based integrations for the authentication and authorization of users.
   >* When you are prompted to enter the domain of your [!DNL Workfront] account, type it using this format: *yourCompany'sDomain.my.workfront.com*. Your company's domain is usually the name of your company.
   >* Enhanced Authentication is not available until a [!DNL Workfront] administrator enables it for this integration.

1. In Jira, select the **[!UICONTROL Triggers]** tab to configure the automatic creation of [!DNL Jira] items as new [!DNL Workfront] items are created.

   For more information about setting up triggers for the Workfront to [!DNL Jira] workflow, see [Configure triggers for automatically linking items between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront]](#configure-triggers-for-automatically-linking-items-between-jira-and-workfront).

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** tab to configure the synchronization of fields between linked [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] items.

   For more information about setting up the synchronization of fields between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront], see [Configure field synchronization between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] Items](#configure-field-synchronization-between-jira-and-workfront-items).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >After you define the triggers and the synchronization of fields between the two applications, any [!DNL Workfront] user who can create tasks or issues could potentially trigger the creation of an item in [!DNL Jira]. The user can create an item if the criteria on the item they create match the triggers in [!DNL Jira], even if the user does not have a [!DNL Jira] license. Also, any [!DNL Jira] user can immediately start working on the [!DNL Jira] item, and their updates are visible in [!DNL Workfront], without them having a [!DNL Workfront] license. Any updates in [!DNL Workfront] are also visible on the [!DNL Jira] items. 

1. (Optional) Select the **[!UICONTROL Activity Log]** tab to review any errors that might have occurred during the integration.

   For more information about the [!UICONTROL Activity Log], see [View the [!DNL Jira] [!UICONTROL Activity Log]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/view-the-jira-activity-log.md).

## Configure triggers for automatically linking items between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] 

As the [!DNL Jira] system administrator, you can define triggers that would automatically create issues in [!DNL Jira] when an item in [!DNL Workfront] meets certain criteria.

>[!NOTE]
>
>It could take up to 10 minutes for the integration to create new issues in [!DNL Jira].

Consider the following when configuring triggering the creation of [!DNL Jira] items as [!DNL Workfront] items are created:

* The integration is unidirectional: You can only trigger items that you create in [!DNL Workfront] to be automatically created in [!DNL Jira]. You cannot trigger items that you create in [!DNL Jira] to automatically be created in [!DNL Workfront]. 
* There is no limit to how many triggers you can have. 
* If an item that you create in [!DNL Workfront] matches more than one of the triggers, only one item is created in [!DNL Jira]. The item is created in [!DNL Jira] according to the first trigger (in the order that they have been defined in [!DNL Jira]). All other triggers are ignored. 
* Only one item in [!DNL Workfront] can be linked to one item in Jira. You can never link one [!DNL Workfront] item to multiple [!DNL Jira] issues, or one [!DNL Jira] issue to multiple [!DNL Workfront] items. 

To configure triggers for automatically creating items in [!DNL Jira]: 

1. Log in to [!DNL Jira] as a system administrator.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** in the main [!DNL Jira] menu.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add-ons]**, then **[!UICONTROL Manage add-ons]**.
1. Expand the **[!DNL Workfront]** add-on.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Configure]**.
1. Log in to [!DNL Workfront] as a system administrator.

   The **[!UICONTROL Triggers]** tab is selected by default in Jira.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add trigger]** to add a new trigger.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Workfront team/user/role]** field, specify the name of a [!DNL Workfront] team, user, or job role, then click to select it when it displays in the list. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You cannot have multiple triggers for the same team, user, or role.

   When someone creates a task or an issue and assigns it to one of these entities, an issue is automatically created in [!DNL [!DNL Jira]].

1. In the **[!UICONTROL [!DNL Jira] project]** field, start typing the name of a [!DNL Jira] project, then click to select it when it displays in the list.

   When the [!DNL Jira] issue is created, it is placed on the project you chose here.

1. Select an **I[!UICONTROL ssue type]** from the drop-down menu.

   This indicates the issue type that is created in [!DNL Jira] when the conditions of this trigger are met, based on your settings for that specific project in [!DNL Jira].

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 

   With this configuration, every time a [!DNL Workfront] user creates an item that matches the specified triggers, a new issue is created in [!DNL Jira].

## Configure field synchronization between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] Items 

As the [!DNL Jira] administrator, you can define which fields should automatically synchronize on items that are linked between [!DNL Workfront] and Jira. Certain fields can synchronize from the [!DNL Workfront] to the [!DNL Jira] item, and others synchronize from Jira to Workfront. 

To define what fields should automatically synchronize on items linked between the two applications:

1. Log in to [!DNL Jira] as a Jira administrator.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** in the main [!DNL Jira] menu.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add-ons]**, then **[!UICONTROL Manage add-ons]**.
1. Expand the **[!DNL Workfront]** add-on.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Configure]**.
1. Log in to [!DNL Workfront] as a Workfront administrator.
1. In Jira, click the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** tab.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Synchronize from Workfront to Jira]** section, select the fields that you want to update in [!DNL Jira] when they are updated in Workfront. 

   1. Select any of the following frequencies with which the fields are synchronized:

      <table style="table-layout:auto">
         <tr>
              <td>[!UICONTROL On Creation]</td>
              <td>The fields you specify are synchronized between the linked Workfront and [!DNL Jira] items when the item is created in Workfront.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>[!UICONTROL Always]</td>
              <td>The fields you specify are synchronized between the linked Workfront and [!DNL Jira] items when the fields are updated in Workfront. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>[!UICONTROL Never]</td>
              <td>The fields you specify are never synchronized between the linked [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Jira] items. There is no indication in [!DNL Jira] that the field was updated in [!DNL Workfront]. </td>
          </tr>
      </table>

   1. Select any of the following to synchronize the fields from [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Jira]: 

      <table style="table-layout:auto">
       <col>
       <col>
       <tbody>
        <tr>
         <td role="rowheader">[!UICONTROL Name]</td>
         <td><p>The name of a task or an issue in [!DNL Workfront] becomes the name of the issue to which it is linked in [!DNL Jira].</p><p>Note: When new items are created in [!DNL Jira] automatically, the [!DNL Workfront] Name always updates on the [!DNL Jira] item, regardless of whether this field is enabled here or not. When a [!DNL Jira] item is manually linked to a [!DNL Workfront] item, the Name of the [!DNL Workfront] item only updates in [!DNL Jira] when you select to <strong>Always</strong> synchronize this field. For more information about linking items manually or automatically, see <a href="../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/link-items-between-wf-jira.md" class="MCXref xref">Link items between [!DNL Adobe Workfront] and [!DNL Jira]</a>.</p></td>

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   Now, every time a user updates any of the fields specified in this configuration on an item in either [!DNL Jira] or [!DNL Workfront], the linked item in the other application is updated as well. 

## Troubleshooting

### Items cannot be created in [!DNL Jira] because of trigger fields marked "[!UICONTROL Couldn't be found]"

#### Problem

When an error occurs with the [!DNL Workfront for Jira] application, [!DNL Workfront] disables the triggers to prevent further complications. When those triggers are disabled, they display as "[!UICONTROL Couldn't be found]."

#### Solution

Locate the error that disabled the triggers. You can find the error in the [!DNL Workfront for Jira] [!UICONTROL Activity Log].

The most common cause of this behavior is the error "[!UICONTROL Field 'duedate' cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.]"

This error means that you are attempting to sync the "[!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date]" from [!DNL Workfront] to [!DNL Jira]. In order to do this, you must ensure that your [!DNL Jira] objects have a field called "[!UICONTROL Due Date]." If they do not have this field, [!DNL Workfront] is unable to sync the planned completion date from [!DNL Workfront] and disables your triggers.

To resolve this error, try one of the following:

* Ask your [!DNL Jira] administrator to update the affected [!DNL Jira] objects to ensure that they have a due date field.
* Disable the synchronization of [!DNL Workfront]'s planned completion date in the Workfront [!UICONTROL Setup] page.
