# Link items between [!DNL Adobe Workfront] and [!DNL Jira]

You can link [!DNL Jira] issues to [!DNL Adobe Workfront] tasks or issues either automatically or manually.

Only one item in [!DNL Workfront] can be linked to one item in [!DNL Jira]. You can never link one [!DNL Workfront] item to multiple [!DNL Jira] issues, nor one [!DNL Jira] issue to multiple [!DNL Workfront] items.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans" target="_blank">[!DNL [!DNL Adobe Workfront] plan]</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Pro] or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md" class="MCXref xref">Adobe [!DNL Workfront] licenses overview</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Jira access</td> 
   <td> <p>System administrator access</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>  
   
   We recommend that you create separate system administrator accounts in [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] to dedicate to this integration, rather than using existing ones that might be attached to users.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a [!DNL Workfront] administrator. For information on [!DNL Workfront] administrators, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p><b>NOTE</b>
   
   If you still don't have access, ask your [!DNL Workfront] administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your [!DNL Workfront] administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you can link items between [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Jira], you must

* Install [!DNL Workfront] for [!DNL Jira]

   For instructions on installing Workfront for Jira, see [Install Adobe Workfront for Jira](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/install-workfront-for-jira.md).

* Configure [!DNL Workfront] for Jira

   For instructions on configuring Workfront for Jira, see [Configure Adobe Workfront for Jira](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/configure-workfront-for-jira.md).

## Automatically link [!DNL Workfront] items to [!DNL Jira] issues {#automatically-link-workfront-items-to-jira-issues}

As a [!DNL Workfront] administrator, you can define triggers that can automatically create an issue in [!DNL Jira] every time certain conditions are met on a task or an issue in [!DNL Workfront]. The Workfront and [!DNL Jira] items become linked.

After you have completed the configuration of [!DNL Workfront] for Jira, when an item is either created or updated in [!DNL Workfront] to match your triggers, a new item is automatically created in [!DNL Jira].\
Workfront users that create and update Workfront items do not need a [!DNL Jira] license to trigger the creation of items in [!DNL Jira].

For more information about defining triggers for creating Jira issues automatically, see  [Configure [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for Jira](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/configure-workfront-for-jira.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can create [!DNL Jira] items automatically by attaching a template to a project. If the template contains tasks with assignments that meet the [!DNL Jira] triggers, the new tasks generate new [!DNL Jira] issues.

Automatically linking a [!DNL Workfront] issue to a [!DNL Jira] issue is identical to automatically linking a [!DNL Workfront] task to a [!DNL Jira] issue.

To automatically link a [!DNL Workfront] task to a [!DNL Jira] issue:

1. Ensure that your [!DNL Jira] system administrator has configured triggers for automatically creating [!DNL Jira] issues when [!DNL Workfront] items are assigned, then log in to [!DNL Workfront] with an access level that allows you to create a task.

   For more information about access to tasks, see [Grant access to tasks](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-tasks.md).

1. Go to a project and select **[!UICONTROL Tasks]** ![](assets/tasks-icon-in-left-panel-14x14.png) in the left panel.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL New Task]**

   Or

   Select an existing task, then click **Edit**.

1. Specify or update any of the fields available for the task.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Assignments]** and assign the task to a user, role, or team which is specified as a trigger in the [!DNL Jira] integration.

1. Click **Save Changes**.

   A new task is created in Workfront.

   In the **[!UICONTROL Updates]** area of the new task, there is a comment to indicate that a new issue has also been created in [!DNL Jira].

   ![WF_confirmation_that_Jira_issue_was_created.png](assets/wf-confirmation-that-jira-issue-was-created-350x43.png)

1. (Optional) Click the link to the Jira issue to open it in Jira.

   Or

   Click the **[!UICONTROL Go to Jira]** link in the **[!UICONTROL Integrations]** area of the **[!UICONTROL Details]** section or the task or issue header, to open the [!DNL Jira] issue.

   Your system or group administrator must add the [!UICONTROL Integrations] field to your layout template to display it in the task or issue header. For information, see [Customize object headers using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-object-headers.md).

   Any [!DNL Jira] user can immediately start working on items automatically created from [!DNL Workfront] and their updates will transfer to [!DNL Workfront] without needing a license for [!DNL Workfront] to do so.

   Only the fields that you as a [!DNL Workfront] administrator configured during the setup of the [!DNL Workfront] add-on are updated.

   For more information about synchronizing fields between Workfront and Jira, see the [Configure Workfront for Jira](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/configure-workfront-for-jira.md#configuring-the-add-on-for-jira) section in  [Configure Adobe Workfront for Jira](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/configure-workfront-for-jira.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!DNL Jira] issue is not assigned to anyone in [!DNL Jira] when it is automatically created from Workfront.

## Manually link [!DNL Jira] issues to [!DNL Workfront] items

After items have been created in [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront], independent of each other, you can manually link a [!DNL Jira] issue to an existing [!DNL Workfront] task or issue.\
You cannot manually link a [!DNL Workfront] item from [!DNL Workfront] to an existing [!DNL Jira] item.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the [!DNL Jira] issue is not on a project which is not identified as a trigger in the [!DNL Workfront] Integration you cannot manually link it to a Workfront item when using the integration with [!DNL Jira] On-Premise.\
>For more information about setting up triggers for the Workfront to Jira workflow, see [Automatically link Workfront items to Jira issues](#automatically-link-dnl-workfront-items-to-dnl-jira-issues-automatically-link-workfront-items-to-jira-issues).

When [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Jira] items are linked, certain fields from one item can be automatically updated on the other.\
For more information about updating linked items, see [Update linked items between Jira and Adobe Workfront](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/update-linked-items-between-jira-wf.md).

To manually link [!DNL Jira] issues to [!DNL Workfront] items:

1. (Conditional) Log in to [!DNL Workfront] and find an issue or a task that you want to link to [!DNL Jira] issue.
1. (Conditional) From the address bar of the item, copy the **URL** of the item in Workfront.

   Or

   From the [!UICONTROL Details] area ![](assets/details-icon-in-left-panel.png), copy the **[!UICONTROL Reference Number]** of the item in Workfront.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You must have a [!DNL Workfront] license to log in to [!DNL Workfront]. Otherwise, a [!DNL Workfront] user must supply this information to you.

1. In [!DNL Jira], navigate to an issue that you want to manually link to the [!DNL Workfront] item.
1. In the [!DNL Workfront] right panel, paste the **URL** or the **[!UICONTROL Reference Number]** of the [!DNL Workfront] item which you want to link to it.\
   ![manually_link_items_Jira_WF.png](assets/manually-link-items-jira-wf-350x174.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Link]**.

   The two items become linked and the [!DNL Workfront] right panel is populated with information from the [!DNL Workfront] item.

   The following [!DNL Workfront] fields are visible in [!DNL Jira], by default, in the [!DNL Workfront] right panel:

   * The **[!UICONTROL Name]** of the item: You can access the [!DNL Workfront] item by clicking the name in the panel. 
   * **[!UICONTROL Project Name]**
   * The **[!UICONTROL Status]** of the item
   * The **[!UICONTROL Priority]** of the item
   * The date on which it was created in [!DNL Workfront]
   * The **[!UICONTROL Planned Hours]** of the item
   * The **[!UICONTROL Reference Number]**: You can access the [!DNL Workfront] item by clicking the [!UICONTROL Reference Number] in the panel.

For more information about enabling additional fields to display in the right panel, see [Configure field synchronization between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] Items](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/configure-workfront-for-jira.md#setting-up-field-synchronization) section in [Configure [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Jira]](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/configure-workfront-for-jira.md). A comment from the [!DNL Workfront] administrator associated with the integration is posted in the **[!DNL Workfront]** tab of the [!DNL Jira] issue to confirm that a new [!DNL Jira] item has been created. The comment contains a link to the [!DNL Jira] issue.

You need the following access to unlink manually linked item:

* You are the user who manually linked the items
* You are the [!DNL Jira] system administrator

Only a [!DNL Workfront] administrator can unlink items that were automatically linked. 

To unlink a [!DNL Jira] issue from a [!DNL Workfront] item:
