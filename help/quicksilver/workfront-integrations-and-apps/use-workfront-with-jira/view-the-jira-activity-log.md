## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col>

   <td> <p>[!UICONTROL Plan]</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

   <td> <p>System administrator access</p> <p>Important:  We recommend that you create separate system administrator accounts in [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] to dedicate to this integration, rather than using existing ones that might be attached to users.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a [!DNL Workfront] administrator.
