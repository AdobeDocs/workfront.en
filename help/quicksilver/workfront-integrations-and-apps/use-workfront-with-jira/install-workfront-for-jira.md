# Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Jira]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To deliver more stable and scalable integrations, we're shifting to a modern, flexible integration approach using Workfront Automation and Integration (Fusion). As part of this transition process, the Workfront for Jira integration will not be available after **February 28, 2026**. 
>
>We recommend using Workfront Automation and Integration for your organization's integration needs with Jira. 
>
>Eight ready-to-use Workfront Automation and Integration templates for Jira will be available by August to help replicate common workflows and accelerate implementation. Templates are fully customizable to meet specific business needs and can be extended as requirements evolve. 
> 
>For an overview of Workfront Automation and Integration, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/get-started-with-fusion/understand-workfront-fusion/workfront-fusion-overview). 
>
>For information about the specific capabilities of the Workfront Automation and Integration modules for Jira, see [Jira Software modules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/references/apps-and-their-modules/third-party-app-connectors/jira-software-modules). 

You can use [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Jira] to integrate your [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront] systems.

After installing the add-on, you can define workflows that create [!DNL Jira] issues automatically when [!DNL Workfront] work items are created. The items in both applications become linked, and some of their information can be automatically updated in both systems. 

All users in [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Jira] can benefit from this integration. They only need a license for the system in which they work the most, and not for both systems. 

This add-on is available for the [!UICONTROL Server] and [!UICONTROL OnDemand] (or [!UICONTROL Cloud]) versions of [!DNL Jira] Software. This add-on is not available for the [!DNL Data Center] version of [!DNL Jira] Software.

For a list of [!DNL Jira] versions that [!DNL Workfront for Jira] currently supports, see [[!DNL [!DNL Workfront for Jira]]](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218653/workfront-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) at the Atlassian Marketplace.

+++## Install [!DNL Workfront] for [!DNL Jira]

Installing [!DNL Workfront] for [!DNL Jira] OnDemand is identical to installing it on a [!DNL Jira] Server instance.

You must be a [!DNL Jira] administrator to install the [!DNL Workfront] add-on.

If you are not a [!DNL Jira] administrator, you can browse for the [!DNL Workfront] add-on and request it to be installed. Your request is sent to the [!DNL Jira] administrator for approval and installation. 

For more information about requesting an add-on to be installed on your [!DNL Jira] application, see [Managing user requests for add-ons.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/managing-user-requests-for-add-ons-781394968.html)

To install [!DNL Workfront for Jira]:

1. Log in to [!DNL Jira] as a [!DNL Jira] administrator.
1. Find the **[!DNL Workfront for Jira]** add-on in the [[!DNL Atlassian Marketplace]](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218653/workfront-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Get it now]** to install it.

   After the installation completes, you can log in to [!DNL Workfront] from [!DNL Jira] and configure your integration.

   For more information, see [Configure Adobe Workfront for Jira](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/use-workfront-with-jira/configure-workfront-for-jira.md).

## Considerations for a [!DNL Jira Server] installation

>[!NOTE]
>
>These requirements do not apply to the [!UICONTROL OnDemand] ([!UICONTROL Cloud]) version of [!DNL Jira] Software.

Although installing the [!DNL Workfront] add-on in the two [!DNL Jira] environments is similar, you must consider the following when working with a [!DNL Jira Server] installation:

* When configuring the add-on in [!DNL Jira], the address specified in the **[!DNL JIRA Base URL]** field may not be the same URL you use to access [!DNL Jira] on your private server. The **[!DNL JIRA Base URL]** must be a publicly-accessible address connected to your private server using NAT or reverse proxy protocols, so [!DNL Workfront] can access it to make requests to your server.  

* You must use SSL encryption to secure the communication between [!DNL Jira] and [!DNL Workfront]. When you enable SSL, you must have a full SSL certificate stack from a certificate authority. We do not support self-signed certificates. 
* You must ensure that the [!DNL jira.workfront.com] domain is accessible from your corporate servers. It serves as a middleware environment between [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Jira] and is required for the add-on to operate.

   You must also add the following static IP addresses to the allowlist on your firewall for outbound and inbound connections.

   `35.162.128.73`

   `34.213.36.118`

   `35.160.0.242`

   `3.209.27.146`

   `18.205.251.4`

   For more information about configuring your firewall for optimal functionality with [!DNL Workfront], see [Configuring Your Firewall](../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-firewall.md).
