# Search for and share [!DNL Adobe Workfront] items in [!DNL Microsoft Teams]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>As [Microsoft transitions to the New Teams client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability), the Classic Teams client will no longer be available after July 1, 2025. To continue using Microsoft Teams and integrated apps like Workfront, customersâ€¯must transition to the New Teams client before this date. 
>
>The updated Workfront integration is now available and fully compatible with the New Teams experience. In most cases, Workfront will appear automatically once users have transitioned. If it does not, the integration can be manually installed from the Microsoft Teams App Store. To install or verify the Workfront integration in the New Teams client, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for Microsoft Teams](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-microsoft-teams/install-workfront-ms-teams.md). 

You can search for [!DNL Workfront] items in any [!DNL Adobe Workfront] channel in [!DNL Microsoft Teams] and share these items with members of your teams.
