# Manage [!DNL Adobe Workfront] notifications in [!DNL Microsoft Teams]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>As [Microsoft transitions to the New Teams client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability), the Classic Teams client will no longer be available after July 1, 2025. To continue using Microsoft Teams and integrated apps like Workfront, customers must transition to the New Teams client before this date. 
>
>The updated Workfront integration is now available and fully compatible with the New Teams experience. In most cases, Workfront will appear automatically once users have transitioned. If it does not, the integration can be manually installed from the Microsoft Teams App Store. To install or verify the Workfront integration in the New Teams client, see [Install [!DNL Adobe Workfront] for Microsoft Teams](/help/quicksilver/workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-microsoft-teams/install-workfront-ms-teams.md).

These notifications contain [!DNL Workfront] actions that you can take within [!DNL Microsoft Teams] without navigating away from [!DNL Microsoft Teams] to accomplish them. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Microsoft Teams] no longer supports [!DNL Internet Explorer]. To use the [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Microsoft Teams integration], you must use a web browser other than [!DNL Internet Explorer].
