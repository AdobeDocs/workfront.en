# Export a list of timesheets

As a people manager or timesheet approver, you might need to download a list of timesheets to quickly view information about the timesheets of the people you are responsible for. You can do this by exporting a list of timesheets.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Review</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher to Tasks and Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher permissions on the timesheets</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td>
