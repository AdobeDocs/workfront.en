# Submit a timesheet for approval

Submitting your timesheet provides&nbsp;your manager with visibility into your work hours. Approvers can verify that&nbsp;all time recorded has been allocated in the correct areas and that&nbsp;a sufficient number of hours have been recorded for the period.

### Submit a timesheet for approval

After a timesheet approver is set (as described in the section [Designate timesheet approvers](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/timesheet-approvals.md#designating-a-timesheet-approver) in the article [Approve a timesheet](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/timesheet-approvals.md)), the `Save and Close Timesheet` button at the bottom of the timesheet changes to a `Submit for Approval`&nbsp;button.

To submit a timesheet for approval:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Go to a timesheet that has been configured to have an approver. </p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Log time, as described in <a href="../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/log-time.md" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" class="MCXref xref">Log time</a>.</p> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Submit for Approval</span> to launch the timesheet approval process. </p> <p> <img src="assets/submit-for-approval-button-on-timesheet-nwe-350x493.png" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" style="width: 350;height: 493;"> </p> <p>The <span class="bold">Save for Later</span> and <span class="bold">Submit for Approval</span> buttons are replaced by the <span class="bold">Recall</span> button. The status of the timesheet changes to <span class="bold">Submitted</span>. </p> <p>When your timesheet is submitted for approval, the approver sees the timesheet listed in the <span class="bold">Approvals</span>&nbsp;area on the <span class="bold">Home</span> page. The following things might occur: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <p>If they approve it, the <span class="bold">Recall</span> button changes to <span class="bold">Re-Open</span> and the timesheet status updates to <span class="bold">Closed</span>. </p> </li> 
   <li> <p>If they reject it, <span class="bold">Save for Later</span> and <span class="bold">Submit for Approval</span> buttons replace the <span class="bold">Recall</span> button and the timesheet status updates to <span class="bold">Rejected</span>.</p> </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>(Optional)&nbsp;Click&nbsp;<span class="bold">Recall</span> if you need to reopen the timesheet and update your time. For information, see <a href="#recalling-a-timesheet" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" class="MCXref xref">Recall a timesheet</a>.</p> </li> 
</ol>

### View the status of a submitted timesheet

You can view the status of a timesheet after it has been submitted.

If the system&nbsp;administrator has&nbsp;enabled the "Timesheet Approval to User" and the "Timesheet Rejection to User" event handlers, you are notified after the timesheet is approved or rejected. Without these notifications, the only indication you have of a rejected timesheet is to go to the My Timesheets report (which displays all timesheets belonging to the logged-in user that have not been closed) to review the status of the active timesheets.

To view the status of a timesheet:

## Recall a timesheet

You can recall a timesheet that has already been submitted for approval. Only timesheets that haven't been approved can be recalled.

To recall a timesheet:

1. Select a timesheet with a status of Submitted.
1. Click `Recall`.
