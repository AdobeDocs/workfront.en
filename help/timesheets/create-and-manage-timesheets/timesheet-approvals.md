# Approve a timesheet {#approve-a-timesheet}

The process of approving timesheets provides&nbsp;managers with visibility into the work hours of their direct reports. Approvers can verify that&nbsp;all time recorded has been allocated in the correct areas and that&nbsp;a sufficient number of hours have been recorded for the period.


*`Adobe Workfront`* provides the ability to configure timesheet approvals to support in this area.


For information on submitting a timesheet, see [Submit a timesheet for approval](submit-timesheet-for-approval.md).


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="width: 100%;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('../../Resources/TableStyles/TableStyle-List-options-in-steps.css');" class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps" cellspacing="0">

 <tbody>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your *`Workfront administrator`*.


## Designate timesheet approvers {#designate-timesheet-approvers}

Typically, timesheets are approved by functional managers or human resources personnel. (Timesheets are not normally approved by project managers.)


A timesheet approver is defined when creating the Timesheet Profile.&nbsp;You must have a Plan license to be designated as an approver.


For more information about designating timesheet approvers, see the section [Create or edit a timesheet profile](create-timesheet-profiles.md#create) in the article [Create, edit, and assign timesheet profiles](create-timesheet-profiles.md).


## Approve a timesheet {#approve-a-timesheet-1}

You can approve any timesheets that have been submitted where you have been designated as an approver. When a timesheet is submitted for approval, the timesheet is listed in the `Approvals` area on your `My Work`&nbsp;page.


If the system administrator has enabled the "Timesheet Submission to Approver" event handler (automated email), you will receive an email notification stating that a timesheet is awaiting approval. For information about how system administrators can enable this email notification, see [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md).
