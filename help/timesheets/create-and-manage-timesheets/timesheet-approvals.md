# Approve a timesheet

The process of approving timesheets provides&nbsp;managers with visibility into the work hours of their direct reports. Approvers can verify that&nbsp;all time recorded has been allocated in the correct areas and that&nbsp;a sufficient number of hours have been recorded for the period.

*Adobe Workfront* provides the ability to configure timesheet approvals to support in this area.

For information on submitting a timesheet, see [Submit a timesheet for approval](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/submit-timesheet-for-approval.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Plan</em> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.

## Designate timesheet approvers

Typically, timesheets are approved by functional managers or human resources personnel. (Timesheets are not normally approved by project managers.)

A timesheet approver is defined when creating the Timesheet Profile.&nbsp;You must have a Plan license to be designated as an approver.

For more information about designating timesheet approvers, see the section [Create or edit a timesheet profile](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md#create) in the article [Create, edit, and assign timesheet profiles](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md).

## Approve a timesheet

You can approve any timesheets that have been submitted where you have been designated as an approver. When a timesheet is submitted for approval, the timesheet is listed in the `Approvals` area on your `My Work`&nbsp;page.

If the system administrator has enabled the "Timesheet Submission to Approver" event handler (automated email), you will receive an email notification stating that a timesheet is awaiting approval. For information about how system administrators can enable this email notification, see [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md).
