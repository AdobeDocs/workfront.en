# Prevent the recalculate finances action from affecting historic hours {#prevent-the-recalculate-finances-action-from-affecting-historic-hours}



## Problem {#problem}

You need to update the hourly cost for a user (due to a raise or another circumstance), but you do not want this change to affect hours that have previously been submitted, or you want it to affect only a portion of historical hours. 


## Solution {#solution}

Mark hours you do not want changed as Billed.&nbsp; This locks in the old rate and will be ignored by the Recalculate Finances action.&nbsp; Any non-billed hours will be calculated at the new rate.
