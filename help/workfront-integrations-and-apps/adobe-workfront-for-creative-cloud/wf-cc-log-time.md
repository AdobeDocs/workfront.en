# Log time in Adobe Photoshop

You can log time for projects, tasks, and issues you're working on directly in Photoshop. The `Workfront administrator` determines which project-specific hour types are available as described in [Manage hour types](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/hour-types.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> Adobe Workfront license* Work or Plan 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>You must have an Adobe Creative Cloud license in addition to a <span>Workfront</span> license.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to tasks or issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Log Hours permission to the task or issue</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>
