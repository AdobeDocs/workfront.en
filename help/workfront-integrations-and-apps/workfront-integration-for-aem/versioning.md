&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.

## Prerequisites

* You must install Workfront Tools for Adobe Experience Manager before you can use it.

  For instructions, see [Workfront Tools for AEM User Guide: Installation Guide 1.x.x](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-integration-for-aem/installation-guide.md)

## Advanced Settings for Versioning

<ul> 
 <li> <p>Store assets with the same name as versions of the existing asset:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <p>When checked, this option will enable storing assets uploaded with the same name and to the same location as the version of the existing asset. If left unchecked, a new asset will be created with a different name (e.g. asset-name.pdf and asset-name-1.pdf)</p> </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li> <p>Update asset metadata when creating a new version:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <p>When checked, this option will update the asset metadata whenever a new version of the asset is created. If unchecked, the asset will keep the metadata it had prior to creating the new version.</p> <p> <img src="assets/auto-version-settings-350x290.png" style="width: 350;height: 290;"> </p> </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul>

When an asset has been sent from Workfront to AEM the version history of the asset will be managed in AEM. See [Managing AEM Assets](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/assets/managing/managing-assets-touch-ui.html#timeline) for more information.

## Current Limitations of Versioning

* *Workfront* document versioning is currently unsupported within linked folders.

  * When creating a *Workfront* *Proof* with a document inside a linked folder you will lose your previous versionâ€™s comments and annotations.
