## Prerequisites

* You must install Workfront Tools for Adobe Experience Manager before you can use it to set statuses.

## Set Status

This workflow step will allow a user to set `Adobe Workfront` statuses on Projects, Tasks, and Issues. This workflow step can be added to any workflow model. The `Workfront` artifact this step affects will be looked up using a relative path from the payload. The status is statically defined in the dialog configuration.
