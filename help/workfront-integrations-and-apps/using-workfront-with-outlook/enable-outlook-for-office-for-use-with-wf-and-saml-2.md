# Enable Outlook for Office for use with `Adobe Workfront` and SAML 2.0

If your `Adobe Workfront` system is integrated with SAML 2.0, you must enable SAML 2.0 authentication for Office add-ins in order for users to be able to authenticate using their SAML 2.0 credentials.&nbsp;

If you experience issues when logging in to `Workfront` with SAML, contact your `Workfront administrator` to ensure that SAML is configured correctly.

For information about how to enable Office add-ins to authenticate using a SAML 2.0 solution, see the section in the [Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 2.0](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/configure-workfront-saml-2.md) article.
