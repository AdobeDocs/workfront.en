Consider the following when working with Workfront for Salesforce:

* We support both the Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience frameworks.&nbsp;
* Items can be created only from Salesforce in to Workfront. 
* You can view some information about the Workfront items in Salesforce.  
  This information cannot be customized.  
  For a list of Workfront fields that you can view from Salesforce, see the [Submit Adobe Workfront requests from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/submit-workfront-requests-from-salesforce-objects.md) section in [Submit Adobe Workfront requests from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/submit-workfront-requests-from-salesforce-objects.md)&nbsp; and the [Create Adobe Workfront projects from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/create-wf-projects-from-salesforce-objects.md) section in [Create Adobe Workfront projects from Salesforce objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/create-wf-projects-from-salesforce-objects.md).

* You can directly Go to the Salesforce items from Workfront.  
  You cannot view any information about the Salesforce items in Workfront, but you have a link to the Salesforce item from Workfront to review it in Salesforce. 
* Updating fields on one item in one application does not update any information on linked items in the other application.
