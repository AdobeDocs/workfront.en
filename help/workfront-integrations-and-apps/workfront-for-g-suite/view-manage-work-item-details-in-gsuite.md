## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

## View and manage work item details in G Suite {#view-and-manage-work-item-details-in-g-suite}




1. If the *`Workfront for G Suite`* panel is not displayed, click the  *`Workfront`* icon ![](assets/wf-lion-icon.png) in the G Suite add-ons sidebar at the far-right of the page. 

1.  Go to the *`Workfront`* task or issue within G Suite, as described in [Access Adobe Workfront Home content from G Suite](access-wf-home-content-from-g-suite.md).


   When you select a task or issue, the `Details` tab is open. The area above the `Details` tab displays the name of the parent object, the name of the task or issue, and the Due date (if it's a task) or Priority date (if it's an issue).

   You can do various tasks on this tab without leaving G Suite, including the following: 

    
    
    *  View the object's `Description` and other details, such as the users assigned to the object, the `Priority`, the requester, the `Planned completion date`, and any custom fields and forms attached to the object. 
    
    
      Custom forms display only fields where information has been added.
    
    *  Click the `Parent project` area to view the details of the parent object. 
    
    
      >[!TIP] {type="tip"}
      >

    * Accept work assigned to you by clicking `Work on it`.
    *  Edit various options, such as `Done` option, the `Status`, and the `Percent complete`. 
    
    
      Under `Percent complete`, type numbers and (optionally) the percentage sign % to indicate your progress on an item. 
    
    * View information about an approval request, including the owner, size, and any attachments. 
    * `Approve` or `Reject` approval requests and documents.
    
    * `Grant` or `Ignore` access requests.
