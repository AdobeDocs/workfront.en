# Teams overview {#teams-overview}

The purpose of a team in `Workfront` is to capture the real-life dynamic of functional working groups in the workplace.&nbsp;


For information about how when to use teams instead of groups, see [Understand the differences and similarities between Groups and Teams](understanding-differences-and-similarities-between-groups-and-teams.md).


## Team Organization {#team-organization}

A `Workfront` Team differs from a project team. `Workfront` teams include individuals of diverse job roles or various purposes, who are functionally affiliated and organized into a working unit. An individual can belong to more than one team. Team members might match org chart relationships, but they can also appear outside the department structure.


## Team Creation {#team-creation}

Teams are typically created by a `Workfront administrator`, but a user with appropriate access can create teams as well. &nbsp;Once a team is created, the Project Manager can assign an entire team to a task instead of deciding on an individual or job role.


## Team Assignments {#team-assignments}

A Project Manager does not always know which individual will complete an assignment-simply that a particular work unit or team&nbsp;completes work of that specific nature.


Members of an assigned team can also Go to the People > Teams and see the tasks assigned to their team. They can assess the impact of a task and volunteer to work on it.
