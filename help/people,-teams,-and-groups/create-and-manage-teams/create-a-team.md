# Create a team {#create-a-team}

You must have a Plan license to create teams. 


When you create a team you become the Team Owner, by default.


You can view Team Owners for all the teams when you create a report for Teams and include the Owner Name field in your report. (For more information about creating a report, see [Create a report](create-report.md).)


You can create a team either from the People area or from the Setup area.
