You must have the following before you can start:

` `**Tip: **``

* When printing a list of goals, the file produced contains only the information displayed on the screen. Items eliminated by filtering a list of goals do not display in the .pdf file.
* When you do not expand the goals in the list before printing the list, the .pdf file displays only goals without their results and activities.
