## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.

<!--
Move goals to another time period in the Production environment We recommend that you create goals for quarterly and yearly time periods. After you spend the quarter or the year tracking and updating progress on your goals across the organization, you may find that you cannot yet complete them. In this case, you can copy the unfinished goal and place it in a new time period. Go to a goal with a past time period that you want to move to another period. Copy the goal. For information about copying a goal, see Copy goals in Adobe Workfront Goals. Some of the goal information transfers to the copied goal, giving you a start for a new time period. For example, you can copy the following information from an existing goal to a copied goal: Name Description Owner Results and their owner Important: You cannot copy goal or result progress when copying goals. Activate the goal. For information about creating and activating goals, see Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals

## Move goals to another time period

You can update the Period field on a goal when you edit it. For information about editing goals, see [Edit goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/edit-goals.md).
