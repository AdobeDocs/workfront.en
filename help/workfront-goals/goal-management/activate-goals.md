# Activate goals in *`Adobe Workfront Goals`* {#activate-goals-in-adobe-workfront-goals}

When you create a goal, *`Adobe Workfront Goals`* saves it with a status of Draft. Drafted goals are not part of goal management. 


To keep track of how close you are to achieving a goal, you must activate it. This changes its status to Active. For information about creating a goal, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](create-goals.md).


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}
