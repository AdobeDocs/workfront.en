# Delete and deactivate goals in *Adobe Workfront Goals*

When you start working on a goal and it becomes irrelevant in your organization, we recommend deactivating it, instead of deleting it. Deactivating a goal keeps its historical information and gives you a chance to reactivate it at a later time. There are times, however, when deleting a goal might make sense, to keep your goal list accurate.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col>

 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td>

### Considerations when deactivating goals

Remember the following when deactivating goals:

<ul> 
 <li> <p>You can only deactivate goals in an Active status. For information about activating a goal, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-management/activate-goals.md" class="MCXref xref">Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>.</p> <note type="tip">
   You cannot deactivate goals in a Draft status. 
  </note> </li> 
 <li><em>Workfront</em> stops calculating the progress of deactivated goals. </li> 
 <li>Inactive goals no longer display on or are taken into account in the following areas of <em>Workfront Goals</em>:
  <ul>
   <li>The <em>Check-in</em> section. For information about the Check-in page, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/check-in-goals.md" class="MCXref xref">Check in on goals in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>. </li>
   <li>The Graphs section. For information about <em>Workfront Goals</em> graphs, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/review-goal-graphs.md" class="MCXref xref">Review graphs to understand goal progress trends in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>.</li>
  </ul></li> 
 <li>You can no longer make updates on deactivated goals. </li> 
 <li>You can edit information about the goal and its alignment. </li> 
 <li>You can reactivate a previously deactivated goal. </li> 
</ul>

### Deactivate goals

 <li value="1"> <p>Go to the goal that you want to deactivate. </p> <p>For example, go to the <em>Goal List</em> and click the name of a goal. </p> <p>The Goal Details panel opens on the right. </p> <note type="tip">
   You can open goals from any sections of 
   <em>Workfront Goals</em>.
