# Delete and deactivate goals in *`Adobe Workfront Goals`* {#delete-and-deactivate-goals-in-adobe-workfront-goals}

When you start working on a goal and it becomes irrelevant in your organization, we recommend deactivating it, instead of deleting it. Deactivating a goal keeps its historical information and gives you a chance to reactivate it at a later time. There are times, however, when deleting a goal might make sense, to keep your goal list accurate. 


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following:
