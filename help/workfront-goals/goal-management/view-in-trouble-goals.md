## Prerequisites

## Recommendations for preventing goals to reach a progress of In&nbsp;Trouble

Before goals reach a progress of In&nbsp;Trouble, you can monitor them often and adjust their progress when they reach a progress of At Risk. Goals that are at risk are in danger of becoming in trouble.&nbsp;For more information about goal progress, see [Calculate goal progress in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/calculate-goal-progress.md)

Before your goals reach a progress of In Trouble, we recommend the following:

* Review goals that are have a progress of At Risk often that are assigned to you as well as organizational goals that are assigned to your teams, groups, or to your organization which might be affected by the progress of your goals. At-risk goals are in danger of becoming in-trouble goals. The at-risk goals are marked by a yellow progress bar. Use the `Goal List` and the `Pulse` sections to view goals that belong to you, your teams, groups, or your organization. 

* Review at-risk goals in the `Check-in` section if you want to view just goals where you are the owner and check in on them to update their progress.&nbsp;For information about checking in on goals, see [Check in on goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/check-in-goals.md).

## Review in-trouble goals in the `Goal List`

You can review goals in any section of `Workfront Goals`. For information about the `Workfront Goals` sections, see [Overview of the Adobe Workfront Goals sections](../../workfront-goals/goal-review-and-workfront-goals-sections/overview-of-wf-goals-sections.md).

This article describes how to review goals in the `Goal List`.
