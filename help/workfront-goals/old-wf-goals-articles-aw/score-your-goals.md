Objective Scoring is a performance rating given by an employee before closing out a objective.

Objective scoring is made up of two sections: `Closing Notes` and `Score your Performance`. Closing Notes will be made in a commenting field, and Score your Performance will include a progress slider with values from 0 to 10.

>[!NOTE]

>An objective cannot be closed without scoring. By default, objective scoring is enabled for all users. However, `Admins can turn goal scoring off if desired`.

Disabling objective scoring does not disable the prompt to add a comment on objective completion, but it will make Closing Notes optional.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are closing an objective with active contributing objectives, its progress may change after closing, and the alignment status of all contribution objectives will be changed to “No.”
