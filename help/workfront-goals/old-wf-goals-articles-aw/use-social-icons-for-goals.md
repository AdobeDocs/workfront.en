You can encourage progress of your colleagues across the organization when  `viewing objectives`. Social icons are located on the  `Objective Details Page` under the  `Additional Details` section. By clicking an icon, you will perform the corresponding action (Praise or Nudge). To comment, enter the text into the commenting field and click  `Post`.

Any employee can go into any Departmental, Team or Individual Objectives to view the social features.
