When you share a goal you give Manage permissions to a goal to someone who did not create it.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td>

 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

* A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.

## Considerations about sharing goals

* Users can have the following permissions to a goal:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">View</td> 
   <td>In this case, users have permissions to view the goal, but they cannot edit information for the goal, they cannot add or edit information for results, or activities, update status, or delete the goal. By default, all users with access to Goals can view all goals in the system. Users can copy the goal, if they have Edit access to Goals in their access level. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Manage</td> 
   <td> <p>Users can edit all information for the goal, including for the results, or activities, including delete them. Only goal creators or users who are specifically given&nbsp;Manage permissions to a goal can manage a goal. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

* You can share the following types of goals with others:

  * A goal you created 
  * A goal created by someone else to which you were given permissions to Manage.

* If you have Manage permissions to a goal, you can change the permissions on the goal for the goal creator. By default, they have&nbsp;Manage permissions when they create the goal, but you can change them to View.
