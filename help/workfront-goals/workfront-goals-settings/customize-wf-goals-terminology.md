# Customize *Adobe Workfront Goals* terminology

Your organization must have the following to use the functionality described in this article:

* A *Pro* or higher [*Adobe Workfront* plan](https://www.workfront.com/plans). 
* An *Adobe Workfront Goals* license in addition to a *Workfront* license.

  Contact your *Workfront* account manager to learn about a *Workfront Goals* license.

  *Workfront Goals* is available only in *the new Adobe Workfront experience*.

For additional information about access to *Workfront Goals*, see

[Requirements to use Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/access-needed-for-wf-goals.md).
The *Workfront administrator* can customize the names of objects in *Workfront Goals* to better match your organization's terminology. For example, your organization might not use the concept of "goals" but they do use the concept of "objectives". Your *Workfront administrator* can replace the name "goal" with "objective" everywhere in *Workfront Goals*.

As a *Workfront administrator*, you can customize the following *Workfront Goals* object names using a layout template and assigning it to *Workfront Goals* users:

* Goal
* Result
* Activity

Customizing *Workfront Goals* terminology is identical to customizing terminology in&nbsp;*Workfront*.

For information about customizing terminology in *Workfront*, see [Customize user interface terminology using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-terminology.md).
