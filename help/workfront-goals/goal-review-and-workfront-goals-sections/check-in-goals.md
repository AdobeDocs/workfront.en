# Check in on goals in *`Adobe Workfront Goals`* {#check-in-on-goals-in-adobe-workfront-goals}

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You must have the following before you can start:



*  A Layout Template that includes the Goals area in the Main&nbsp;Menu.




## Considerations for checking in on goals {#considerations-for-checking-in-on-goals}

Consider the following when checking in on your goals: 



*  *`Workfront Goals`* automatically calculates the progress of a goal when you manually update the progress of the results and activities of the goal. 


  >[!TIP] {type="tip"}
  >
  >You cannot update progress directly on a goal. You must update the progress of activities and results which in turn update the progress of the goal. 


  See also the following articles:&nbsp;

    
    
    * For information about adding activities to goals, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](add-activities-to-goals.md).
    * For information about adding results to goals, see [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](add-results-to-goals.md). 
    * For information about how *`Workfront Goals`* calculates the progress on a goal, see [Calculate goal progress in Adobe Workfront Goals](calculate-goal-progress.md). 
    
    
    

*  You must create goals and activate them before you can check in on them.


  See also the following articles:&nbsp;

    
    
    * For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](create-goals.md).
    *  For information about activating goals, see the [Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](activate-goals.md).
    
    


  >[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
  >
  >You cannot check in on goals that are drafted, closed, or inactive. 



* The first time you or someone else updates the progress of a result or activity on a goal, the goal Progress changes from New and *`Workfront Goals`* starts recording progress and progress status updates on the goal. 




## Check in on goals {#check-in-on-goals}

You can check in on goals at the individual goal level, or you can check in on multiple goals from the *`Check-in`* section of *`Workfront Goals`*.
