## Prerequisites

You must have the following before you can start:

## Considerations for checking in on goals

Consider the following when checking in on your goals:

<ul> 
 <li> <p><em>Workfront Goals</em> automatically calculates the progress of a goal when you manually update the progress of the results and activities of the goal. </p> <note type="tip">
   You cannot update progress directly on a goal. You must update the progress of activities and results which in turn update the progress of the goal. 
  </note> <p>See also the following articles:&nbsp;</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>For information about adding activities to goals, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-activities-to-goals.md" class="MCXref xref">Add activities to goals in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront Goals</a>.</li> 
   <li>For information about adding results to goals, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/results-and-activities/add-results-to-goals.md" class="MCXref xref">Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>. </li> 
   <li>For information about how <em>Workfront Goals</em> calculates the progress on a goal, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-management/calculate-goal-progress.md" class="MCXref xref">Calculate goal progress in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>. </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li> <p>You must create goals and activate them before you can check in on them.</p> <p>See also the following articles:&nbsp;</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>For information about creating goals, see <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md" class="MCXref xref">Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>.</li> 
   <li> <p>For information about activating goals, see the <a href="../../workfront-goals/goal-management/activate-goals.md" class="MCXref xref">Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals</a>.</p> </li> 
  </ul> <note type="important">
   You cannot check in on goals that are drafted, closed, or inactive. 
  </note> </li> 
 <li>The first time you or someone else updates the progress of a result or activity on a goal, the goal Progress changes from&nbsp;New and <em>Workfront Goals</em> starts recording progress and progress status updates on the goal. </li> 
</ul>

## Check in on goals

You can check in on goals at the individual goal level, or you can check in on multiple goals from the *Check-in* section of *Workfront Goals*.

* [Check in on individual goals](#check)
