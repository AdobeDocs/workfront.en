# Review graphs to understand goal progress trends in *Adobe Workfront Goals*

You can view the overall health of your goals and their progress trend in time in the Graphs section of *Adobe Workfront Goals*. The charts in this section do not break down the progress of each goal, but instead give you a holistic snapshot of all goals' progress status as well as their progress trend in time during a specified period.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You can see a total count for your goals in the Graphs section for a selected period of time.&nbsp;However, *Workfront Goals* takes into account only goals with a status of Active and Closed when calculating the overall goal progress status and percent complete.
