# Review graphs to understand goal progress trends in `Adobe Workfront Goals`

You can view the overall health of your goals and their progress trend in time in the Graphs section of `Adobe Workfront Goals`. The charts in this section do not break down the progress of each goal, but instead give you a holistic snapshot of all goals' progress status as well as their progress trend in time during a specified period.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You can see a total count for your goals in the Graphs section for a selected period of time. However, `Workfront Goals` takes into account only goals with a status of Active and Closed when calculating the overall goal progress status and percent complete.
