# Review goals in the Adobe Workfront Goals Pulse section

You can view all goals in your organization, regardless of who the owner is. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-management/create-goals.md).

You can use the Pulse section of Adobe Workfront Goals as a collaboration tool, where you can review and participate in a stream of updates about current goals that belong to you, your teams, groups, or organization and ensure that goals stay current. Workfront Goals groups progress updates, comments and editing history by goal in the Pulse section.
