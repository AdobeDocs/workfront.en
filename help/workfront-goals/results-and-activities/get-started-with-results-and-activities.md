# Get started with results and activities in *`Adobe Workfront Goals`* {#get-started-with-results-and-activities-in-adobe-workfront-goals}


Your organization must have the following to use the functionality described in this article: 



*  A *`Pro`* or higher [ *`Adobe Workfront`* plan](https://www.workfront.com/plans). 
*  An *`Adobe Workfront Goals`* license in addition to a *`Workfront`* license.


  Contact your *`Workfront`* account manager to learn about a *`Workfront Goals`* license. 


  *`Workfront Goals`* is available only in *`the new Adobe Workfront experience`*. 



For additional information about access to *`Workfront Goals`*, see [Requirements to use Adobe Workfront Goals](access-needed-for-wf-goals.md).
When you create a goal, the goal has a status of Draft. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](create-goals.md).


In order to start recording progress on a goal, you must activate it. To activate your goal and change its status to Active you must first add the following to it:



* A result
* An activity
* An aligned goal 


After at least one of these items is added, you may activate the goal. You must update the results and activities of goals to indicate progress on the goal. 


>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>A goal cannot have more than a total of 50 activities, results, or aligned goals.


This article gives an overview of activities and results.&nbsp;For information about aligning goals, see [Goal alignment in Adobe Workfront Goals](_goal-alignment.md). 


## Results overview {#results-overview}

Results measure the progress of your goal or how close to achieving it you are. As the goal owner, you can also own the result. A result to your goal might also be assigned to a different user. 


For information about adding results to goals, see [Add results to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](add-results-to-goals.md).


You can add results to your own goals or goals that belong to other entities in your organization.


Consider the following when working with results:



*  They answer the question, “How will I know when my goal is complete?” 
* They are metric indicators. You can select from the following options to indicate a progress for your result:
    
    
    * Currency
    * Number
    * Percentage 
    
    


For more information about results, see the list of similarities between results and activities in the [Similarities between results, activities, and projects](#similarities) section in this article. 


## Activities overview {#activities-overview}

Activities, like results, are specific and measurable, and typically include a percent complete indicator. As the goal owner, you can also own the activities associated with the goal. An activity on your goal might also be assigned to a different user. 


For information about adding activities to goals, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](add-activities-to-goals.md).


Consider the following when associating activities with your goals: 



*  They answer the question, “What will&nbsp;I achieve when the goal is complete?” 
*  You can associate the following activities with goals:

For more information about results and activities, see the list of similarities between results and activities in the [Similarities between results, activities, and projects](#similarities) section in this article. 


## Similarities between results, activities, and projects {#similarities-between-results-activities-and-projects}

Results, activities and projects are goal progress indicators. Although you connect a project to a goal the same way you connect an activity, there are some differences in the way you manage projects versus the way you manage activities. For information about adding projects to goals, see [Add activities to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](add-activities-to-goals.md).&nbsp;For information about projects connected to goals, see [Overview of connecting projects to goals in Adobe Workfront Goals](connect-projects-to-goals-overview.md).


The following table displays similarities and differences between results, activities, and projects, as goal indicators:
