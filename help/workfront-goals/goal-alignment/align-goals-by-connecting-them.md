# Align goals by connecting them in *Adobe Workfront Goals*

If you are an individual contributor who has a personal goal, you may want to align it to your team's goals in order to effectively display the progress of your own goal in the larger context of your organization's strategy.

When everyone in your organization has their goals aligned to your organization's goals, they can clearly see how their individual contributions and team efforts help to move the needle forward on larger, company-level priorities. For more information about the best practices for aligning goals, see [Goal alignment overview in Adobe Workfront Goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/goal-alignment-overview.md).

There are two approaches to connecting goals in&nbsp;*Adobe Workfront Goals*:

* You can create alignment between goals by connecting goals to one another. This is a bottom-up approach to aligning goals.

* You can manually align two goals or you can convert results and activities of an existing goal to another goal.&nbsp;The converted result or activity becomes the child goal of the original goal. This is a top-down approach to aligning goals.

This article describes how you can align goals to one another by connecting them. For information about aligning goals by converting results and activities to goals, see [Align goals by converting results and activities to goals](../../workfront-goals/goal-alignment/align-goals-by-converting-results-activities.md).
