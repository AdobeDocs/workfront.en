# Configure how *`Workfront`* calculates resource hour and FTE&nbsp;availability for the Scheduling area {#configure-how-workfront-calculates-resource-hour-and-fte-availability-for-the-scheduling-area}



>[!NOTE]

>We are no longer developing the Resource Scheduling tools and they will soon be removed from *`Adobe Workfront`*. We recommend that you use the *`Workload Balancer`* for scheduling your resources.

>For information about scheduling resources using the new *`Workload Balancer`*, see the section [The Workload Balancer](_workload-balancer.md).

The *`Adobe Workfront administrator`* determines how *`Workfront`* calculates resource availability and user allocation at the system level (considering hours as well as FTE availability) when they configure Resource Management preferences. 


They can select to use one of the following:



*  The Default Schedule of the system and the user's FTE. 
*  The user's schedule.&nbsp;


For more information, see [Configure Resource Management preferences](configure-resource-mgmt-preferences.md).   



This setting affects user availability in the following circumstances when scheduling resources: 



*  When allowing *`Workfront`* to automatically assign resources, as described in [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

*  When displaying allocation indicators, as described in the section "Allocation indicators" in the article&nbsp; [Manage user allocations in the Scheduling areas](manage-allocations-scheduling-areas.md).
