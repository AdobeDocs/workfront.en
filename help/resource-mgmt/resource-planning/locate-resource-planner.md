# Locate the `Resource Planner` in `Adobe Workfront`

You can use the `Resource Planner` to manage the allocation of your resources to projects. You can access the `Resource Planner` for multiple projects at the same time or for one project, from the project's Business Case area.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Pro</span> and higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Review</span> or higher</p> <p><span>Plan</span> or higher to locate the <span>Resource Planner</span> in the global area</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher to&nbsp;Resource Management</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions to projects and users </p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that all prerequisites for accessing and working with the `Resource Planner` are met before starting to use it. This way, you ensure that the `Resource Planner` displays the correct information before you start budgeting your resources.

For information about `Resource Planner` prerequisites, see [Get started with Resource Planning](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planning.md).

## Locate the `Resource Planner`

You can locate the Planner in two areas of `Workfront`, depending on whether you want to budget your resources for multiple projects, or for just one project.

* [Use the Resource Planner for multiple projects](#access) 
* [Use the Resource Planner for one project](#access2)

### Use the `Resource Planner` for multiple projects

When using the `Resource Planner` for multiple projects, the allocation numbers for your resources represent numbers across multiple projects.

To access the Planner section in the Resourcingarea:

1. Click the Main Menu icon in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront. 
1. Click Resourcing. The Planner displays by default. For information about budgeting resources in the Planner, see the article [Budget resources in the Resource Planner using the Project and Role views](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/budget-resources-project-role-views-resource-planner.md).

1. Hover over the left panel, and click Resource Pools.  
   For information about creating resource pools, see [Create resource pools in Adobe Workfront](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/create-resource-pools.md).

### Use the `Resource Planner` for one project

When using the `Resource Planner` for one project, the allocation numbers for your resources represent numbers for the selected project.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Go to a project you want to budget resources for.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> Click Business Case in the left panel. </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Scroll to the <span class="bold">Resource Budgeting</span> section of the Business Case.</p> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Edit Resource Budgeting</span> to add resource pools to your project and start budgeting your resources. </p> <note type="tip">
   You can only add a resource pool in the Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case when the project has no resource pools associated with it. When the project already has a Resource Pool, the users in the pool and their job roles display in the Resource Budgeting area by default.
