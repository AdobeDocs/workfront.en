# Report on *`Resource Planner`* Budgeted Hours {#report-on-resource-planner-budgeted-hours}

You can budget resources on your projects by using the *`Resource Planner`*. For information about budgeting your resources using the *`Resource Planner`*, see the article [Budget resources in the Resource Planner using the Project and Role views](budget-resources-project-role-views-resource-planner.md).


Budgeting resources means that you define (or budget) a certain number of hours that the resources on a project need to complete their work on the project. To share the budgeted hour information that you enter in the *`Resource Planner`* with other users who might not have access to the *`Resource Planner`*, you can build a Budgdted Hour report. For information, see [Report: Budgeted Hour](report-budgeted-hour.md).
