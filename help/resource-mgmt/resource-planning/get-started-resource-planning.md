# Get started with Resource Planning

You can use the *Adobe Workfront* Resource Management tools to forecast the allocation of your resources so that you know with accuracy whether your projects are delivered on time and on budget. For an overview of Resource Management in *Workfront*, see [Get started with Resource Management](../../resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/get-started-resource-management.md).

You can use resource planning tools to manage your job roles, their availability, and general allocation to projects based on this availability.

Budgeting users' general allocation to projects does not assign them to actual work (tasks and issues). You must assign your resources to work by using the Resource Scheduling tools.

For more information about scheduling resources in *Workfront*, see [Resource Scheduling](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/resource-scheduling-overview.md) .

## Resource planning tools in&nbsp;*Workfront*

To budget time for your resources for the projects you plan to assign them to, you can use the following tools:

<ul> 
 <li> <p>For budgeting allocations for and prioritize multiple projects at the system-level: use the system-level <em>Resource Planner</em>. </p> <p>You can access the <em>Resource Planner</em> by going to the <draft-comment>

## The purpose of the resource planning tools

* Using the *Resource Planner* you can do the following:

  * Prioritize your projects to decide which projects should receive resources first. (Only in the *Resource Planner*)
  * Understand the availability of your resources based on the schedule of your users.
  * Budget hour, FTE, or cost allocations for your resources (users and job roles) for the projects to which they are assigned.

  For information about working in the *Resource Planner*, see the article [Resource Planner overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).

## Create Resource Pools

You can manage your user resources by adding users to Resource Pools. Having users organized in Resource Pools and associating the pools with your projects are prerequisites to Resource Planning.

For information about adding users to Resource Pools and associating them with projects, see [Create resource pools in Adobe Workfront](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/create-resource-pools.md) and [Associate resource pools with users in Adobe Workfront](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/associate-resource-pools-with-users.md).
