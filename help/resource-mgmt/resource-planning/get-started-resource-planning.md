# Get started with Resource Planning  {#get-started-with-resource-planning}

You can use the *`Adobe Workfront`* Resource Management tools to forecast the allocation of your resources so that you know with accuracy whether your projects are delivered on time and on budget. For an overview of Resource Management in *`Workfront`*, see [Get started with Resource Management](get-started-resource-management.md). 


You can use resource planning tools to manage your job roles, their availability, and general allocation to projects based on this availability. 


Budgeting users' general allocation to projects does not assign them to actual work (tasks and issues). You must assign your resources to work by using the Resource Scheduling tools.


For more information about scheduling resources in *`Workfront`*, see [Resource Scheduling](_resource-scheduling-overview.md) . 


## Resource planning tools in  *`Workfront`* {#resource-planning-tools-in-workfront}

To budget time for your resources for the projects you plan to assign them to, you can use the following tools:



*  For budgeting allocations for and prioritize multiple projects at the system-level: use the system-level *`Resource Planner`*. 


  You can access the *`Resource Planner`* by going to the `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Planner section</MadCap:conditionalText>` in the `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Resourcing </MadCap:conditionalText>`area.


  For information about the *`Resource Planner`*, see [Resource Planner overview](get-started-resource-planner.md).

For information about budgeting resources for one project, see the article [Budget resources in the Business Case](budget-resources-in-business-case.md).


  To manage users and organize them in pools based on common skills or departmental structure and then manage their allocations for the projects they are assigned to, you must build Resource Pools.&nbsp;For more information, see [Work with Resource Pools](work-with-resource-pools.md).
