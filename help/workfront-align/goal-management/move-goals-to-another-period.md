# Move goals from one time period to another in `Workfront Align` {#move-goals-from-one-time-period-to-another-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
We recommend that you create goals for quarterly and yearly time periods. For information about creating and activating goals, see the following articles:



* [Create goals in Workfront Align](create-goals.md) 
* [Activate goals in Workfront Align](activate-goals.md) 


After you spend the quarter or the year tracking and updating progress on your goals across the organization, you may find that you cannot yet complete them. 


You cannot move goals from one time period to the next in `Workfront Align`, but you can copy an unfinished goal to a future time period. Some of the goal information transfers to the copied goal, giving you a start for a new time period. For example, you can copy the following information from an existing goal to a copied goal:



* Name
* Description
* Owner
*  Results and their owner




>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>You cannot copy goal or result progress when copying goals. 


For information about copying a goal, see [Copy goals in Workfront Align](copy-goals.md).
