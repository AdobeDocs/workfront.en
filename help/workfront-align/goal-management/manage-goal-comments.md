# Manage goal comments in `Workfront Align` {#manage-goal-comments-in-workfront-align}

Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. `Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).


You can add comments to all goals you can view in  `Workfront Align`. 


You can add comments to goals in the following areas of `Workfront Align`:



* The Goal Details panel
* The `Check-in` section 
* The `Pulse` section


Although the process for adding comments to goals is similar in these areas, there are differences in being able to edit, delete, or react to a comment when using one area versus another. When you enter a comment in any of these areas, the comment is visible in all areas where goal comments display.
