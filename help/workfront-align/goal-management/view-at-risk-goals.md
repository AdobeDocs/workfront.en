## Recommendations for reviewing At Risk goals {#recommendations-for-reviewing-at-risk-goals}

When reviewing at risk goals, we recommend the following: 



* Review at risk goals that are assigned to you as well as organizational goals that are assigned to your teams, groups or to your organization which might be affected by the progress of your goals. You can review goals in any section of `Workfront Align` where a list of goals displays. For information about the `Workfront Align` sections, see [Overview of the Workfront Align sections](overview-of-wf-align-sections.md). This article describes how to review goals in the `Goal List`. 

* Review at-risk goals in the `Goal List` if you need to review goals that belong to your teams, groups, or to your organization. 
*  Review at-risk goals in the `Check-in` section if you want to review just goals where you are the owner and check them in to update their progress.&nbsp;For information about checking in on goals, see [Check in on goals in Workfront Align](check-in-goals.md).
