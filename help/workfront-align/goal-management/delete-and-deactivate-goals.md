# Delete and deactivate goals in `Workfront Align` {#delete-and-deactivate-goals-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
When you start working on a goal and it becomes irrelevant in your organization, we recommend deactivating it, instead of deleting it. Deactivating a goal keeps its historical information and gives you a chance to reactivate it at a later time. There are times, however, when deleting a goal might make sense, to keep your goal list accurate.

## Deactivate goals {#deactivate-goals}

You can deactivate a goal that is no longer relevant and that you might want to reactivate in the future.

    * The `Check-in` section. For information about the Check-in page, see [Check in on goals in Workfront Align](check-in-goals.md). 
    
    * The Graphs section. For information about `Workfront Align` graphs, see [Review graphs to understand goal progress trends in Workfront Align](review-goal-graphs.md).
    
    * The `Goal Alignment section`. For information about the Goal Alignment chart, see [Navigate the Goal Alignment chart in Workfront Align](navigate-goal-alignment-chart.md).
