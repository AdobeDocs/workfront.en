## Filters and tabs in `Workfront Align` {#filters-and-tabs-in-workfront-align}

You can filter information in `Workfront Align` to view only goals that are important to you. You can do so by using a combination of pre-filtered tabs and manual filters that you can select and apply yourself. Once you select a tab and you modify the available filters, the information displayed is limited only to your specifications for all of the following `Workfront Align` sections: 



* `Goal List` 
* Graphs 
* `Pulse` 


You can customize a limited set of filters and have access to a limited set of tabs in the `Goal Alignment` section. 


## Select tabs and customize filters  {#select-tabs-and-customize-filters}

Customizing filters and selecting tabs is identical in all the sections of `Workfront Align` that have them.
