Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
Whether you are a CEO, a manager, or an individual contributor, you can create goals in `Workfront Align` to align your work with your goals and the goals that outline the strategy of your organization.


Any active user in `Workfront` can create a goal in `Workfront Align`, but your  `Workfront administrator` must give you access to `Workfront Align`. For information about the correct access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).


## Guidelines for creating goals {#guidelines-for-creating-goals}

Before starting with `Workfront Align`, we recommend that you read about our best practice recommendations and guidelines for managing goals effectively. For more information about guidelines for creating and managing goals, see [Workfront Align overview](wf-align-overview.md).


## Create goals {#create-goals}

This article describes how you create a goal in  `Workfront Align`. 


A newly created goal is in the status of Draft. To make it part of your strategy, you must also activate it. To activate a goal, you must add a progress indicator to it. This shows, over time, how close you are to achieving it. For information about activating goals, see [Activate goals in Workfront Align](activate-goals.md). 


You can create a new goal in one of the following ways: 



* [Create a goal from scratch](#create2) 
* [Copy an existing goal](#copy) 
* [Convert a result or activity to a goal](#convert) 




### Create a goal from scratch {#create-a-goal-from-scratch}




1.   Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner, then click **Align**. 


   ![](assets/main-menu-align-icon-highlighted-600x899.png)




   The Personal tab on the `Goal List` displays. Here, you can view goals you are the owner of. 

1.  (Recommended) Click the **My Teams**, **My Groups**, or the **Company** tab and identify organization-level goals that your goals should align with and make a note of them.
1.  (Conditional) Click `Goal List`, **Graphs**, `Pulse`,or `Check-in` in the left pane, then click&nbsp;**Add Goal**. 
1. Start typing what you want to achieve in the **Goal** field. This is the name of the goal and a required field. 
1.  Select a time period when the goal should be executed in the **Period** drop-down menu. This is a prefilled field. The default is the current quarter. 


   Select from the following predefined options:

    
    
    * The current year
    * The quarters of the current year
    * The next two years
    * The quarters of the next two years
    
    
   Or


   Click **Define custom dates** to select a custom timeframe. 

1.  (Conditional) Select a **Start date** and an **End date** for your goal, if you clicked **Define custom dates**. 

   ` `**Tips: **`` 
    
    
    * You cannot create a goal with an end date in the past. 
    * When defining custom dates, they are constrained by the initial date you selected. So if you select quarter and then custom dates, you can't go beyond that quarter.
    
    

1.  (Optional) Click **Reset custom dates** to return to the predefined options. 


   >[!TIP] {type="tip"}
   >
   >We recommend that everyone in your organization selects the same timeframes for similar goals or goals that are aligned. This provides better alignment between goals and ensures that everyone's work supports your over-arching strategy. 



1. (Optional) Click your name in the **Owner** field, if you want to indicate someone else as the owner of the goal. By default, you are the owner of goals you create. 
1. Start typing the name of a user, team, group, or the name of your organization in the **Owner** field, then select it when it displays in the list. You can have only one owner for a goal. 
1. (Optional) Enter a **Description** for the goal. This field is optional. 
1.  (Optional) Select **and create new**, then click **Save** to save the goal and start creating a new one.


   Or 


   Click **Save** to save the goal without starting to create a new one. 


   The status of the new goal is Draft.
