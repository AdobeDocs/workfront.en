# Activate goals in  `Workfront Align` {#activate-goals-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
When you create a goal, `Workfront Align` saves it with a status of Draft. Drafted goals are not part of goal management. You must activate your goals which sets their status to Active in order to show progress on them and define how they align with the overall strategy of the organization. For information about creating a goal, see [Create goals in Workfront Align](create-goals.md).


## Overview of activating goals {#overview-of-activating-goals}

To keep track of how close you are to achieving a goal, you must activate it. This changes its status to Active. This requires that the goal is associated with a progress indicator like an activity, result, or it is aligned to another active goal.


You can do one or several of the following to enable activating a goal:



*  Add a Result


  For information about adding results, see [Add results to goals in Workfront Align](add-results-to-goals.md).

*  Add an Activity


  For information about adding activities, see [Add activities to goals in Workfront Align](add-activities-to-goals.md). 

*  Align another goal to it


  For information about aligning goals, see [Align goals by connecting them in Workfront Align](align-goals-by-connecting-them.md).
