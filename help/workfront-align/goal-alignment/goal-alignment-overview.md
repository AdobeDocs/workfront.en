# Goal alignment overview in `Workfront Align` {#goal-alignment-overview-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
Goal alignment is an important part of goal management. You can ensure everyone in your organization is on the same page about what must be achieved to drive strategy forward by aligning their goals to each other and to the organizational goals of teams, groups, and the company. 


After the top level goals have been established and reviewed, it will be up to direct reports and team members to create goals that cascade from that level in order to set more focused goals. The scope of these goals will be more narrow. Considering the designated responsible individual for the goal and their scope of influence, the goal should answer the question of what they and their team must achieve to fulfill the parent goal to which it is aligned.


For more information about best practices when aligning goals, see [Getting started with Workfront Align](getting-started-with-wf-align.md).


## Considerations for aligning goals {#considerations-for-aligning-goals}




* A goal cannot contribute to more than one other goal at the same time. Although you can have multiple children goals aligned to the same parent goal, a child goal you can only have one parent. For information about parent and children goals, see the [Understand parent and children goals](#parent) section in this article.
*  A goal can have several aligned goals, as well as several activities and results. In addition, each child goal can have other activities and results that influence its progress as well as the progress of the parent goal.

* As an individual contributor, we recommend that you contribute to your own goals which should be aligned to team, group, and company-level goals. Updating your own goals should update the progress on all other parent goals. 
* As a CEO or business manager, we recommend that you contribute to your goals, as well as update those assigned to teams, groups, and the company. 




## Types of goal alignment {#types-of-goal-alignment}

There are two approaches for aligning goals:



* **A bottom-up alignment**: You can directly connect a child goal to a parent goal. For information about bottom-up goal alignment, see [Align goals by connecting them in Workfront Align](align-goals-by-connecting-them.md).

* **A top-down alignment**: You can convert a result or an activity of a goal into another goal.&nbsp;The new goal becomes the child goal of the original goal which becomes the parent. For information about top-down goal alignment, see [Align goals by converting results and activities to goals in Workfront Align](align-goals-by-converting-results-activities.md).



For information about parent and children goals, see the [Understand parent and children goals](#parent) section in this article.


## Understand parent and children goals {#understand-parent-and-children-goals}

When you align goals to one another, one goal becomes the parent goal and the other the child goal. The progress of children goals influences the progress of the parent goals. 


Consider the following when working with children and parent goals:



* The following time period restrictions exist: 
    
    
    * You can align goals that only belong to the same or to a future time period.

      >The child goal must end earlier or on the same day as the parent goal. 
    
    
    
    * You cannot align a goal to a past goal. 
    * You can align a quarterly goal to an annual goal, but not a yearly goal to a quarterly goal. 
    
    
* You can align multiple children goals to the same parent goal. 
* One child goal can only have one parent goal. 
* The progress of the children goals indicated by their results and activities influences the progress of the parent goal. Other activities or results associated with the parent goal also influence the progress of the parent goal. 
*  You cannot update the progress of a child goal at the parent goal's level. You must check in on the child goal and this updates the progress of the child as well as that of the parent goal. 


  For information about checking in on goals, see [Check in on goals in Workfront Align](check-in-goals.md).

* After you align goals, the children goals display as progress indicators everywhere the parent goals display:
    
    
    * The Goal&nbsp;Details panel
    * `Goal List`
    * `Goal Alignment section`
    * `Check-in` section
    * `Pulse` section
