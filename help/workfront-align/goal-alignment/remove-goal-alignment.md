# Remove goal alignment in  `Workfront Align` {#remove-goal-alignment-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
You can remove the alignment between two goals if it no longer makes sense for them to be connected.


For information about aligning goals, see the following articles:



* [Align goals by connecting them in Workfront Align](align-goals-by-connecting-them.md) 
* [Align goals by converting results and activities to goals in Workfront Align](align-goals-by-converting-results-activities.md) 


Consider the following when removing alignment between two goals:



* The parent goal must have another goal, activity, or result associated with it to be able to stay Active.
* You cannot remove an aligned child goal from a parent goal if it is the only progress indicator of the parent goal. 
* The child goal becomes a standalone goal when you remove its alignment to the parent goal. 


To remove goal alignment between two goals:



1. Go to a parent goal that has a child goal aligned to it. 
1. Click the goal name to open the **Goal&nbsp;Details** panel. 
1. Click the right-pointing arrow next to **Aligned to** to display the parent goal.
1.  Click&nbsp;**Edit alignment** >&nbsp;**Remove alignment** >&nbsp;**Save**.

   The goal becomes a standalone goal and its progress no longer influences the progress of the original parent goal. 

1.  (Optional)&nbsp;Add activities and results to either goals to indicate their progress. For information about adding activities and results, see the following articles:

    * [Add results to goals in Workfront Align](add-results-to-goals.md)
