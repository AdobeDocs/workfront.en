Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
`Workfront Align` comes with a set of predefined event notifications that you can enable for your account. These event notifications trigger email communication every time the condition defined by the event is met. 


All users that have the correct access to  `Workfront Align` are eligible to receive email notifications about their goals. 


## Overview of `Workfront Align` notifications settings {#overview-of-workfront-align-notifications-settings}

Consider the following when configuring and receiving `Workfront Align` notifications:



* They are personal notifications which means that each user can manage their own notifications.
* The `Workfront administrator` does not need to enable event notifications before each user can select which ones they want to receive. 
* They trigger as soon as the defined events happen on goals, activities, or results and cannot be part of a daily digest. 
* They trigger regardless of the status of the goal. 
* They do not trigger when you are the initiator of the event described in the notification setting.
