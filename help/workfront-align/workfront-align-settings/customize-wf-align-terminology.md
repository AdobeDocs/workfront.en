Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
You can customize the names of objects in `Workfront Align` to better match your organization's terminology. For example, maybe your organization does not use the concept of "goals" but they do use the concept of "objectives". Your `Workfront administrator` can replace the name "goal" with "objective" everywhere in `Workfront Align`. 


As a `Workfront administrator`, you can customize the following `Workfront Align` object names using a layout template and assigning it to `Workfront Align` users: 



* Goal
* Result
* Activity


Customizing `Workfront Align` terminology is identical to customizing terminology in  `Workfront`.
