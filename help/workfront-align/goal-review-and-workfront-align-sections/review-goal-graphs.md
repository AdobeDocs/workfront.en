# Review graphs to understand goal progress trends in `Workfront Align` {#review-graphs-to-understand-goal-progress-trends-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
You can view the overall health of your goals and their progress trend in time in the Graphs section of `Workfront Align`. The charts in this section do not break down the progress of each goal, but instead give you a holistic snapshot of all goals' progress status as well as their progress trend in time during a specified period. 


>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>You can see a total count for your goals in the Graphs section for a selected period of time. However, `Workfront Align` takes into account only goals with a status of Active and Closed when calculating the overall goal progress status and percent complete. 




## Overview of `Workfront Align` graphs {#overview-of-workfront-align-graphs}
