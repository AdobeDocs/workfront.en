# Manage goals in the `Workfront Align` `Goal List` {#manage-goals-in-the-workfront-align-goal-list}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
You can view all goals in your organization, regardless of who the owner is. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Workfront Align](create-goals.md).


You can view and manage goals in the following sections of `Workfront Align`:



* `Goal List` 
* `Goal Alignment` 
* `Pulse` 
* `Check-in` 


Each section displays goals in slightly different formats. Which section you use depends on the purpose you want to achieve as you are working with goals.


You can use the `Goal List` to manage goals that you, your teams, groups, or organization own. 


For more information, see the section " `Goal List`" in the article [Overview of the Workfront Align sections](overview-of-wf-align-sections.md). 


To manage goals in the `Goal List`:
