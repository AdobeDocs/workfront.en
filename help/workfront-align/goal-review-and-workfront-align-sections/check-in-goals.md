# Check in on goals in `Workfront Align` {#check-in-on-goals-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
You must review your goals periodically and update their progress to ensure that they are not falling behind or become in danger of not being achieved. You update the progress of your goals by providing a check-in for them. 


## Considerations for checking in on goals {#considerations-for-checking-in-on-goals}

Consider the following when checking in on your goals: 



*  `Workfront Align` automatically calculates the progress of a goal when you manually update the progress of the results and activities of the goal. 


  >[!TIP] {type="tip"}
  >
  >You cannot update progress directly on a goal. You must update the progress of activities and results which in turn update the progress of the goal.

  >You cannot check in on goals that are drafted, closed, or inactive. 



* The first time you or someone else updates the progress of a result or activity on a goal, the goal Progress changes from New and `Workfront Align` starts recording progress and progress status updates on the goal.
