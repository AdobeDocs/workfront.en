# Review goals in the `Workfront Align` `Pulse` section {#review-goals-in-the-workfront-align-pulse-section}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
You can view all goals in your organization, regardless of who the owner is. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Workfront Align](create-goals.md).


You can use the `Pulse` section of `Workfront Align` as a collaboration tool, where you can review and participate in a stream of updates about current goals that belong to you, your teams, groups, or organization and ensure that goals stay current. `Workfront Align` groups progress updates, comments and editing history by goal in the `Pulse` section. 


To manage goal updates and comments in the `Pulse` section:&nbsp;



1.  Click the **Main Menu icon** ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of your screen, then click **Align**.


   This opens the `Workfront Align` area. 


   The Personal tab in the `Goal List` section displays by default.

1. Click `Pulse` in the left panel. 
1.  (Optional)&nbsp;Click one of the tabs in the table below to view the following types of goals: 


   A list of goals displays. The list contains the following columns with information about each goal:
