# Add results to goals in `Workfront Align` {#add-results-to-goals-in-workfront-align}


Your company must have a `Workfront Align` license in addition to a `Workfront` license to use this functionality. Contact your `Workfront` account manager to learn about a `Workfront Align` license. 


`Workfront Align` is available only in `the new Workfront experience`. 


For additional information about access to `Workfront Align`, see [Access needed to use Workfront Align](access-needed-for-wf-align.md).
Results measure the progress of a goal. Without associating results, activities, or aligned goals to a goal, you cannot activate the goal and you cannot record progress on it. For information about creating goals, see [Create goals in Workfront Align](create-goals.md).


>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}

>A goal cannot have more than a total of 50 activities, results, or aligned goals.


For more information about results, see [Get started with results and activities in Workfront Align](get-started-with-results-and-activities.md).


To add a result to a goal:



1. Go to the goal for which you want to add a result and click the name to open the **Goal&nbsp;Details** panel.

1. Start typing the result you want to achieve in the **Result** field. This is the name of the result and it displays wherever the goal displays. 
1.  (Optional) If you want to set the Result Owner as someone other than yourself, click your name in the **Owner** field and start typing the name of the user that you want to assign as the owner of the result, then click it when it appears in the drop-down list.


   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You cannot assign a team or group as a result owner.



1.  In the **Measured Value** drop-down menu, select the value that you want to measure your success by. Select from the following options:

   For example, if you want to increase profit to 8%, and profit is currently at 4%, you can select % as the Measured Value.

   >The result Type is always Metric and cannot be edited. 




1. In the **Starting At** field, indicate the value that the result starts in the beginning, before any progress on it has been recorded. For example, if you want to increase profit to 8%, and profit is currently at 4%, you can enter 4 as the Starting At value. 
1. In the **Ending At** field, indicate the value that the result aims to achieve. For example, if you want to increase profit to 8%, and profit is currently at 4%, you can enter 8 as the Ending At value.
1.  Click **Save**.


   The result is saved for the selected goal. The progress of the goal automatically updates when you update the progress of a result.
