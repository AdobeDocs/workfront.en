# Use the Home Calendar view

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

You can use the Calendar view in the Home area to manage your work day and work assignments. Only you can view and manage your Home Calendar.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* This is different from a `Adobe Workfront` Calendar report, which is a dynamic report that provides a visual representation of your work. For information about the `Workfront` Calendar report, see [Calendar reports overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/calendars/calendar-reports-overview.md).
>
>* Due to a temporary problem, your `Workfront` Calendar data might not display as described in this article. This problem will be fixed in the near future.&nbsp;
>

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Work</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Tasks and Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Contribute permissions or higher to the tasks and issues you want to add to the calendar</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Schedule work items in your Home Calendar

You can use the Home Calendar to schedule work items for your week.

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;Placing a&nbsp;work item on your Home Calendar does not change the existing dates associated with the work item.

To add a `Workfront` work item to your calendar:

1. Go to the Home Calendar view, as explained in [View the Home Calendar](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/view-home-calendar.md).

   All the work items assigned to you or your groups, teams, or job roles display in the left panel. You can sort the list and filter it to display only certain items.

   For more information, see [Filter and sort work items](#filtering-and-sorting-work-items)&nbsp;later in this article.

1. From the left panel, drag the work item to the day and time when you want to work on it.

   If you schedule yourself to work on an item after its planned completion date or for more time than the number of hours it's planned for, the work item displays in red and a warning appears.

   To learn about work item due dates and how they affect allocated time in the Home Calendar, see&nbsp; [Home Calendar view](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/home-calendar-view.md).

1. Do any of the following:

  * `To schedule a work item for multiple days:` Repeat step 2 to add the item to each day and time when you want to work on it.
  * `To modify the duration of a calendar item:`&nbsp;Hover over the bottom edge of the item until the cursor becomes a double arrow, then drag the bottom edge to the ending time you want.
  * `To delete a calendar item:` Hover over the item, then click the trashcan icon that is displayed.

## Update a work item on your Home Calendar

You&nbsp;can make updates to work items that display in Home Calendar view. Your updates also appear on the Updates tab of the actual work item.
