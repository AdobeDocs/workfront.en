`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">  Main Menu</MadCap:conditionalText>` of a Reviewer

As a Reviewer, your main responsibility is to review, comment on, and approve work. The areas that are visible to you in the

`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Main Menu</MadCap:conditionalText>` allow you to do that.

The following areas are included in the default layout of a Reviewer:

<ul> 
 <li> <draft-comment>
   <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"><span class="bold">Home</span>: In the Production environment, this is the landing page for Review users. You only see information about work you have to review, comment on, or approve. This is the default landing area for a Reviewer, however, it doesn't appear in the Main Menu unless a <em>Workfront administrator</em> adds it in the layout template.</p>
