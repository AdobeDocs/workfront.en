# Understand a Worker's `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Main Menu</MadCap:conditionalText>` in  *`Adobe Workfront`* {#understand-a-workers-main-menu-in-adobe-workfront}

The `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Main Menu</MadCap:conditionalText>` changes with the access level you have been assigned by your *`Adobe Workfront administrator`*. By default, you are given access only to the areas that include functionality allowed by your access level. To understand the components of the default layout of each access level, see [About the default Adobe Workfront layout](about-the default-wf-layout.md).


## Understand the default `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Main Menu</MadCap:conditionalText>` of a Worker {#understand-the-default-main-menu-of-a-worker}

As a Worker, your main responsibility is to complete work. The areas in the `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Main Menu</MadCap:conditionalText>` that are visible to you allow you to do that.


The following areas are included in the default layout of a Worker:



* `Home`: Tasks and issues assigned to you display here. This is the default landing page for a Worker`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> , however, it doesn't appear in the Main Menu unless a  <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.AdminWF variable varname">Workfront administrator</span> adds it in the layout template</MadCap:conditionalText>`.

* `Projects`: Projects that are shared with you display here.
* `Report` `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> s</MadCap:conditionalText>`: Reports that are shared with you display here.

* `Dashboards`:&nbsp;Dashboards that are shared with you display here.
* `Calendars`: Calendars that are shared with you display here.
* `Teams`: Tasks and issues assigned to your teams display in this area. As a Worker, you are the only *`Workfront`* user who sees the Teams area by default.

* `Requests`: You can submit requests and review requests you or your team members have submitted here.
* `Timesheet` `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> s</MadCap:conditionalText>`: You can access your current, future, or old timesheets here.
