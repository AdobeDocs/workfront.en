# Understand a Worker's Main Menu in  `Adobe Workfront`

The Main Menu changes with the access level you have been assigned by your `Adobe Workfront administrator`. By default, you are given access only to the areas that include functionality allowed by your access level. To understand the components of the default layout of each access level, see [About the default Adobe Workfront layout](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/about-the-default-wf-layout.md).

## Understand the default Main Menu of a Worker

As a Worker, your main responsibility is to complete work. The areas in the Main Menu that are visible to you allow you to do that.

The following areas are included in the default layout of a Worker:

* `Home`: Tasks and issues assigned to you display here. This is the default landing page for a Worker, however, it doesn't appear in the Main Menu unless a Workfront administrator adds it in the layout template.
* `Report` s: Reports that are shared with you display here.
* `Teams`: Tasks and issues assigned to your teams display in this area. As a Worker, you are the only `Workfront` user who sees the Teams area by default.

  <!--
  This area is named " Users " for users with a Plan license. As a Worker, you cannot edit users, so the Users area is not available to you. You can see the work assigned to your Teams, however, and this is why this area is more accurately renamed to "Teams."
  -->

* `Requests`: You can submit requests and review requests you or your team members have submitted here.
* `Timesheet` s: You can access your current, future, or old timesheets here.
* `Documents`: You can upload documents, or review documents shared with you, here.

## Customize your default Main Menu

You can customize the areas that you see in yourMain Menu by removing or adding areas.

For more information about customizing the Main Menu, see [Customize the Main Menu in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/customize-global-navigation-bar.md).

Your `Workfront administrator` can also modify your `Workfront` default layout by assigning you a Layout Template. For more information about working with Layout Templates, see Customize the Main Menu using a layout template.
