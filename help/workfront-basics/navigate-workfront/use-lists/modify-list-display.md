# Modify how a list displays

In *Adobe Workfront*, you can customize how a list displays for you. Other users who view the list do not see your changes.

You can make the following customizations:

* The number of items that display
* Column width or order
* Whether groupings are expanded or collapsed

>[!NOTE]
>
>The above display changes you make are reverted when you log out of *Workfront* or close your browser. These changes might also be reverted after a period of 8 hours.

In addition to the temporary customizations above, you can also adjust which columns the list sorts by, which *Workfront* retains even after you log out or close your browser. However, if someone edits the sorting options in a list's view, the previous sorting selection is not retained.

For information on modifying the information that displays in your list, see [Reporting elements: filters, views, and groupings](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/reporting-elements-filters-views-groupings.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

   <p>For the best performance in large lists where objects contain formatted text fields, we recommend limiting this number to 250.</p>

 <li value="6"> <p>To adjust the sorting order of a list, click a column header to select it, then press and hold the CMD key (on Mac) or the CTRL key (on Windows) on your keyboard and select up to 2 additional column headers to sort by them.</p> <p>The list is sorted by each of the selected columns in the order of your selection.</p> <p>All modifications you make to the list save instantly.</p> <note type="note">
   If you are sorting groups in the Groups area in Setup, the hierarchy view of groups and their subgroups does not break up when you change the way the list is sortedâ€”subgroups stay with their parent groups. The list is sorted by top-level groups first. Then, under each parent group, the list of subgroups that are on the same level are sorted together.
