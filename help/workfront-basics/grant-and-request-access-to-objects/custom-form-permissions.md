Your `Workfront administrator` grants each user administrative access to the Custom Forms that are shared with the user's assigned groups.


If you create a Custom Form or have access to share it, you can share it in the following ways: 



*  **With a group**: This gives members of the group access to edit the Custom Form if they have **Custom Forms in my group** enabled in their access level. For more information, see [Assign users administrative access](assign-users-administrative-access.md).


  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >When you create a Custom Form, it is shared automatically with your Home Group.



* **With people, roles, teams, and companies**:&nbsp;This gives your recipients access to attach the Custom Form to objects and use it.


You cannot grant permissions to a user that are higher than the user's access level. 


For instructions on sharing a Custom Form, see [Share a Custom Form](share-a-custom-form.md).
