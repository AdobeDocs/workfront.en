# View inherited permissions on objects in `Adobe Workfront`

Your `Adobe Workfront administrator` can grant you access to view or edit objects when assigning your access level. For more information, see [Grant access to projects](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-projects.md).

Along with the access level that users are granted, you can also grant them permissions to specific objects that you have access to share. For more information about access levels and permissions, see [How access levels and permissions work together](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/how-access-levels-permissions-work-together.md).

Objects inherit permissions from parent objects in  `Adobe Workfront`.

For information about the hierarchy of objects in `Workfront`, see [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/understand-objects.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Work</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher access on the objects you want to view permissions for</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher permissions on the objects you want to view permissions for</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## View inherited permissions for an object

Viewing inherited permissions is identical for all objects.

To view inherited permissions for a project:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to a project whose sharing permissions you want to view. </li> 
 <li value="2"> Click the More menu , then click Sharing. </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Expand the <span class="bold">Inherited Permissions</span> list. </p> <p>This list displays the names of users that have access to either the portfolio or the program that the project belongs to and also have permissions to the project. </p> <p>  </p> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>(Optional) To remove inherited permissions from an object, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/remove-permissions-from-objects.md" class="MCXref xref">Remove permissions from objects in Adobe Workfront</a>. </p> <note type="note">
   You must have Manage permissions on an object to remove the inherited permissions. 
  </note> </li> 
</ol>
