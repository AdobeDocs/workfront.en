# Portfolio permissions {#portfolio-permissions}

Your `Workfront administrator` can grant you access to view or edit Portfolios when assigning your access level. You must have a Plan license to have access to edit a Portfolio. For more information, see [Grant access to portfolios](grant-access-portfolios.md).


Portfolio access controls both access to  `Portfolios` and `Programs`.


Along with the access level that you are granted, you can also receive permissions to view or manage specific Portfolios or Programs from users who can share them with you.&nbsp;


>[!NOTE]
>
>Permission levels work within access levels. For example, you cannot receive permissions to manage a portfolio, if your access level only allows you to view portfolios.


Permissions are specific to one item in `Workfront` and define which actions users can take on that item.  



The creator of a Portfolio or a Program has Manage permissions to it, by default.


## About sharing a Portfolio {#about-sharing-a-portfolio}

Consider the following when sharing a Portfolio or Program:



* Sharing a Portfolio is identical to sharing a Program.  
*  You can share Portfolios individually, or you can share several of them at a time.


  For more information about sharing items in `Workfront`, see [Share Permissions on objects](sharing-permissions-on-objects.md).

*  You can only grant View or Manage permissions on Portfolios and Programs.  

*  When you share a Portfolio or a Program, users inherit the same permissions to all the children objects associated with the Portfolio or Program, by default.  



  For more information about the hierarchy of objects in `Workfront`, see [Understand objects](understand-objects.md).  


* You can remove inherited permissions from the Portfolio and the Program. For more information about removing permissions from objects, see&nbsp; [Share Permissions on objects](sharing-permissions-on-objects.md).
