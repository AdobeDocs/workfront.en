1.  To adjust access for the user, team, job role, group, or company you just added, click the drop-down menu to the right of the name, then configure one of the following available options and any of its advanced settings:

   <td class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps-BodyA-Column2-MediumGray"> <p>Ability to view and edit the folder and its contents</p> <p>Click <span class="bold">Advanced Settings</span> to specify whether you want to allow users to do the following:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><span class="bold">Delete</span>: Delete the folder and its contents from the system</li>

1. (Optional) Repeat Steps 3-4 to add other names to the list and configure their options.
1.  (Optional) If you want everyone in the system to be able to view the folder and its contents, click the gear icon ![](assets/gear-icon-settings-with-dn-arrow.jpg) in the upper right corner of the sharing box, then click `Make this visible system-wide.`


   If you change your mind, you can, click `Remove system-wide access` (the default option).





## How your recipients access the contents of a folder you share with them {#how-your-recipients-access-the-contents-of-a-folder-you-share-with-them}

Currently (temporarily), when you share a folder, your recipients do not see the folder in their Documents area. However, they can access its documents by running a document report.


For example, if you let your recipients know that you have shared a folder with them, they can run a report with Document as the object type and today's date as an Entry Date filter.


![](assets/share-document-folder-350x223.jpg)




The resulting report will contain the documents in the shared folder. From there, a recipient can view and manage the documents using the sharing permissions that you granted for the folder.


## How inherited permissions work when you share a parent object containing a folder {#how-inherited-permissions-work-when-you-share-a-parent-object-containing-a-folder}

When you share the parent object where a document folder resides, your recipients also get access to the folder:



*  If you grant your recipients View access to the parent object, they have View access to the folder.
*  If you grant your recipients Contribute or Manage access to the parent object, they have Manage access to the folder.
*  If you grant one type of access (View, Contribute, or Manage) to the parent object, and another type to the folder, your recipients have the highest of those two types of access to documents within the folder


  For example, if you share the parent object with View access, and the folder with Manage access, your recipients have Manage to the documents in the folder.

*  After you share a folder, any documents you add to it inherit the sharing permissions that you granted for the folder.
