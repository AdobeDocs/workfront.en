# Share a program in  *`Adobe Workfront`* {#share-a-program-in-adobe-workfront}

Your *`Adobe Workfront administrator`* can grant you access to view or edit programs when assigning your access level. You must have a Plan license to have access to edit a program. For more information, see [Grant access to programs](grant-access-programs.md).


Along with the access level that you are granted, you can also receive permissions to view or manage specific programs from users who can share them with you. For more information about access levels and permissions, see [How access levels and permissions work together](how-access-levels-permissions-work-together.md). 


Permissions are specific to each item in *`Workfront`* and define which actions users can take on that item.

*  When you share a program, users inherit the same permissions to all the children objects associated with the program, by default.  



  For more information about the hierarchy of objects in *`Workfront`*, see [Understand objects in Adobe Workfront](understand-objects.md).  


* You can remove inherited permissions from the program. For more information about removing permissions from objects, see&nbsp; [Remove permissions from objects in Adobe Workfront](remove-permissions-from-objects.md).

The following table displays what permissions you can grant users when allowing them to view or manage a program:
