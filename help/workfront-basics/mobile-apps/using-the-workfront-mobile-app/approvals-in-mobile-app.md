# Approvals in the *`Adobe Workfront`* mobile app {#approvals-in-the-adobe-workfront-mobile-app}

You can manage approvals assigned or delegated to you from the Approvals area in the *`Adobe Workfront`* mobile app. From the approvals area, you can approve:

<table style="width: 100%;"> 
 <col style="width: 166px;"> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Work (Tasks and Issues)</li> 
     <li>Documents</li> 
     <li><span class="mc-variable WFVariables.Proof-UC-plur-n variable varname">Proofs</span> </li> 
    </ul> </td> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Timesheets</li> 
     <li>Access Requests</li> 
    </ul> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
