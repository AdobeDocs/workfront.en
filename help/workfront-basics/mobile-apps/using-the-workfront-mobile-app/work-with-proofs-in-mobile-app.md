# Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app

When a proof is assigned to you for approval, it appears in your list of approvals in the mobile app. You can review the proof directly in the app and make a decision on it. For information about reviewing and approving proofs in Adobe Workfront, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

Your access to review and approve proofs is the same as in Adobe Workfront. For information about licenses and access levels, see [Access to proofing functionality in Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md).

## Open and review a proof

1. Open the proof approval task:

  * Select the proof approval task in the Approvals area of My Work.
