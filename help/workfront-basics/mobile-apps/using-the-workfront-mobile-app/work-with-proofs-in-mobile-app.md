# Review and make decisions on `proofs` in the `Adobe Workfront` mobile app

When a `proof` is assigned to you for approval, it appears in your list of approvals in the mobile app. You can review the `proof` directly in the app and make a decision on it. For information about reviewing and approving proofs in `Adobe Workfront`, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

Your access to review and approve `proofs` is the same as in `Adobe Workfront`. For information about licenses and access levels, see [Access to proofing functionality in Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md).
