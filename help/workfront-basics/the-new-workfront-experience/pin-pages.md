# Pin pages to customize your workspace in the new Adobe Workfront experience

You can pin your most important work in the new Adobe Workfront experience for increased visibility, better organization, and quicker access. Pinned pages are always accessible from the top of any page in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

You might be assigned to a Layout Template that has pages already pinned (as described in [Customize pinned pages using a layout template](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/customize-pinned-pages.md)). Any pages you pin display to the right of any existing pins.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
