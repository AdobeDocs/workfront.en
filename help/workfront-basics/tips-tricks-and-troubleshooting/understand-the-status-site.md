### What is a named vulnerability?

In&nbsp;computer&nbsp;security, a&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce the stability, the security, or the integrity of a system.

Vulnerability researchers and exploit creators name their projects internally to make it easy to reference them (for example, ShellShock, Heartbleed, POODLE, and WannaCry/Petya). When a vulnerability has wide-spread impact these names become public when the vulnerabilities are disclosed.

### How do I view named vulnerabilities identified by Workfront?

1. Go to  [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/), then click `Security`.

## Why is this important?

Any security-aware network administrators should be familiar with the Status site and the named vulnerabilities identified by Workfront.&nbsp;

When large impact vulnerabilities are disclosed it is imperative to ensure your vendors are aware and keep your data protected.

The Status site offers a current log of such vulnerabilities that you can reach at any time, where you can avoid the wait from logging a ticket or reaching out to your account manager to obtain this information.&nbsp; &nbsp;
