# Tag others on updates

When providing update comments on a *Adobe Workfront* object, all users on the project can see the information submitted. However, there may be times when users who are not on the project would benefit from viewing this information. Rather than include those users on the project, you can tag them on the update to share it with them. Tagged users receive an event notification.

>[!NOTE]
>
>An event notification must be enabled in order for a user to receive it. Administrators can enable notifications for the whole system or for a top-level group. A user can also enable and disable individual event notifications in their own user profile. For more information, see the following:
>
>* [Configure event notifications for everyone in the system](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/configure-event-notifications-for-everyone-in-the-system.md).
>* [View and configure event notifications for a group](../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-configure-event-notifications-group.md) 
>* [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).&nbsp;
>

>[!NOTE]
>
>When an issue is converted to a project or task, the updates are copied to the new project or task, but the tagged users are not. To continue the conversation, you must tag the participants again.

For information about adding updates to *Workfront* objects, see [Update work](../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).
