### What Is a Named Vulnerability? {#what-is-a-named-vulnerability}

In&nbsp;computer&nbsp;security, a&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce the stability, the security, or the integrity of a system. 


Vulnerability researchers and exploit creators name their projects internally to make it easy to reference them (for example, ShellShock, Heartbleed, POODLE, and WannaCry/Petya). When a vulnerability has wide-spread impact these names become public when the vulnerabilities are disclosed. 


### How Do I View Named Vulnerabilities Identified by `Workfront`? {#how-do-i-view-named-vulnerabilities-identified-by-workfront}




1. Navigate to&nbsp; [https://wfknownvuln.status.io/](https://wfknownvuln.status.io/).  
   Or  
   Navigate to&nbsp; [https://trust.workfront.com](https://trust.workfront.com), then click **Security**.





## Why Is This important? {#why-is-this-important}

Any security-aware network administrators should be familiar with the Trust Site and the named vulnerabilities identified by `Workfront`.&nbsp; 


When large impact vulnerabilities are disclosed it is imperative to ensure your vendors are aware and keep your data protected. 


The Trust Site offers a current log of such vulnerabilities that you can reach at any time, where you can avoid the wait from logging a ticket or reaching out to your account manager to obtain this information.&nbsp; &nbsp;
