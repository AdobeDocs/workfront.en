# Personal time overview

*Adobe Workfront* is&nbsp;not designed to replicate or replace your existing systems for managing, accruing, and tracking personal time off.

However, it is important to indicate when approved time off happens, because this affects&nbsp;your schedule&nbsp;and impacts the Planned Completion Dates of the tasks you&nbsp;are assigned to.

For example, if you are assigned to a task that is scheduled to take two weeks, and you plan to take three days off during that time, *Workfront* adds three days to the task timeline to account for the time off.

Resource Management tools also use your personal time off to indicate when you are available to be scheduled for work.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Work</em> or higher (to configure your personal time off)</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td>Manager with Edit User access (to make changes to the Time-off calendar of other users)</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.
