title: Configure My Settings
description: Your Adobe Workfront profile contains information about yourself (for example, your name, email address, address, phone number, title, etc). It also contains information about your interactions with Workfront and other users in your company (for example, your notifications settings, the tabs you want to display in Workfront, or your job role, manager and group and team memberships).

# Configure My Settings

Your Adobe Workfront profile contains information about yourself (for example, your name, email address, address, phone number, title, etc). It also contains information about your interactions with Workfront and other users in your company (for example, your notifications settings, the tabs you want to display in Workfront, or your job role, manager and group and team memberships).&nbsp;

Most of this information has already been set by your Workfront administrator when your Workfront account was created.&nbsp;

Depending on what access level you have in Workfront, you can edit some of this information by configuring your My Settings area.

## How access levels affect editing the My Settings area

Depending on what access level you have, you may or may not be able to edit sections&nbsp;in your My Settings area.

Some fields contained in editable sections cannot be edited, depending on other settings that might or might not be configured in&nbsp;your access level. For more information on additional access needed for editing some of the fields you find in My Settings, see the sections in [Configuring the My Settings area](#configuring-my-settings).

To find out what access level you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

The following grid shows what sections in the My Settings area are visible&nbsp;or editable&nbsp;depending on your access level:
