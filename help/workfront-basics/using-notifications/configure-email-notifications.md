# Configure email notifications {#configure-email-notifications}

Your `Workfront administrator` configures which email notifications users receive when events occur in `Workfront` (as described in [Enable and disable event notifications](enable-and-disable-event-notification.md)). You can customize this further by configuring which notifications you receive.


For a complete list of email notifications that you can receive, see [Email notifications](workfront-notifications.md#email-notifications) in [Workfront notifications](workfront-notifications.md).


## Modify your email notification settings {#modify-your-email-notification-settings}

You can specify what types of notifications you want to receive. For a complete list of all notifications available in `Workfront`, see [Workfront notifications](workfront-notifications.md).


>[!NOTE]
>
>If you enable a notification type and then find that you are not receiving notifications of that type, it may be because that notification type does not apply for your role.


You can also choose whether you want to receive notifications as events happen or in one daily digest email (see [Email notifications](email-notifications.md)).

1. Click the **Main Menu** icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of `Workfront`, then click your user name next to your profile picture.

   >If you are a team member for a project, you continue to receive email notifications for it until you are removed from the team, even if you no longer have access to the project.


   For instructions on removing users from a team, see [Remove users from projects](remove-users-from-projects.md).


   For the **Communication** category, you can select individual notifications for instant delivery only. You must select all of the notifications to be delivered in a daily digest.


   If all email notifications for a given category are enabled, the box in the category title appears as selected. If all email notifications in a given category are disabled, the box is unselected. If some notifications are enabled and others are disabled, the category checkbox appears as a straight line.  
   When you modify a notification setting, the label **Edited** appears for that notification setting, to let you know that that notification setting has been modified.   
   For detailed information about each notification item, see [Configure email notifications](#notification-descriptions).

1.  If you selected any notifications to be sent as a daily digest, select the time of the day you want to receive it at the top of the **Notifications** section in the **Email Daily Digest after** menu.   



  



   The daily digest includes events that meet the criteria of the notifications 24 hours prior to the selected time. You receive one daily digest email for each type of notification. For more information about the notification types, see [Configure email notifications](#notification-descriptions).  
   The daily digest may arrive after the time you select, depending on how many emails are queued for delivery in the system. The time listed is your local time as specified in your browser settings.

1. Click **Save Changes**.
