For a list of the work item and announcement notifications you can receive, see [In-app notifications overview](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/in-app-notifications-overview.md).

>* In-app notifications for work activities are not tied to email notifications in Workfront. For more information, see [Adobe Workfront notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/wf-notifications.md)
>* In-app notifications cannot be customized.

>You can view all in-app notifications both from the web application and the mobile&nbsp;application. Only some of these notifications are sent as push notifications in the mobile application. For more information about notifications in the mobile app, see [Adobe Workfront for iOS](../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/workfront-for-ios.md) or [Adobe Workfront for Android](../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/workfront-for-android.md).
