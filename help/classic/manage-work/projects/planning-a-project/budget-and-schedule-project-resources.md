Resource budgeting and scheduling are part of project planning.

Ensure you do the following as you finalize planning for your projects in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront:

* Budget your resources (users and job roles) for your projects. When you budget resources you estimate, at a high level, when and for how long those resources will be used on projects.

  For information, see the following articles:

   * [Resource Planning in Adobe Workfront](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planning-overview.md) 
   * [Get started with the Scenario Planner](../../../scenario-planner/get-started-with-scenario-planning.md)

* Schedule your resources or assign them to tasks and issues. When you assign your resources to tasks and issues you can actually associate users, teams, or roles to specific work items making them responsible for completing these items. .
