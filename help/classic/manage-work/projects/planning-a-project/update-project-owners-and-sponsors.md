# Update project owners and sponsors

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

When you create a project in Adobe Workfront, you are automatically set as the Project&nbsp;Owner of the project. You can update this field with another user. You can also update the Project Sponsor field of a project.

For information about projects owners and sponsors, see [Overview of project owners and sponsors](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-owners-and-sponsors.md).

>[!TIP]
>
>You can identify an owner and a sponsor for a template. When you create a project from that template, the Template Owner becomes the Project Owner and the Template Sponsor becomes the Project Sponsor.&nbsp;For information about editing templates, see [Edit project templates](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/edit-templates.md).
