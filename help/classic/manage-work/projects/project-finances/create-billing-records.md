# Create billing records

In addition to setting up revenue and tracking expenses, you can create billing records on a project for information that needs to be billed.

You cannot create billing records for tasks. You can only create billing records for projects.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td>

## Billing records overview

Billing records are created as attachments to a project and contain financial data from the project as well as some financial information for the tasks in a project.

Consider the following when planning to use billing records:

* You create a billing record when you want to bill an amount of money related to the project to an external vendor or partner. In addition to billing a fixed amount to an external source, there are times when you need to bill out the amount of work on the project (from logged hours) to an external contractor, as well as the expenses incurred or the amount of fixed revenues. You can include all this information in the same billing record.
* Once a billing record is set to Billed it can not be edited.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >This is important when your rates vary and you want to lock the revenue and expense information on your project. Adding it to a billing record and marking it as Billed prevents it from being updated when the rates update in your system.

* A project with billing records that have been marked as Billed cannot be deleted.

## Create a billing record

1. Navigate to a project.
1. Go to **Billing Records** tab.

   Depending on how your Workfront administrator designed your layout, this tab might be located under the **More** tab.

1. In the **New Billing Record** box that displays, specify the following information:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Description</td> 
      <td>This is a required field. Specify a description for the billing record, to reflect the purpose or the intent for this record.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Billing Status</td> 
      <td> <p>Select <strong>Not Billed</strong>, if this record has not been billed yet.</p> <p>Select <strong>Billed</strong> when the billing record is billed.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Billing Date</td> 
      <td>Select the date for when this billing record is billed, by clicking the calendar icon.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">PO Number</td> 
      <td>If there is a PO Number associated with this billing record, specify this information in this field.</td>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Invoice ID</td> 
      <td>If there is an Invoice associated with this billing record, specify this information in this field.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Additional Amount</td> 
      <td>Enter the fixed amount of your billing record. This is the amount you intend to bill an external customer, contractor or partner for this project. This amount cannot be modified after the status of the billing record is changed to Billed.</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

### Include Billable Hours in a billing record

#### **What hours can be added to a billing record**

You can add hours to a billing record when the following conditions are met:

* Tasks, issues, or the project have hours logged. 
* The Hour Type of the hours logged is marked as Count as Revenue.

  For more information about Hour Types, see the article [Manage hour types](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/hour-types.md).

* All hours logged for issues or for the project can be added to a billing record if the user who logs the time has a Billing per Hour rate associated with them or their Primary Job Role. 
* If the hours are logged on a task, the task must have the following Revenue Type:

   * The Revenue Type cannot be set to Not Billable.
   * If the Revenue Type is set to User Hourly, the user who logs the time must have a Billing per Hour rate set in their profile. 
   * If the Revenue Type is set to Role Hourly, the Primary Role of the user who logs the time must have a Billing per Hour rate.

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >You can override billing rates for job roles at the project level.  
     >For more information about overriding job role billing rates, see the section "Overriding Job Role Billing Rates at the Project Level" in the article [Overview of overriding Job Role Billing Rates and calculating Revenue on a project](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/override-role-billing-rates-and-calculate-project-revenue.md).

* If **Require time to be approved for this project** is checked under Project Settings, then the Project Owner must approve the hours logged.
