>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

The Planned Benefit is the estimated amount of money that an organization might benefit from if a project is completed.

The Planned Benefit is not calculated by Adobe Workfront. As the Project Owner, you manually specify the Planned Benefit of a project in the Business Case. We recommend that each organization establish a policy as to how this value is determined.

The Planned Benefit of a project affects the Net Value of a project.  
For more information about calculating the Net Value of a project, see the article [Calculate Net Value](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/calculate-net-value.md).
