# Work in the Legacy Team Builder

>[!NOTE]
>
>The information in this article refers to functionality that is currently deprecated and will be removed in the future.

The Legacy Team Builder provides an interface for creating and managing a project&nbsp;team. By default, the new scheduling area is displayed rather than the team builder. You can disable the new scheduling area for your team and access the legacy Team Builder, as described in [Access the Team Builder](#accessing-the-team-builder).

## Overview of the Team Builder

* [Overview of the Team Builder interface](#understanding-the-team-builder-interface) 
* [Overview of the Team Builder icons](#understanding-team-builder-icons) 
* [Overview of the Preferences icon](#understanding-the-preferences-icon)

### Overview of the Team Builder interface

As a project manager, you can use the Team Builder to assign users to your project. The Team Builder is divided into four major areas:

* User information in the upper-left panel
* User work schedule in the upper-right panel
* Task information in the lower-left panel
* Task schedule in the lower-right panel

### Overview of the Preferences icon

The Preferences icon in the Team Builder allows you to customize your view and makes it easier to assign tasks to users. Within preferences, you can set the fields in the User and Task panels, the information displayed in the Gantt chart and identify the matching features.

When customizing your Team Builder view using Preferences, consider updating the following tabs:&nbsp;

`User Fields:` Controls the information you see in the User panel. This tab allows you to select the fields of information that are displayed about team members and the order the columns appear in. Add a field from the Unused list to the Used list to display it. To reorder the columns, drag and drop the labels into order.  
![](assets/3-350x277.png)

`Task Fields` `:` Controls the information you see in the Task panel. This tab allows you to select the field of information that are displayed about tasks and the order the columns appear in. Add a field from the Unused list to the Used list to display it. To reorder the columns, drag and drop the labels into order.  
![Task_Fields.Team_Builder.png](assets/task-fields.team-builder-350x277.png)

`Chart Indicators:` Identifies the information displayed in the Gantt chart that is located in the Task panel.  
![](assets/4-350x276.png)

`Matching:` Activates the matching feature in Team Builder. When the matching feature is activated, team members who meet the conditions selected are highlighted when a task is selected. Also, when you select a user, the tasks the user can be assigned to are highlighted.

You can match users with a task based on the following criteria:

* `Match on Team Role`: If the task is assigned to a role associated with the user on this project, the task and the user are highlighted in green. To find out the roles associated with a user on a specific project, see the Edit Project User Role icon in the Team Builder.&nbsp;
* `Match on User Role`: If the task is assigned to any role associated with the user in the user profile, the task and the user are highlighted in green.
* `Match on Planned Hours`: If a user is available to work the days and the amount of planned hours associated with the task, the task and the user are highlighted in green.&nbsp;

We recommend that use Match on Planned Hours and Match on User Role. However, depending on the needs of your organization, a different option might be preferable.

## Add users to a Project Team

Users are automatically added to the project team when they are assigned a role on the project. For more information on automatically adding users, see [Project Team overview](../../../manage-work/projects/planning-a-project/project-team-overview.md).&nbsp;

You can manually add users to the project team by using the Team Builder.

To add users to the project team in the Team Builder:

1. Go to the Team Builder as described in [Access the Team Builder](#accessing-the-team-builder).

   Or  
   Click the  `Group` tab in the  `Users` panel to display all the users in the group associated with the project.  
   ![Add_user_tabs.png](assets/add-user-tabs-350x76.png)

1. Click  `Save.`

## Assign users to a Task

You can add users to a task at the task level or in the Team Builder. For more information about adding users at the task level, see the section "Manually assign unassigned tasks or issues to users" in the article [Manually assign unassigned tasks and issues in the Scheduling areas](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/manually-assign-items-scheduling-areas.md).

Before assigning users to a task using the Team Builder, ensure that matching is enabled. For more information about matching, see [Overview of the Preferences icon](#understanding-the-preferences-icon).

To assign users to a task:

1. Go to the Team Builder as described in [Access the Team Builder](#accessing-the-team-builder).
1. In the Tasks panel, select a task or issue. Users who are able to perform the task are highlighted in green in the upper-left panel.
