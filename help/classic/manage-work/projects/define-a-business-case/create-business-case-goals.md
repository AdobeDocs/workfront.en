As part of creating a Business Case, you can create a set of goals to define the objectives of a project. Business Case goals are used to communicate to the Portfolio Manager or the Project Sponsor the purpose of completing a project.

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: below snippet: NWE only, not classic)</p>

Consider the following when creating Business Case goals for your projects:

* Business Case goals are project-specific. You cannot copy goals from one project to another, nor establish goals at the system level. They must be defined at the level of each project. 
* Your Adobe Workfront administrator ```or group administrator``` must enable the Goals section for your projects before it displays in the Business Case of your projects. For information about enabling Business Case fields for projects, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

* Goals are not a mandatory section in the Business Case of a project.

  A project can receive a score to be prioritized in the Portfolio Optimizer, even if the Goals section of the Business Case is not defined.

  For more information about the Portfolio Optimizer score, see [Apply a scorecard to a project and generate an Alignment Score](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/apply-scorecard-to-project-to-generate-alignment-score.md).

* You cannot report on Business&nbsp;Case&nbsp;goals.
