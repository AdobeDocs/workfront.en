# Capacity Planner and Resource Estimates display limits

Currently, the Resource Estimates in the Project Details > Business Case as well as the Capacity Planner in People > Resource Planning > Resource Pools areas have a limit of displaying data for 1095 total days which is equal to 3 years including weekends.

For example, if you have a Project with the Planned Start Date in 1/1/2015 and Planned Completion Date in 12/31/2020 the allocation for it will appear until 1/1/2018 in the Resource Estimates area of the Business Case and in the Capacity Planner.

For information about managing resources in the Resource Estimates area of the Business Case see the article [Estimate project resources by applying Legacy Resource Pools to the Business Case](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/apply-legacy-pools-to-business-case.md).
