The following actions trigger financial recalculation in Workfront:

* Changing task status
* Moving a task with hours to another project
* Changing the project status from Complete to an active status

>[!NOTE]

>When you change the project status, only the planned values are being recalculated.

You can also recalculate finances manually under **Project Actions** by clicking **Recalculate Finance**.
