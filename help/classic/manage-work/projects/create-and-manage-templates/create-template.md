>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

You can create and delete templates from the Projects area. When building a new template, you can enter the information for all of the tasks and all information for your future project settings. This information will then transfer to the project, when you create it from the template.

You can create a new template in the following ways:

* From scratch, as described in this article.
* From existing projects, by saving a project as a template.

  For more information about creating templates from existing projects, see [Save a project as a template](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/save-project-as-template.md).

* By copying it from another template.

  For more information about copying an existing template, see [Copy a project template](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/copy-template.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Templates</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>You have Manage permissions to the templates you create, by default</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Template settings determined by group association

A project template's association with a group (or lack thereof) affects how project, task, and issue preferences determine certain settings in the template. For more information, see the section Create and modify a group’s project templates in the article Create and modify a group’s project templates.
