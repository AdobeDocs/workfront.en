All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

You can edit project templates to reflect changes in project processes and settings.

## Add additional items to a template

After you have created your template and have edited the template information, you can add more items to it. The items you add will be available for the project when you are creating it from the template.

Adding the following items to a template is identical to adding them to a project:

* Documents
* Risks

  For more information about creating risks, see the [Create and edit risks in the Risks area](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-edit-risks-on-projects.md#creating-and-editing-risks-in-the-risks-tab)  section in the article [Create and edit risks on projects](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-edit-risks-on-projects.md).

* Approval processes

  For information about associating approval processes with work, see [Associate a new or existing approval process with work](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/associate-approval-with-work.md).

* Billing Rates

* Expenses

  For more information about adding expenses, see [Manage project expenses](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/manage-project-expenses.md).
