# Overview of attaching a template to a project

When you attach a template to an existing project, you are modifying some of the information on the project according to that of the template. Some of the information on the project remains unchanged.

For information about how to attach a template to a project, see [Attach a template to a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/attach-template-to-project.md).

## Considerations when adding templates to projects

Consider the following when adding templates to projects:

* You can attach only active templates to projects.
* You can attach a template to a project when the project is in a status of Complete, Dead, or in Pending Approval, only when your Adobe Workfront administrator ```or a group administrator``` has enabled this functionality in the Project&nbsp;Preferences area. For information about setting project preferences, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).
* Unless you exclude specific template tasks from being added in the attachment process, all template tasks are added to the existing project.
* Most template settings are added to the project. Some project settings are preserved. For information, see the section [Understand changes to project fields when attaching a template](#understand-changes-to-project-fields-when-attaching-a-template) in this article.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Attaching a template to a project is not the same as creating a project from a template. When you create a project from a template, all template fields transfer to the new project. Attaching a template leaves some of the existing project fields unchanged.

Some template settings automatically transfer to the project, unless you specifically mark them to be excluded during the template attachment process. When you mark them to be excluded, the project field values are preserved.

However, not all project fields are available to manage in the process of attaching a template to a project. For information, see [Attach a template to a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/attach-template-to-project.md).

The following table describes the default for what happens to project fields when you attach a template and which fields you can manage during the attachment process to override the default behavior:
