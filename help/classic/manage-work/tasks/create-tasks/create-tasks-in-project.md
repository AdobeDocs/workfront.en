# Create tasks in a project

You can create tasks in a project only after you created the project.

For example, after creating a project, you might want to add tasks and modify them to organize the project plan. For more information about creating a project, see [Create a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md).

For information about creating personal tasks that are not in a project, see the "Create a personal task" section in the article [Create work items from the Home area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/create-work-items-in-home.md).

This article describes how you create tasks from scratch. You can also create tasks in the following ways:

* By copying or duplicating existing tasks.&nbsp;For information, see [Copy and duplicate tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/copy-and-duplicate-tasks.md).
* By moving tasks from one project to another.&nbsp;For information, see [Move tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/move-tasks.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Contribute permissions to the project with ability to Add Tasks or higher</p> <p>When you create a task you automatically receive Manage permissions to the task</p> <p> For information about task permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-task.md" class="MCXref xref">Share a task in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront</a>. </p> <p>For information on requesting additional permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td>
