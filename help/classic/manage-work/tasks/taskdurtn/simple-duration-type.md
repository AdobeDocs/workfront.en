The Simple Duration Type is a Duration Type that you can set for a task in Adobe Workfront. For general information about Duration Types in Workfront, see [Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type](../../../manage-work/tasks/taskdurtn/task-duration-and-duration-type.md).

## Overview of the Simple Duration Type

Your Workfront ```or a group administrator``` can set the default Duration&nbsp;Type of your system or group as Simple.&nbsp;In this case, all new tasks will be created with this Duration Type. For information about changing your task and issue preferences as part of your system-level or group-level project preferences, see [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).

The following things occur when a task has a Duration Type of Simple:

* Project managers can modify the both the Duration and the Planned Hours of a task when modifying how those hours should be distributed among assignees.

  For information, see [Update the Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type](../../../manage-work/tasks/taskdurtn/update-planned-hours-duration-for-simple-duration-task.md).

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >When you first create a task and assign the Simple Duration&nbsp;Type to it and do not specify a Duration, Workfront calculates the Duration of the task based on the amount of Planned Hours you specify for the task. If you manually modify the Duration of a Simple Duration task, Workfront stops matching the Planned Hours to the Duration because it assumes you want to define them manually yourself.

* Allocation percent is hidden and allocation hours are available to be edited, instead.
* All new customers have the system-level Duration Type set to Simple.
