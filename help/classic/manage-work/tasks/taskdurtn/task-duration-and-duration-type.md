# Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type

>[!IMPORTANT]

>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

The task Duration is the difference between the Planned Completion Date and the Planned Start Date of the task. The Duration indicates the time frame that is available for the task to get completed.

The Duration Type of a task identifies the relationship between the number of resources assigned to a task, the total effort, and the total Duration of the task.

## Task Duration overview

>[!NOTE]
>
>When taking into account the Primary Assignee's time off on a project, the planned dates of the task might adjust, but the Duration of the task remains the same. For information about taking into account the time off of the Primary Assignee when planning a project, see ``` [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md)```.

If the Actual Start and&nbsp;Actual Completion Dates of the task fall outside of the schedule of the project, primary assignee, or the Default Schedule, the task&nbsp;Duration is zero.

**Example:** If you have a schedule that starts at 9:00&nbsp;AM and ends at 12:00&nbsp;PM and a task that is scheduled to start at 2:00 PM and end at 4:00 PM, the task's Duration is zero.

The following are two scenarios that exist when calculating duration in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront.

* If the task is assigned to a user Workfront uses one of the following schedules, in this exact order to calculate Duration:

   1. Workfront takes into account the user's schedule. 
   1. If the user is not associated with a schedule, Workfront takes into account the project's schedule.
   1. If the project is not associated with a schedule, Workfront takes into account the Default Schedule of your system. For information about schedules, see [Create a schedule](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md).

* If the task is assigned to multiple users:

  Workfront takes into account either the schedule of the project or that of the primary assignee.

  Your Workfront administrator determines which schedule Workfront uses when a task is assigned to multiple users. For information, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

  The steps are similar to the first scenario after understanding which schedule Workfront uses to calculate Duration.

## Units of time for Task Duration

You can indicate task&nbsp;Duration in both the regular time and the elapsed time between the Planned Start and Planned Completion Dates.

When updating the Duration of tasks in a list ,Task&nbsp;Details tab, or in the Edit Task box , you can use the following abbreviations for indicating units of time in&nbsp;Workfront: 

| Unit of Time |Abbreviation |
|---|---|
| Minutes |M |
| Hours |H |
| Days.&nbsp;This is the default.  |D |
| Weeks |W |
| Months |T |
| Elapsed Minutes |EM |
| Elapsed Hours |EH |
| Elapsed Days |ED |
| Elapsed Weeks |EW |
| Elapsed Months |ET |

**Example:** If you want to indicate that a task's Duration is 3 Elapsed Day, you would type "3 ED" in the Duration field in a task list  , Task Details tab, or when editing durations in the Edit Task box . For information about editing tasks, see [Edit tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks.md).

Consider the following when indicating the Duration of a task:

* Elapsed time is a unit of time for a task's Duration. It is the time between the Planned Start Date and the Planned Completion Date of a task that includes holidays, weekends, and time off. In other words, elapsed time is the passage of calendar days. 
* Regular time takes into account holidays, weekends, and time off and excludes them from the Duration of the task.

* When you indicate the Duration of a task in weeks, Workfront calculates the Duration in days and hours based on the Typical work days per week and Typical hours per work day settings set by your Workfront administrator in the Project&nbsp;Preferences area of Setup.
* Workfront uses the default duration of 4 weeks for one month when calculating Duration in months.

## Task Duration Type overview

Managing the Duration&nbsp;Type of a task enables you to set consistent resource assignments based on the needs of the task.

Duration Type helps to answer the following questions:

* How busy are we going to be?
* How big is the job?
* How long is it going to take?

## The Duration&nbsp;Type of new tasks

The Duration Type of a new task matches the Duration Type set up in your system. The default Duration Type is Calculated Assignment. Your Workfront administrator ```or a group administrator``` can update the default Duration Type for your system ```or for the group associated with the project```.&nbsp;For information, see [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).

## Change the Duration Type of a task

For information about changing the Duration Type of a task, see [Update the Duration Type of a task](../../../manage-work/tasks/taskdurtn/update-duration-type-of-task.md).
