# Update Task Priority

You can define a priority for a task to indicate how important the task is.

You must have Manage permissions to the task to modify the Priority of the task.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Tasks</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## Overview of task Priorities

Consider the following when using task priorities:

* <![CDATA[			]]>Adobe Workfront administrators can modify priority labels within Workfront or they can create new priorities. As a result, the options you might have for the Priority field in your Workfront instance might differ from those listed below. For information about customizing the names of priorities in your instance, see [Create and customize priorities](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-customize-priorities-.md). 
* Each priority label has a number associated with it that can not be modified.

  You should become familiar with the numbering sequence for priorities used in your organization.

  For example, your organization might use the number 1 to refer to urgent tasks, if the label of the priority has been modified.

  Refer to the following table to understand each default priority label and its corresponding number: 

  | **Priority Label (Can be modified)** |**Priority Number (Cannot be modified)** |
  |---|---|
  |  None  | 0  |
  |  Low  | 1  |
  |  Normal  | 2  |
  |  High  | 3  |
  |  Urgent  | 4  |
