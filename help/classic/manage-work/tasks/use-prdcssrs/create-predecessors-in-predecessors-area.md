# Create a predecessor relationship using the Predecessors area

You can use predecessor tasks (or just predecessors) to link tasks that depend on other tasks to start or complete. For example, you would not want to host a party (dependent task) before you send out the invitations (predecessor task).

This article shows how you can set predecessors using the Predecessors tab within a task.

For information about setting predecessors in a list of tasks, see [Create a predecessor relationship on the task list](../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/create-predecessors-on-task-list.md).

You can view the predecessors of tasks in the following areas of Adobe Workfront:

* In the Predecessors tab of the dependent tasks
* In the Gantt Chart
* In the task list in the Predecessors column

For information about predecessors, see [Overview of task predecessors](../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/predecessors-overview.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Tasks and Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

   For information about task Dependency Types, see a [Overview of task dependency types](../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/task-dependency-types.md).

1. Specify a **Lag** amount in days.

   For information about Lag Types, see â€‹ [Overview of Lag Types](../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/lag-types.md).

1. Select **Enforced** if you want to enforce the predecessor relationship between the two tasks.

   For information about enforcing predecessors, see [Enforce predecessors](../../../manage-work/tasks/use-prdcssrs/enforced-predecessors.md).
