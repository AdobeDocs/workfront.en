Your Workfront administrator must define system-level Approval Processes before you can associate them with issues. Users with administrative access to Approval processes can also create group-specific approval processes.For more information about creating Approval Processes, see Create an approval process for work items. Consider the following when adding approval processes: Only active approval processes display in the list. System-wide and group-specific approval processes display in the list. An approval process associated with a group other than that of the project does not display in the list. Important: If the group of the project changes, the group-specific approval process becomes a single-use approval process. For more information about how changes to the group of the project or changes in the approval process affect approval settings, see How group and approval process changes affect assigned approval processes. If you added a single-use approval process, it displays as "<Custom>" in this field. You can define default approval processes to be automatically attached to issues when creating request queues or Queue Topics. For information about updating Queue Details, see Create a Request Queue. For information about creating Queue Topics, see Create Queue Topics. When bulk-editing issues, the following scenarios exist: When you select multiple issues from the same group, both system-level and group-specific approval processes display in this field. When you select multiple issues from different groups, only system-level approval processes display in this field. When any of the issues have a single-use approval process attached, it is replaced by the system-level or group-level approval process you select.
