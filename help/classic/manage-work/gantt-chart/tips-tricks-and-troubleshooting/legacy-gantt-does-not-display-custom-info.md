## Question

Why can I not see Custom Field data for certain objects in the Legacy Gantt Chart?

## Answer

The Legacy Gantt Chart only displays data from the top Custom Form. The&nbsp;Legacy Gantt chart does not support the functionality of multiple custom forms and does not display custom fields from secondary Custom&nbsp;Forms.&nbsp;
