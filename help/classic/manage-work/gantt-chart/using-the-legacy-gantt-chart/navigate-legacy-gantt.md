# Navigate the Legacy Gantt Chart

>[!NOTE]
>
>The information in this article refers to functionality that is currently deprecated and will be removed in the future.

You can manage the time line of a project using the tab with the Legacy Gantt chart on the project.&nbsp;

In addition to giving you a visual representation of the time line of the project, you can also perform the following actions using the Legacy Gantt Chart:

* Add tasks to a project.
* Update task information (assignments, Planned Start and Completion Dates, percent complete, predecessors).
* Change the structure of your project by reordering, outdenting, or indenting tasks.
* Associate tasks with milestones.&nbsp;
* Understand the daily Planned Hour distribution of the Planned Hours of the tasks.&nbsp;

Most of these editing options&nbsp;are accessible by using&nbsp;the icons in the Legacy Gantt chart. Others are accessible by performing&nbsp;several actions in the grid of the chart or in the chart itself.&nbsp;

## Use the Legacy Gantt Chart to update the project

You can access the Legacy Gantt Chart in various places in the Workfront application.  
For more information about where you can access the Gantt Chart in Workfront, see [View information in the Gantt Chart](../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/view-info-in-gantt.md).

To access the Legacy Gantt in a project and to make update to the project using the Gantt Chart:&nbsp;

1. Navigate to a project for which you want to manage the timeline. 
1. Click **More**, then select the **Legacy Gantt** tab.

1. (Optional) To rearrange the tasks in the project, select a task, drag and drop it in the correct spot. 
1. (Optional) To indent a task, right-click on the task, and click&nbsp;**Indent Task**. 
1. (Optional) To outdent a task, right-click on the task, and click **Outdent Task**. 
1. (Optional) Select multiple tasks by clicking and pressing Shift on your keyboard then clicking several tasks; then, right click and click **Chain**. This creates predecessor relationships between the tasks.&nbsp; 
1. (Optional) By default, you can update the following fields in the grid section&nbsp;of the Legacy Gantt Chart:

   * Name of the task 
   * Duration 
   * Start Date 
   * Completion Date 
   * Assignments 
   * Percent Complete 
   * Predecessors

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >The ability to edit the Duration, Start Date, and Completion Date of the tasks depends on the Task Constraint and Duration Type. Not all Task Constraints and Duration Types allow for these fields to be edited.  
     >For more information about Task Constraint and Duration Type, see the following articles:
     >
     >   
     >   
     >   * [Task Constraint overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/task-constraints/task-constraint-overview.md)
     >   * * [Overview of Task Duration and Duration Type](../../../manage-work/tasks/taskdurtn/task-duration-and-duration-type.md)*

| **Icon** |**Description** |
|---|---|
|  ![](assets/11.png)

|When a single task is selected, the **Edit Task** icon provides several modification options for the task. These are the same options as right clicking on a &nbsp;task. &nbsp; |

|The **Column Preferences** icon provides the option to include or exclude columns from the grid section of the Gantt chart.&nbsp; |
|  ![](assets/13.png)

|  ![](assets/14.png),&nbsp; ![](assets/15.png)

|The **Milestones** icon is available when a Milestone Path has been assigned to the project. You can drag the milestone indicators and drop them on the tasks on your project that you want to associate with a milestone. When the project is not associated with a Milestone Path, this icon is dimmed.&nbsp; |
|  ![](assets/16.png),&nbsp; ![](assets/17.png)

|The **Legend** icon describes the color references for the conditions and Progress Status of tasks displayed on the Gantt Chart. &nbsp; |

|  ![](assets/19.png)

|The planned&nbsp;**Start**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**End**&nbsp;Dates are interactive. When the project is Scheduled from the Start Date, you may modify the **Start Date**; &nbsp;when the project is Scheduled from the Completion Date, you can modify the End Date.&nbsp; |

## Overview of other Legacy Gantt Chart indicators

The following indicators show&nbsp;additional information about the tasks on the project:

<table cellspacing="15">

   <td>The round indicators at the end of a task timeline are the <strong>End Nodes</strong> of the task. Predecessor relationships can be created by clicking the&nbsp;predecessor&nbsp;End Node&nbsp;and dragging a line to the Start or End node of another task. The predecessor&nbsp;Start Node&nbsp;functions the same way as the End Node. This option appears when hovering over the timeline of the task.&nbsp;</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <img src="assets/21.png" alt=""> </td>
