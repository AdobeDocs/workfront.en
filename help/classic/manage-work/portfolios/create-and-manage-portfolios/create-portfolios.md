# Create a portfolio

A Portfolio is a collection of projects competing for the same resources, budget, and schedule. The projects in a Portfolio are similar enough that they would use the same Resource Pool and be measured against the same scorecard.

You can use Portfolios to group projects that belong to the same product lines, divisions, departments, companies, or other business units.
