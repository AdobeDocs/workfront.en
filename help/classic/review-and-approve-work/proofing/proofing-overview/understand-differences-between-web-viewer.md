# Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

Adobe Workfront provides two different proofing viewers:

* **Web Proofing Viewer:**&nbsp;Designed primarily for proofing static and video files. Runs in Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. 
* **Desktop Proofing Viewer:** Designed for proofing interactive files as well as video and static files.&nbsp;Runs as&nbsp;a standalone application on your workstation. For more information, see [Understand the Desktop Proofing Viewer](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-dpv/destop-proofing-viewer.md)

* If your organization cannot use the Desktop Proofing Viewer app for security reasons, your Workfront administrator can configure your system so that you can review interactive content, bundled in a ZIP archive file, in the Web Proofing Viewer. For more information, see&nbsp; [Set up interactive content proofing in Web Proofing Viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/interactive-content-in-web-viewer.md).

The following list can help you understand what Proofing Viewer you can use to proof certain types of content:

* **Interactive web content - URL**: If you create a proof for web content using a URL and you want to proof the content interactively, you must use the Desktop Proofing Viewer.
* **Interactive web content - ZIP file**: If you create a proof for web content using a ZIP file, you can use either the Web Proofing Viewer (with some limitations) or the Desktop Proofing Viewer. For information about the limitations involved in using the Web Proofing Viewer for interactive content, see [Set up interactive content proofing in Web Proofing Viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/interactive-content-in-web-viewer.md).

* **Static and video content**: If you create a proof containing static content, you can use either the Web Proofing Viewer or the Desktop Proofing Viewer.
