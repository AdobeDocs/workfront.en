# Proof security overview

You can add extra security measures to proofs. We recommend switching to the new Workfront experience for the most optimized experience with electronic signatures and login required settings.

## Login required

Login required enhances the security of the proofs created in your account. You can enable login required for all proofs at the account level or you can enable it for individual proofs as needed. For more information about enabling for your account, see [Configure proof settings for your organization](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-proofing-organization.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When enabled, users cannot share the proof with Guest reviewers or subscribe to proofs.

### Access proofs with credentials

When login required is enabled, reviewers are required to log in using their email and password before they can view proofs created in your organization's account. Users should use their Workfront or SSO credentials, depending on how your instance is set up.

``` ```**Tip: **``````To streamline the login process, we recommend setting SSO up in Workfront and Workfront proof. For more information on enabling SSO, see

* [Single sign-on in Adobe Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/single-sign-on.md)
* [Configure Single Sign-On for Workfront Proof users](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-sso-for-wp-users.md)

## Electronic signature

Electronic signatures allow you to enhance security on your proofs and comply with industry security standards, such as ISO. You can enable electronic signatures for all proofs at the account level, or you can enable it for individual proofs as needed. For more information, see [Configure proof settings for your organization](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-proofing-organization.md).

## Sign a proof electronically

When the electronic signature setting is enabled on a proof, an electronic signature box prompts any reviewer who makes a decision to provide their email and password. Users should use their Workfront or SSO credentials, depending on how your instance is set up.
