# Review non-interactive content in the Desktop Proofing Viewer

Though the Desktop Proofing Viewer is designed for reviewing interactive content, you can also use it to review static and video content. Your Adobe Workfront administrator can configure the Desktop Proofing Viewer to open every time you launch a static or video proof.

Once you open a non-interactive proof into the Desktop Proofing Viewer, it works the same way as the Web Proofing Viewer. If you need information on this functionality, see [Review a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-a-proof/review-a-proof.md).
