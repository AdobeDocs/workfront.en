## Add, edit, or delete a deadline for a stage

You must be the proof owner or creator to set deadlines.

1. Hover over the proof, then click **Proof details** to open the Proof details page.
1. On the **Proof details** page, under **Workflow**, in the stage where you want a deadline, do one of the following:

1. ```<tbody>  <tr>   <td role="rowheader">Add a deadline to the stage</td>   <td>Double-click <strong>No deadline</strong>, then&nbsp;specify a date and time for the deadline.</td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td role="rowheader">Edit an existing deadline</td>   <td>Double-click the date and time in the upper-right corner of the stage,&nbsp;then&nbsp;specify a date and time for the deadline.</td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td role="rowheader">Delete an existing deadline</td>   <td>Double-click the date and time in the upper-right corner of the stage,&nbsp;then click <strong>Clear</strong> at the bottom of the Calendar box that appears.</td>  </tr> </tbody>``` 
1. To save your change, click outside the deadline box.
1. In the prompt that appears, specify whether you want to send an email alert to reviewers.&nbsp;

## Set individual reviewer deadlines

You can set different deadlines for different reviewers on a proof you have already created. This requires creating a&nbsp;separate stage for each reviewer for whom you want to set an individual deadline.

To create a stage and add a deadline for an individual reviewer:

1. Hover over the proof, then click **Proof details** to open the Proof details page.
1. On the **Proof details** page, under **Workflow**, click **New stage**

1. ![New_Stage_button.png](assets/new-stage-button.png)

1. If you do not see the new stage option, you must covert the workflow to an automated workflow first. 
1. Add information for the stage,&nbsp;particularly the reviewer's name and the deadline you want for the reviewer.
1. Repeat the two previous steps as needed to add any other reviewers who need their own deadline.

## Remove individual reviewer deadlines

You can remove a deadline for the stage the reviewer is on.

1. Hover over the proof, then click **Proof details** to open the Proof details page.
1. Proof details
1. Workflow
1. Click **Clear** on the calendar that appears.
1. To save your change, click outside the deadline box.
1. In the prompt that appears, specify whether you want to send an email alert to reviewers.
