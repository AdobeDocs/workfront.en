* Your Workfront environment is integrated with a Workfront Proof&nbsp;Premium account. For more information about what functionality is available only with a Workfront Proof&nbsp;Premium account, see .

  You have a Workfront Proof&nbsp;license. (It is not required that you are a Workfront Proof&nbsp;administrator.)

* You have administrative rights in Workfront and proofing is enabled on your Workfront user account.

  Or

  You contact Workfront Customer Support and request this access for&nbsp;all proofing users in your system, regardless of what permissions they have.

## Enable all proofing users to access Workfront Proof&nbsp;within Workfront {#enable-all-proofing-users-to-access-workfront-proof-within-workfront}

By default, only users with administrative rights within Workfront can access Workfront Proof as described in [Access Workfront Proof from Workfront](#access-workfront-proof-from-workfront)

You can configure all users to have access to the Workfront Proof button within the Workfront Global Navigation Bar Main Menu by contacting Workfront Customer Support and submitting a request.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>If you plan to allow all Workfront users to access Workfront Proof directly from the Workfront Global Navigation Bar,&nbsp;ensure that the permission profile you grant to the user does not provide more access than the user's access level within Workfront. Doing so ensures that the user cannot&nbsp;access proofs within Workfront Proof that he or she does not have access to within Workfront. For information about how to configure proofing access within Workfront Proof and Workfront, see .
