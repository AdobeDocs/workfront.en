You can generate a new interactive proof or a new version of an existing interactive proof for web content. This can be a website or other kinds of interactive content such as&nbsp;ads with streaming video or audio, HTML animations, and interactive banners.

>Make sure that the website or interactive content is accessible to the people who are going to review it. They can access it in the proofing process only if they can also access it on the internet.
