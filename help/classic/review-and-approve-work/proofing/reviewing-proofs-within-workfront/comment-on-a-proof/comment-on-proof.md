# Comment on a proof

Comments enable you&nbsp;to provide feedback on content and collaborate with other users in the proofing viewer.

When tagging users in comments on a proof, the users you are able to tag might differ depending on various factors, such as individual user permissions and your membership in the organization:

* If you are the proof creator, owner, or have specific permissions enabled, you can tag users outside of the proof workflow and share the proof with them.
* If you were added to the proof as an outside user and you are a member of another environment with a different proof account, you can tag only those users from your original environment. For more information, see [Proofing collaboration limitations with people outside of your organization](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/collaboration-with-members-outside-of-your-organization.md)

1. In static proofs, you can mark multiple areas on multiple pages for one comment. For example, if you want to make the same comment on multiple pages, select an area on one page, then go to the next page where you want to make the same comment and select an area there. (This applies only to the regular annotation markup tools, not the text markup tools.)
1. Type your comment in the **Add comment** box on the right.
1. (Optional) To tag another user in your comment and add them to the proof's workflow, type @ in the comment box, then type the user's name or email address and select the user in the menu that appears.&nbsp;For more information, see [Tag users to share a proof](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/tag-users-to-share-proof.md).
1. (Optional) To attach&nbsp;a file to a comment, do either of the following:

   * Click the paper clip icon in the lower-right corner of the comment, then find and select the file you want to upload.
   * Drag a file from a&nbsp;location on your computer and drop it into the comment area.

1. Click **Post**.
