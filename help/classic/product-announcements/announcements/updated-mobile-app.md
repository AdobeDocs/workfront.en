# Updated Mobile App for iOS and Android (Early August, 2017)

The Adobe Workfront mobile app should be&nbsp;updated in the Apple App and Google Play Stores in early&nbsp;August, 2017.&nbsp;

The update contains the following enhancements for both the Android and the iOS mobile platforms:

## Submit Requests

Starting with the new version of the mobile app, you will be able to submit requests to request queues using your mobile device. You will be able to&nbsp;access the same request queues that you have access to&nbsp;access from the web application.&nbsp;

You can submit a request, assign it to the right resource, and update it when you are on the go.&nbsp;

For more information about submitting requests on the mobile app, see the "Submitting Requests" section in&nbsp;.

For a demonstration of how to use this feature, watch the following video:

## Add New Entries to Timesheets

Starting with the&nbsp;new version of the mobile app, you will be able to add new entries (projects, tasks, and issues) to your timesheets and log time for them.

Prior to this update, you were able to only log General Hours to the timesheet, and to add time to items that were already on your timesheet.&nbsp;

For more information about adding new entries to timesheets on the mobile app, see the "Working with Timesheets" section in&nbsp;.

## Edit Custom Forms

Starting with the&nbsp;new version of the mobile app, you will be able to edit custom forms for the following objects:

* Projects
* Tasks
* Issues
* Documents&nbsp;

Prior to this update, you were able to only view information on custom forms on the mobile device.&nbsp;

For more information about editing custom forms on the mobile app, see the "Editing Custom Forms" section in&nbsp;.

## Proof Approvals Visibility in the Mobile App

Starting with the&nbsp;new version of the mobile app, you will be able to approve proofs of documents on your mobile device. You will also receive a notification in the Notifications area when you are designated as an Approver on a proof.&nbsp;

Prior to this update, you were able to perform project, task, issue, and document approvals using the mobile app. You will require a Proof HQ license to approve document proofs on the mobile app.&nbsp;

For more information about proofing within Workfront, see the [Proofing](../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md) section.&nbsp;
