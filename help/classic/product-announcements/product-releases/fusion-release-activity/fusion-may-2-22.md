## Filter execution history by date

To make it easier for you to locate the information you need from your execution histories, we've added the ability to filter execution history search results by date. Now, you can configure the date range calendar to return results from a specific range within the last 30 days.

Previously, the execution history search returned all results for the search from the last 30 days.

For more information, see [View a scenario's execution history in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-scenario-execution-history.md).

## Enhancements to Scenario Execution History search functionality

To make it easier to locate the data you need in your Scenario Execution History, we've made the following enhancements to the Execution History Fulltext search:

* Limit the search to specific dates within the 30-day Execution History archive
* Limit the search to specific execution statuses such as Success or Error
* Copy Execution ID with a single click
* See at a glance whether a particular execution was scheduled, instant, or manually triggered
* Use your keyboard to open the search window and navigate through the results

Previously, users could search only for text, and could use filters only on the full list of executions.

For more information, see [View a scenario's execution history in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/view-scenario-execution-history.md).
