# Workfront Proof release activity:&nbsp;Week of May 17, 2021

This page describes changes made to the Workfront Proof (stand-alone proofing application). Changes described here are not applicable to the proofing functionality within the Adobe Workfront application.

## User profile menus in Workfront Proof now use typeahead fields to search for users

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Preview environment on May 20, 2021. It will release to the Production environment on September 16, 2021.

To help manage large drop-down menus listing all users in the system, we've replaced all user profile search menus with a typehead search in Adobe Workfront Proof standalone. Some examples of user profile search menus include

* Proof owners
* Out of office contacts
* Template owners

Previously, all profile search drop-downs listed all users in the system, producing a large menu.
