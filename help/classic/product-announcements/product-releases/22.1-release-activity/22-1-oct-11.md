## For Workfront administrators: Select multiple notifications that you want to unlock or re-lock for groups

It's now faster and easier to unlock or re-lock email notifications for groups. Now you can select multiple notifications, check your selections to make sure they’re correct, then click the new Unlock or Lock button that displays in the toolbar.

Previously, you had to unlock and re-lock notifications one at a time. Workfront currently has 95 notifications, so this took a while if you had to do it for all or many of them.

For more information, see [Unlock or lock configuration of event notifications for all groups](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/emails/unlock-configuration-of-event-notifications-for-groups.md).

## For group administrators: Easier to select a replacement group when you delete a group

When you are deleting a group, two improvements in the Delete Group box make it easier to select the replacement group that you want to preserve the deleted group’s users, work items, and subgroups:

* You can start typing the name of the group to find it quickly. Previously, there was only a drop-down list that you couldn’t type in. This was problematic for organizations with many groups because you had to scroll through the list to find the group you wanted. Also, the drop-down list had an item limit, so it was possible that the group you wanted wasn’t displayed.
* You can use the new info icon to make sure you are selecting the replacement group you want. Hovering over the icon displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and the names of its administrators.

For more information, see [Delete a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/delete-a-group.md).

## New for administrators: Larger area for creating calculated fields

Now it’s easier to build complex calculated fields in a custom form. Click the new Maximize button to open a large editing window for building your calculation. When you are finished, click Minimize to continue working on your custom form.

For more information, see [Add calculated data to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-calculated-data-to-custom-form.md).

## Limit the ability to add documents to a template you are sharing

Sometimes people add documents to a project template thinking that they’re adding them to a project. Now you can help to prevent this—when you share a template with View access, you can disable the new advanced setting Add Documents. This disables your recipients’ ability to add documents to the template.

For instructions on sharing a template, see [Share project templates](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/share-project-template.md).

For information about the new advanced setting Add Documents, see the section in the article [Sharing a template](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-template.md).

<h2><a name="Improved"></a>Improved proofing capabilities for reviewers and requestors</h2> <note type="note">
Released to North America customers only; previously released to EMEA customers as part of the 21.4 release.
</note>
<p>To provide a more integrated experience between Workfront and Proof, we’ve made several improvements regarding proofing capabilities for Reviewers and Requestors:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>You can grant Moderator or Author roles to any user in Workfront, regardless of whether they have a Proofing license, giving them additional rights, like applying actions or resolving comments.</p> </li>
<li> <p>You can add Reviewers and Requestors to proofs that require a login or that need to be electronically signed.</p> </li>
<li> <p>All users also benefit from improved connectivity between Workfront and Proof. Now, when deactivating a user or updating a user’s email address, your updates are correctly reflected in proofing when changed in Workfront.</p> </li>
</ul>
