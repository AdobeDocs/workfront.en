## Work in Progress (WIP) Limit Enhancements on the Kanban Board {#work-in-progress-wip-limit-enhancements-on-the-kanban-board}

### Configure Work in Progress (WIP) Limits for Each Column on the Kanban Board

Now you can configure the Work in Progress (WIP) limits for each column on the Kanban board.&nbsp;

Prior to this change, you could configure only one WIP limit that applied to all columns on the Kanban board.&nbsp;

For more information, see the section&nbsp; [Configure the work in progress (WIP) limit](../../../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-kanban.md#configur4)&nbsp;in the article&nbsp; [Configure Kanban](../../../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-kanban.md).

### Update the Work in Progress (WIP) Limit Directly from the Kanban Board

Now team members with Edit rights to the team can update the WIP limit directly from the Kanban board.

Prior to this change, you could update the WIP limit only from the Team Settings area.

For more information, see&nbsp;&nbsp;in the article .

## Improved Interface for&nbsp;Configuring Statuses for an Agile Team {#improved-interface-for-configuring-statuses-for-an-agile-team}

The interface for configuring statuses for an agile team has been updated with the following improvements:

* New look and feel
* Reorder status columns via drag-and-drop&nbsp;

For more information, see the&nbsp;following articles:

* [Configure Kanban](../../../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-kanban.md) 
* [Configure Scrum](../../../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-scrum.md)

## Updated Work List (Left Panel) in the Home Area {#updated-work-list-left-panel-in-the-home-area}

The Work List in the Home area contains the following improvements:

* Unread items now stand out with bolding and a blue dot.

  Items that are viewed outside of the Home area are still displayed as Unread in the Home area.

  For more information, see [Display items in the Work List in the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).

* Issues are now distinguished with an issue icon displaying next to the issue.
* Approvals are now distinguished by approval type, with the type of approval being displayed. Possible approval types are Task, Project, Issue, Access, Document, Timesheet, and Proof.

  Prior to this change, approvals were distinguished only by the word "Approval."

* Items are now distinguished by whether they are ready to start. Possible options are Ready to Start, Not Ready, or Working On.

  This information is not shown for approvals because approvals are always ready to start.

* A document icon is displayed below the name of the item any time a document is attached to the item.
* You can now collapse and expand groupings within the Work List to better control what information is visible. The groupings are Late, Projects, Dates, and Completed.

  By default, the This Week section is expanded and all other groupings are collapsed.

* Choose whether to sort items by Planned Completion Date or Commit Date.
* The number of items in each grouping is now displayed in parenthesis next to the grouping title.

  This number is not available for the Completed grouping.

  For more information, see [Display items in the Work List in the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).

* Resize the Work List via drag-and-drop. You can resize the Work List to consume up to half of the screen. The size you set is retained the next time you access Home.

  Prior to this change, the size of the Work List could not be changed.

* For requests, the user avatar of the user who made the request is now displayed, with the text&nbsp;"[Approver_name] would like your approval on."
* When creating a new personal task, the "To Do" button is now labeled "Personal."

  For more information, see [Create work items from the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/create-work-items-in-home.md) in the article [Create work items from the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/create-work-items-in-home.md).

* Late items are indicated as Late only after an hour past the Planned Completion Date.

For more information about the Home area, see [Use the Home area](../../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-the-home-area.md).

## New Desktop Proofing Viewer for Proofing Interactive (Rich Media) Content {#new-desktop-proofing-viewer-for-proofing-interactive-rich-media-content}

The new Desktop Proofing Viewer allows you to proof interactive content. Unlike the existing Legacy proofing viewer and the new&nbsp;proofing viewer that run in the browser, the Desktop Proofing Viewer is an application that runs on your workstation.

Prior to the new Desktop Proofing Viewer, you could proof interactive content only in the Legacy proofing viewer.&nbsp;

The Desktop Proofing Viewer includes the following enhancements over the Legacy proofing viewer for proofing interactive content:

* Review unsecured (HTTP) sites

  The Legacy proofing viewer allowed you to review only secure (HTTPS) sites

* Review iframe-protected sites&nbsp;(sites that are protected from being viewed within an iframe).

  The Legacy proofing viewer did not support review for sites that are protected from being viewed within an iframe.

* View content with preconfigured resolutions for various devices. For example, you can see how content displays on various standard desktop resolutions, or on individual devices such as an iPhone 8.&nbsp;

For more information about downloading, installing, and using the Desktop Proofing Viewer, see [Install the Desktop Proofing Viewer for your organization](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/install-desktop-proofing-viewer-org.md).

For information about functionality differences between the Desktop Proofing Viewer and the browser-based proofing viewers, see [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md).

## Export the User View in the Resource Planner {#export-the-user-view-in-the-resource-planner}

We had temporarily disabled exporting the data from the Resource Planner when displaying it in the User View to address some performance concerns. With this release, we are re-enabling the export of data when displaying the Resource Planner in the User View.

For more information about exporting the Resource Planner data to Excel, see the “Export Option” section in [Resource Planner navigation overview](../../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planner-navigation.md).

To participate in our current beta program for the Resource Planner, see [Resource Planner Performance Beta.](http://community.workfront.com/discussions/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?GroupId=457&MessageKey=8b018ed9-97a2-4f9d-a93b-01a7b09b6350&CommunityKey=0425cafc-f0ec-47fc-be20-a21dc073d520&tab=digestviewer&ReturnUrl=%2fdiscussions%2fcommunity-home%2fdigestviewer%3fCommunityKey%3d0425cafc-f0ec-47fc-be20-a21dc073d520)

## System Setting: Session Information in External Pages {#system-setting-session-information-in-external-pages}

The Workfront administrator can now restrict the use of session information (for example, Session ID) when creating an External Page.

Prior to this change, users who could create External Pages could use any session information when embedding other sites into a Workfront dashboard.&nbsp;

For more information about configuring your System Preferences in Workfront, see [Configure system security preferences](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/configure-security-preferences.md).

## Support for Google Team Drives {#support-for-google-team-drives}

You can now link a document or a folder located on a Google Team Drive from Workfront.

Prior to this enhancement, you could link a document or a folder located only on the Google My Drive.

For more information about linking documents and folders from various applications to Workfront, see [Link documents from external applications](../../../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

```<iframe class="mt-media" src="assets/269712218?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640px" height="360px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>```

## New Export Limit for the Gantt Chart {#new-export-limit-for-the-gantt-chart}

You can now export up to 500 tasks in the Gantt chart.

Previously, you could only export up to 250 tasks.

For more information, see [Export the Gantt Chart to PDF](../../../../manage-work/gantt-chart/use-the-gantt-chart/export-gantt-chart-to-pdf.md).

## Paste from Clipboard Option Now Displays as Dimmed When Using Internet Explorer or Safari {#paste-from-clipboard-option-now-displays-as-dimmed-when-using-internet-explorer-or-safari}

The Paste from Clipboard option is now displayed as dimmed when using the Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, with a tooltip explaining that only the Chrome and Firefox browsers are supported for this feature.

Prior to this change, this option was not displayed when using Internet Explorer or Safari.&nbsp;

For more information about pasting images from the clipboard, see [Paste images from the Clipboard](../../../../documents/managing-documents/paste-image-clipboard.md).

## New Beta Environment for Android Along with New Features {#new-beta-environment-for-android-along-with-new-features}
