For a list of all changes available at this point in the 21.4 release cycle, see [22.3 Release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/22.3-release-activity/22-3-release-overview.md).

## For administrators: See which groups are associated with an approval process

To help you find out which groups are associated with the approval processes in your system, we’ve added a Group Name column to the Standard view on the Approvals page in Setup. Now you can view this information without having to create a custom view.

For information about approval processes, see [Approval process overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approval-process-in-workfront.md).

For information about managing group approval processes, see Create and modify a group’s approval processes.

## New for administrators: Groups can configure their own timesheet and hour preferences

>[!NOTE]
>
>Initially, in Production, this functionality will be available as part of a phased rollout only for customers on Cluster 4. This note will be updated as the functionality becomes available to other clusters.

In a large organization, some groups might need to configure timesheet and hour preferences independently to fit their unique workflows, rather than inheriting the preferences configured by an administrator at the system level. Now Workfront administrators can unlock a timesheet and hour preference for all groups in the system so that they can configure it on their own.

This ability was also added recently for project preferences and for task and issue preferences.

For information about how a Workfront administrator unlocks a timesheet and hour preference, see the section [Unlock timesheet and hour preferences for groups](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md#lock) in the article [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).

For information about how a group administrator configures unlocked task and issue preferences for a group, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-timesheet-hour-preferences-group.md).

## New for Workfront administrators: Configure layout templates for auto-provisioned users in the new Workfront experience

Now you can configure layout templates in the new Workfront experience for auto-provisioned users. In the Workfront User Attribute drop-down menu where you map user attributes (Setup > System > Single Sign-On), a new “NWE Layout Template” menu item is now available for making this configuration. Previously, you were able to configure layout templates for auto-provisioned users only in Workfront Classic.

For instructions on mapping user attributes, see [Map user attributes and auto-provision new users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/map-user-attributes.md).

## New field displays the groups your users belong to

Now it’s easy to find out which groups your users belong to. In a report or view that lists users, you can create a column using the new Other Groups field. This field lists the groups where each user is a member.

For information about using reports and views, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md) and [Views overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/views-overview.md).

## Include images in updates

On the Updates tab of an object, you can now add images by clicking the Image icon on the toolbar. You can also drag and drop an image into the update area. Note that your Workfront administrator must enable adding images before you can see the Image icon.

You can add images in both updates and replies. An image thumbnail in the update indicates that recipients can preview the image in the browser or download it, and email and in-app notifications show that images are attached to the update.

Previously, the only way to share an image in Workfront was to attach it to an object as a document. Images added on the Updates tab are only available on that tab and not on the Documents tab.

For more information, see [Update work](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).

Before Workfront users can include images in updates, this feature must first be enabled by the Adobe Workfront administrator, as described in Configure preferences for user updates.

## Configure how dates are applied when adding work items to a Scrum iteration

By default, when you add a work item to an iteration, the Planned Start Date and Planned Completion Date on the work item are modified to match the iteration start and dates. Now you can choose to keep the original Planned Start Date and Planned Completion Date on all work items for a team.

This option applies only to Scrum teams and not to Kanban teams.

For more information, see [Configure Scrum](../../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/configure-scrum.md).

## User assignments on Kanban and Scrum boards

We have updated the story cards on Kanban and Scrum boards to make it easier to assign a user to the story. Now you can click a team or user avatar to add an assignment when the story card is expanded. Previously, you had to locate and click a separate plus sign icon.

For more information, see

* [Assign users to a story on the Kanban board](../../../agile/use-kanban-in-an-agile-team/assign-users-to-a-story.md) 
* [Assign users to a story on the Scrum board](../../../agile/use-scrum-in-an-agile-team/scrum-board/assign-users-to-a-story-scrum.md)

## New filter experience in the Workload Balancer

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Preview environment on September 16, 2021.

We have redesigned the filter experience in the Workload Balancer to include the following additional functionality:

* Easier, more streamlined user interface that matches the new Workfront experience
* Additional fields that you can filter by
* Ability to duplicate a filter
* Sharing filters with other users

For more information, see [Manage filters in the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/filter-information-workload-balancer.md).

## Make fast assignments in the Workload Balancer

You can now efficiently balance resources in the Workload Balancer with minimum clicks by dragging an item from the Unassigned area and dropping it on a user’s line in the Assigned area. Using drag-and-drop, you can also unassign items from users and move them back to the Unassigned area, as well as move them to other users.

Prior to this enhancement, you could only assign items by clicking the More menu of a task or an issue, then using the Assign option. Now, the Planned Hours allocated to the user update in real-time while dragging the tasks.

For information about assigning work items in the Workload Balancer, see [Overview of assigning work in the Workload Balancer](../../../resource-mgmt/workload-balancer/assign-work-in-workload-balancer.md).

## Updated algorithm for smart assignments

We have improved the algorithm used when making smart assignments. With the new improvement, Workfront looks at the 30 most recent assignments made by the logged-in user to make suggestions when they assign tasks and issues. The list of suggestions can contain up to 50 users.

Prior to this enhancement, Workfront was considering the assignments on the parent tasks and other user attributes related to those assignments when suggesting users.

For information about smart assignments, see [Smart assignments overview](../../../manage-work/tasks/assign-tasks/smart-assignments.md).

## New experience when creating a project from a template

To make your use of Workfront consistent with the new Workfront experience, we have redesigned the interface for creating a project from template. The functionality for creating a project using a template has not changed. However, some of the improvements of this newly redesigned interface include the following:

* Preview template information before attaching it
* Add templates to a list of favorites during the project creation process

We have updated the interface for creating the project both when you create it from the Projects as well as from the Templates area.

For information, [Create a project using a template](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project-from-template.md).

## New default option for Workload Balancer

As part of our effort to deprecate scheduling and make the Workload Balancer Workfront’s main resource assignment tool, we have made the Workfront Balancer the default option for all new users. Currently, Scheduling is the default option. This change applies to all areas where you can access Scheduling from which include the Resourcing area (in the new Adobe Workfront experience) or in the People area (in Adobe Workfront Classic), as well as at the project and team level.

For information about deprecating Scheduling, see [Deprecation of Resource Scheduling tools in Adobe Workfront](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/deprecate-resource-scheduling.md)

## Improved search for requests now includes special characters

To make finding request queues faster and easier when submitting requests, we have improved the search algorithm to now find queues that might contain any special characters.

For example, you can find a request queue named “&#42;Workfront” by typing either “&#42;Workfront” or “Workfront” in the Request Type field.

All special characters are supported.

For information about submitting requests, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](/help/classic/manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).

## Review and approve proofs in the mobile app

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature will be generally available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store the week of October 4, 2021.

The Adobe Workfront mobile app now displays all proof approvals assigned to you, in your list of approvals in My Work. You can review a proof document directly in the app and make a decision on it.

The following articles will be updated when the app is released to the app stores:

* [Adobe Workfront for iOS](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/workfront-for-ios.md) 
* [Adobe Workfront for Android](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/workfront-for-android.md)

## Link documents from Dropbox Business

We've added Dropbox Business as an available document integration. Now, you can access documents you have stored in Dropbox Business directly from inside Workfront.

Dropbox Business allows you to link shared documents and upload documents to shared folders. Dropbox (not Dropbox Business) allows only the owner of the documents to view the document in Workfront.

Your Workfront administrator can enable this integration for your organization.

For more information see [Link documents from external applications](../../../documents/adding-documents-to-workfront/link-documents-from-external-apps.md).

For information about how a Workfront administrator can enable this option, see [Configure document integrations](../../../administration-and-setup/configure-integrations/configure-document-integrations.md).

## Blueprints details page now displays an image

The details page for each blueprint now displays an image of the project template that is installed with the blueprint. The image provides a preview of the blueprint contents so that you know what you are about to install. You can optionally preview the full image in the browser or download the image.

For more information, see Blueprints overview.

![](assets/blueprint-detailspage.png)

## Blueprints preferences for new issues

New issue preferences are now available for some blueprints. They are installed by default, but you can opt out of installing the preferences when you configure your installation details.

The preferences include queue topic groups, queue topics, and routing rules to collect the correct information when an issue or request is submitted, and send the issue or request to the correct job role or team. Using the preferences helps create consistency in the way that new issues or requests are captured on your projects.

Note that using these preferences does not make the projects created from the template into request queues.

For more information, see Configure a project template blueprint.

## Changes to agile view on projects

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Preview environment on September 16, 2021.

As part of the 21.3 release, we made improvements to the agile card header and story boards (see [Agile card header and story board updates](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/21.3-release-activity/21-3-project-enhancements.md#agile)). These updates applied to iterations as well as to the agile view on projects.

With the 21.4 release, we are reverting these enhancements for the agile view on projects. No changes are being made to agile iterations.

Following are the changes that are being reverted regarding the agile view on projects:

* The story cards and board columns have adjustable widths.
* Columns do not have background shading.
* Cards do not have identifier labels (parent story, subtask, story, task, or issue).
* The Parent Story column has been renamed to Stories.
