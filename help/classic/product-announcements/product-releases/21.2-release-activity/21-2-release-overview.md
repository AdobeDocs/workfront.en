  </tr> For administrators: View Audit Log information about many more areas in Workfront In the Audit Logs area, you can now track and troubleshoot changes in more areas throughout Workfront. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 22, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic For group administrators: Improved controls for moving subgroups and an updated toolbar We have made the following improvements in the Subgroups area in Setup. To give you a quick way to reorganize the groups you manage, we have added an “Add subgroups” toolbar button that allows you to create new subgroups and move existing ones. The toolbar in the Subgroups area now makes lists consistent with other modernized lists in the new Workfront experience. When you select groups, icons represent available functions in the toolbar. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 22, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New for administrators: Updated look and feel on Timesheets &amp; Hours Preferences page To improve the experience on the Timesheets &amp; Hours Preferences page, we have updated the user interface to match the more modern look and feel found elsewhere throughout Workfront. Sections and individual options are easier to read because they are separated by more vertical space. The labels for the 2 radio button options are broken up so they are not so long—the second part of each label is now an info message on a separate line. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 22, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic For group administrators: List improvements in the Groups area Two improvements in the Groups area in Setup make lists consistent with other modernized lists in the new Workfront experience: When you select groups, icons represent available functions in the toolbar. In the list of groups, columns, sorting, and hierarchy have the newer look and feel you are used to in other lists. Also, by default, lists display up to 2,000 items on a single page instead of 100. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 8, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience For group administrators: Create and edit programs from the Groups area in Setup We are continuing to make it easier to manage your groups and their associated objects in one place. Now you can view and work with a group’s programs from the Groups area in Setup. This saves you from having to go to the Programs area to manage your group’s programs. And it keeps the list of group programs you’re working with separate from the other programs in the system. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 8, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience For administrators: Refreshed headers in the Setup area To better orient administrators in the Setup area and to maintain consistency throughout Workfront, we have updated the Setup headers with various updates, including a large colorful badge marking each Setup page and subpage, as well as modernized font styles and sizes. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 1, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience For group administrators: View and manage more group objects from the Groups page We are continuing to make it easier to manage your groups and their associated objects in one place. Now you can view and work with your group’s companies, teams, and portfolios from the Groups area in Setup. This saves you from having to go to the various Setup pages for these objects to manage them for your group. And it keeps the list of group objects you’re looking at separate from those of the other groups in the system. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: March 25, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New for group administrators: Assign group timesheet profiles Now it’s easier to manage timesheet profiles for a group you administer. Not only can you create timesheet profiles, you can assign them to your groups or to individual members of your groups. This is true even when the Timesheets &amp; hours option is not enabled in your access level. Up until now, enabling Timesheets &amp; hours option was required in order to assign timesheet profiles. But this might not be ideal for every group administrator because it grants view and edit access to all timesheet and hours information in the system. If you don’t need this level of access, now you can manage timesheet profiles for your groups. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: March 11, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic For administrators: Set the Filter, View, and Grouping that users see in object lists Using a layout template in the new Workfront experience, you can now set the default Filter, View, and Grouping that users see in object lists throughout Workfront. For example, instead of leaving the Filter list control set to All, you can change it to My Home Team. This way, whenever a user views a list of objects, it includes only the objects associated with the user’s team. Previously, these defaults couldn’t be customized, so they were always set as All for Filters, Standard for Views, and Nothing for Groupings. One added bonus of the new functionality is that you can hide these three settings from your users if they don’t need them. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: March 11, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New for administrators: Easily list the reports that are currently using a custom field When you need to edit or delete a custom field that might already be implemented in some Workfront reports, it’s important to assess whether those reports will need adjustments in order to keep working properly after you make the change. Now, with the new Custom Field Impact view in the Custom Forms area in Setup, you can easily find out which reports use the field. Without this view, you had to run a report to find out which custom fields were being used in reports. This was difficult and tedious if your organization uses many custom fields. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: February 18, 2021 Production release: March 4, 2021 Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic For group administrators: View and manage a group and its objects in one place Now it’s easier to manage a group when you are viewing a group in the Groups area in Setup. The new More menu lets you quickly edit, copy, or delete the group without going back out to the Groups page. Also, you can view and work with your group’s layout templates, schedules, timesheet profiles, and subgroup members from the group’s page. This saves you from having to go to the various Setup pages for these objects to manage them for your group. And it keeps the list of your group’s objects separate from those of the other groups in the system. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: February 18, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New for administrators: More text formatting options available in Custom Form fields When users type in Custom Form fields that allow formatting, they can now organize the text using bullets, numbering, hyperlinks, and block quotes, in addition to bold, italics, and underline.

  </tr> Control what type of assignments you make on a new request We have changed the way the Assignments field functions when creating a new request to provide consistency and always show the same field regardless of what types of assignments users can enter. When you enable the Assigned To, Job Role, or Team fields to be visible when setting up a request queue, requestors will see the same Assignments field that can accommodate all or any of these three assignment types. There is an indication in the Assignments field about which types of assignments are allowed. For example, when you enabled the Assigned To and Team fields when setting up the request queue, you will be prompted to “Search people or teams” instead of “Search people, roles, or teams.” Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: April 8, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Improvements to creating requests and managing drafts As we continue to incorporate your feedback about creating requests in the new Workfront experience, we made several improvements to the new requests workflow.

Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: February 25, 2021 Production release: With the 21.2 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New experience when submitting requests in the Requests area To bring consistency with the new Workfront experience and create efficiencies for you when submitting requests, we have redesigned the New Request box in the Requests area.

## Functionality being removed from Production

### Feature rollback: Carry over the existing proof workflow when generating a new version

Due to customer feedback, **Workfront is removing this change from Preview environments on March 30, 2021 and from Production environments on March 31, 2021**.

On March 11, 2021, Workfront released a change to existing proof workflows in both Workfront Classic and the new Workfront experience. The change allowed for an existing workflow to carry over to any new proof versions created by a user, regardless of the method used to generate them.

In the new Workfront experience after this change is removed, proofs created with the Simple proof selection will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.

In Workfront Classic after this change is removed, the option to Generate Proof will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation.

Similar functionality to easily copy existing workflows might be added to Production at a future time.

## Functionality no longer supported

### Internet Explorer 11

With the removal of support for Internet Explorer, Workfront now officially supports Microsoft Edge.
