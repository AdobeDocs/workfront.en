## Adobe Workfront notification enhancements in Microsoft Teams

To make it easier for you to use Workfront through Microsoft Teams, we've added the following new functionality to Microsoft Teams notifications sent from Workfront:

* Expanded the types of notifications you can receive in Microsoft Teams. Now you can receive notifications about a greater variety of events, such as when someone comments on your timesheet or wants you to approve a document. 
* You can now comment and reply directly in the notification. Your comments and replies appear in Workfront in the work item's update stream. 
* You can see a work item's custom forms in the notification, and expand the custom form to see its fields.

To take advantage of this new functionality, you must log in to your Microsoft Teams account again. You don't need to take any other action.
