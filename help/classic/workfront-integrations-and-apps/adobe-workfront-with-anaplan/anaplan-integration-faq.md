## Do I have to use Adobe Workfront Fusion? {#do-i-have-to-use-adobe-workfront-fusion}

No. This integration can be completed with any Integration Platform as a Service. However, using Workfront Fusion will give you access to the Fusion scenario templates that lay the foundation of this integration and make it deploy much faster than building the integration from scratch.

## Can we do the same sort of integration with another finance tool other than Anaplan? {#can-we-do-the-same-sort-of-integration-with-another-finance-tool-other-than-anaplan}

Of course. However, as an Adobe premier partner, Anaplan is the primary focus for future integration investment. Customers integrating with Anaplan will be able to take advantage of the Workfront Fusion scenario templates that lay the foundation of this integration and make it deploy much faster than building the integration from scratch with another financial system.

## What license tiers can take advantage of the Workfront-Anaplan integration? {#what-license-tiers-can-take-advantage-of-the-workfront-anaplan-integration}

All Workfront license editions have access to this integration. Because it is built on Workfront Fusion, there are no license edition restrictions to deploy this integration.

## Will this integration require implementation services? {#will-this-integration-require-implementation-services}

You will likely want to leverage either Workfront or partner implementation/integration services. The foundational integration provided in the Workfront Fusion scenario templates have been designed and documented so that most users familiar with Workfront Fusion should be able to deploy the integration themselves. However, if you want to go beyond this starting point, you may want to engage with professional services.

## Is there a specific way that I have to configure Workfront for this to work? {#is-there-a-specific-way-that-i-have-to-configure-workfront-for-this-to-work}

The foundational integration primarily leverages native fields and capabilities to Workfront. For example purposes, the integration also includes some custom data mapping. When deploying the integration you can elect to remove, replace, or add new field mappings that are documented in the deployment documentation. The deployment documentation provides specific instructions on how Workfront should be configured for the base integration to function as is. However, because this is a Fusion-based integration, there is ultimate flexibility in how you configure Workfront.

## Is there a specific way that I have to configure Anaplan for this to work? {#is-there-a-specific-way-that-i-have-to-configure-anaplan-for-this-to-work}

The base integration leverages native Anaplan objects and capabilities, including Models, Modules, Lists, and Views. The Fusion scenario templates expect certain fields to be present in specific modules, lists and views. However, when deploying the integration you can elect to remove, replace, or add new field mappings. The deployment documentation provides specific instructions on how Anaplan should be configured for the base integration to function as is. However, because this is a Fusion-based integration, there is ultimate flexibility in how you configure Anaplan.

## Will Workfront professional services help me configure my Anaplan workspace? {#will-workfront-professional-services-help-me-configure-my-anaplan-workspace}

No. Workfront will not provide any consultation outside of the deployment document to assist in your configuration of Anaplan. If you require assistance making changes to Anaplan to accommodate this integration, then it is recommended you contact an Anaplan service provider.
