## Prerequisites

Before you can update a Workfront item using email content from G Suite, you must

* Install Workfront for G suite  
  For instructions, see [Install Adobe Workfront for G Suite](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/install-workfront-for-gsuite.md).

## Update a Workfront item using email content from G Suite

1. If the Workfront for G Suite panel is not displayed, click the&nbsp;Workfront icon ![](assets/wf-lion-icon.png) in the G Suite add-ons sidebar at the far-right of the page. 
1. With the email message open in G Suite, click `Post as a new update` in the G Suite panel.
1. Under `Type`, click the drop-down arrow, then click the type of object where you want to add the update.
1. Click the `Search for` option, start typing the name of the object where you want to add the update, then select the item when it appears in the list below.

   This option varies, depending on what you selected in step 3. It might be `Search for a project`, `Search for a task`, or `Search for an issue`.

1. Make any of these optional changes: 

   | Update |Edit any part of this text, which is taken from the email's subject line and body text. |
   |---|---|

1. Click `Update`.

   When you refresh your browser, a message with a link at the bottom of the Workfront for G Suite panel confirms that you have converted the email to an update:

   You can click the link to go to the Updates tab in Workfront for the object you specified in step 4.

   You can repeat these steps to convert the same email to updates, task, and issues (see [Create a Adobe Workfront issue in G Suite using email content](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/create-wf-issue-in-g-suite-using-email-content.md)). When you refresh your browser or return to the email at another time, all links you have created for the email are listed at the bottom of the Workfront for G Suite panel.

1. (Optional) Continue to work with the update in the Workfront add-on panel by doing any of the following:

  * To add another update on the `Updates` tab, click `Start a new update` and type the information. 
  
  * To reply to an update on the `Updates` tab, click `Reply` and type your reply.

    For both of the options above, you can click `Notify` to specify recipients for the reply as in step 5. When you are ready, click `Post` to add the update or reply. 
  
  * Click the `Details` tab to view the details for the new project, task, or issue.
