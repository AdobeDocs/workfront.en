## Set Status

This workflow step will allow a user to set Adobe Workfront statuses on Projects, Tasks, and Issues. This workflow step can be added to any workflow model. The Workfront artifact this step affects will be looked up using a relative path from the payload. The status is statically defined in the dialog configuration.
