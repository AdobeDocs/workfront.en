>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

This workflow step will allow a user to map a property to a Adobe Workfront custom form on a project, task, issue, or document. The Workfront artifact this step affects will be looked up using a relative path from the payload. Which properties to map are controlled within the steps dialog configuration.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> <!--
   <tr data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"> 
    <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
    <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
   </tr>
  --> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Product</td> 
   <td>You must have a license to Adobe Experience Manager</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
