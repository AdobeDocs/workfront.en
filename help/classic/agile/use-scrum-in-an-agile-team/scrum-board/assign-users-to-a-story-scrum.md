## Assign users to a story on the Scrum board

1. Go to the agile iteration or project that contains the story board where&nbsp;you want to assign users. For information about how to navigate to an iteration, see [View an iteration](../../../agile/use-scrum-in-an-agile-team/iterations/view-iteration.md).
1. Go to the story tile on the story board where you want to add a user.
1. Click the **Plus** icon on the story tile,&nbsp;begin typing the name of the user you want to assign to the story, then click the name when it appears. You can also click the&nbsp;drop-down arrow and select a user from the list. Users who are members of the agile team are displayed.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can also assign a job role to a story. You can only assign active users and ```active roles```.

   This option is available only when the story card is expanded.

   Or

   On an iteration, drag the user avatar from the list at the top of the page&nbsp;to the story card where you want to assign the user.

   The user avatar list remains at the top of the page even while you scroll down the story board.
