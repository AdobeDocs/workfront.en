>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

You might want to change the order in which stories are displayed within status columns on the Kanban board.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot change the order in which stories are displayed on the backlog for a Kanban team.

The order in which stories appear on the Kanban board does not indicate priority. However, it can affect the perceived priority by making stories more visible.

By default, stories are displayed in alphabetical order within each status column on the Kanban board.

When you reorder columns on the Kanban board, any changes you make are saved, so changes are retained the next time you or another user views the Kanban board. (Changes you make are not reverted&nbsp;when clearing the browser cache.)

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Worker or higher</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## Reorder stories on the Kanban board

To change the order or stories:

1. Go to the Kanban board&nbsp;that contains the stories that you want to reorder.
1. Drag a story tile to the desired vertical location within a status column on the Kanban board.
