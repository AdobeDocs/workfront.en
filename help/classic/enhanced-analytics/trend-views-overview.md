## Prerequisites

For prerequisites to using Enhanced Analytics, see [Prerequisites](../enhanced-analytics/enhanced-analytics-overview.md#prerequi) in [Enhanced analytics overview](../enhanced-analytics/enhanced-analytics-overview.md).

## Chart overview

The Trend views charts allow you to understand the average trend of when objects are added to a project compared to when they are completed. These charts allow you to see the point when tasks, issues, and planned hours are most frequently added (shown in purple) and the point at which they are most frequently completed (shown in blue).

Seeing this information helps you determine:

* The point in projects when you add to your tasks vs. complete them.
* How many issues come in and at what point in the project.
* How large most of your planned projects are.

**[Trend views screenshot]**

On the charts, you can see the following key details:

* The Trend views charts show the average number of tasks, issues, and planned hours for all projects (1).
* The number of tasks are shown on the left (2).
* The percentage of project duration is shown across the bottom (3).
* The blue line indicates the amount of tasks completed (4).
* The purple line indicates the amount of tasks added to the project (5).

## How to use the chart

* Hover should show a tool tip that shows the avg # on that day.
