# View and manage work item details in G Suite

You can view and manage the details of a work item without leaving G Suite. For example, you can read a task's description, view it's parent object, change its status, and mark it as complete, all within Workfront for G&nbsp;Suite.

1. If the Workfront for G Suite panel is not displayed, click the&nbsp;Workfront icon ![](assets/wf-lion-icon.png) in the G Suite add-ons sidebar at the far-right of the page. 
1. Go to the Workfront task or issue within G Suite, as described in [Access Adobe Workfront Home content from G Suite](../../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/workfront-for-g-suite/access-wf-home-content-from-g-suite.md).

   When you select a task or issue, the **Details** tab is open. The area above the **Details** tab displays the name of the parent object, the name of the task or issue, and the Due date (if it's a task) or Priority date (if it's an issue).

   You can do various tasks on this tab without leaving G Suite, including the following:

   * View the object's **Description** and other details, such as the users assigned to the object, the **Priority**, the requester, the **Planned completion date**, and any custom fields and forms attached to the object.

     Custom forms display only fields where information has been added.
   
   * Click the **Parent project** area to view the details of the parent object.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >This can be helpful when you have tasks and issues with the same name and you need to differentiate them.

   * Accept work assigned to you by clicking **Work on it**.
   * Edit various options, such as **Done** option, the **Status**, and the **Percent complete**.

     Under **Percent complete**, type numbers and (optionally) the percentage sign % to indicate your progress on an item.
