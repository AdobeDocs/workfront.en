## General recommendations for setting goals

Use the following guidelines when creating goals:

* Establish what your outcomes (your goals and results) are and what your outputs (the work that needs to be done) are. For information about outcomes and outputs, see the "Identify your outcomes and outputs" section in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront Goals overview.
* Avoid vague wording, such as “keep doing,”, “continue,”, and “maintain.". Make your goals aspirational, but still tangible and unambiguous. For example, "Grow our EMEA business", "Ship the new product feature", or "Increase customer support effectiveness" are clear, tangible goals. 
* Make your goals aspirational, but still tangible and unambiguous. For example, "Grow our EMEA business," "Ship the new product feature," and "Increase customer support effectiveness" are clear, tangible goals. 
* View your goals in the context of your organization’s overall alignment. We recommend that your goals connect to each other—, to deliver a cohesive view of your organization's strategy— and they connect to your work.
* Assign goals to larger organization units, like groups and teams.&nbsp;Then, assign the results and activities to individual contributors who can ensure they are achieved. 
* Ask individuals to propose goals that they set for themselves which are aligned with team and group goals and which ultimately contribute to achieving the overall goals of the company.

## Checklist for setting goals in&nbsp;Workfront Goals

Use the following checklist when creating goals:

* Goals should be:

   * Quarterly
   * Measurable
   * Indicative of what you want to achieve
   * Aligned to other parent goals or contributed to by results and activities

* Keep it simple and focused: Less is more when it comes to goals. You should set only 3-5 company-level goals a quarter. Each goal should have no more than 1-3 results or contributing activities to help you stay focused.

  For information about associating goals with activities, see [Associate goals with activities](../../workfront-goals/old-wf-goals-articles-aw/associate-goals-with-activities.md). For information about associating goals with results, see [Associate goals with results in the new Adobe Workfront experience](../../workfront-goals/old-wf-goals-articles-aw/associate-goals-with-results.md). 

* When setting a goal, we recommend that you follow this process, in this order:

   1. Propose goals as drafts for the upcoming quarter for your teams or groups.
   1. Start a conversation about your drafted goals and decide which goals you need to pursue for the next quarter. 
   1. Using the drafts, decide which goals you need to activate for the new quarter. 
   1. Do one of the following:

      * Encourage everyone in your organization to enter their own goals, activities, and results, by first aligning them with the team, group, or company-level goals that you decided to activate. After they have aligned and activated their own goals, you can activate the organization-level goals.

        Ideally, the progress of the personal goals of your individual contributors will ultimately achieve the organizational goals. In this case, your team, group, and company goals might not have their own activities or results. 
      
      * Activate the goals you want to pursue for your organization. Decide what results or activities you need to measure the progress on the goals you are planning for the next quarter. For information about activating goals, see Activate goals in Adobe Workfront Goals.

   1. Always keep the progress of your results and activities current. Review At Risk goals frequently and decide what adjustments you can make to deliver the goals on time.

      You can view At Risk goals in the Goal List. For information about filtering for At Risk goals, see Review in-trouble goals in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront Goals .

## Recommendations for managing goals based on your role

* [Manager or CEO](#manager-or-ceo) 
* [Individual contributor](#individual-contributor)

### Manager or CEO {#manager-or-ceo}

If you are a manager, or a CEO, we recommend the following:

* Add goals for your teams, groups, or your organization. 
* Manage at risk goals assigned to your unit first, then move down to smaller units. For example, as a CEO, manage company goals first, then move down to team and group goals. Dive deeper by looking into the results, activities, or other goals that contribute to the slow progress of the goals that you manage. 
* Communicate with teams or groups to identify efficiencies and find out where they might be struggling.
* Collaborate with individual contributors to see if they are overwhelmed or have too many competing priorities.

  For information about finding goals assigned to a specific owner, see Filter information in Adobe Workfront Goals.

* Use the Pulse section to both review goal progress and ask for updates on current goals.

  For information about managing goals in the Pulse section, see Review goals in the Adobe Workfront Goals Pulse section.

### Individual contributor {#individual-contributor}

If you are an individual contributor, we recommend the following:

* Find the team, group, or company goal that you can align your goals to. 
* Manage your personal goals that are at risk of not being achieved. At risk individual goals can delay the progress of group, team, or company goals that they are aligned to when they contribute to those. 
* Check the upstream implications of your personal lagging goals and ask for help to remove the roadblocks from your goal that could prevent you from achieving your goals. 
* Use the Check-in section to report progress on your goals.

  For information about updating goals in the Check-in section, see Check in on goals in Adobe Workfront Goals.
