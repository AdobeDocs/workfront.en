# Align goals to other goals

I created this to answer Alla's slack: https://workfront.slack.com/archives/DPUS05KFW/p1583936447000900

We need an article like the one linked from that former Atiim UI - the Atiim article is: [When Can I Align my Objectives?](When Can I Align my Objectives.md) >> create similar content here.

She removed the link in the UI for now.

Tell them to go to Teams, Groups,&nbsp;Company and pick the goal they want to align with first before they align theirs.
