When you create a team you become the Team Owner, by default.

You can view Team Owners for all the teams when you create a report for Teams and include the Owner Name field in your report. (For more information about creating a report, see [Create a custom report](../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).)

For information on how an Adobe Workfront administrator can create a team from the Setup area, see [Create a team from the Setup area](../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-teams/create-a-team-from-setup.md).

## Create a team

1. Go to the **People**&nbsp;area, then click the **Teams** tab.

1. Click the drop-down arrow next to the team name that is currently selected, then click **Create New Team** at the bottom of the drop-down list.
1. In the **New Team** box that displays, specify the following information:

   * **Team Name:** Specify a name for the new team.
   * **Group**: If you want to assign the team to an associated group, start typing the name of the group, then select the name when it appears.

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >When a team is assigned to a group or subgroup, any group administrators of that group or subgroup can manage the team without being a member of it. Group administrators can go to the Teams area from the Main Menu and click the Switch Teams arrow ![Switch team icon](assets/switch-team-icon.png) to list all of the teams that are assigned to the groups that they manage.

   * **This is an Agile Team:**&nbsp;Select this option if you want to configure this new team to be an agile team.

     For more information about agile teams, see [Create an agile team](../../agile/get-started-with-agile-in-workfront/create-an-agile-team.md).
   
   * **Team Members:** Begin typing the name of a user to be on the team, then select the name when it appears in the drop-down list.

     Repeat this process to add multiple users to the team.

     There is no limit for how many users you can add to a team. However, we recommend to not have an excessively high number of users in one team, as your work management might become too complex for these teams.
   
   * **Description:** Specify a description for the team.

1. Click **Create Team.**
