# Activate or deactivate a scenario in Adobe Workfront Fusion

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

You can work with scenarios either in an active or an inactive state:

* An active scenario executes periodically according to its defined schedule, as explained in [Schedule a scenario in Adobe Workfront Fusion](../../workfront-fusion/scenarios/schedule-a-scenario.md).

  This is useful when you want to automate the function of a scenario.

  <!--
  <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">For example, you could create an active Instagram-to-Dropbox scenario with a once-per-day schedule that uploads the photos you post on Instagram to Dropbox every day. </p>
  -->

* An inactive scenario executes only when you run it manually.

  This is useful when you want to run the scenario only at certain times.

You can activate or deactivate a scenario at any time, depending on how you want to use the scenario.

A newly created scenario is inactive by default.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to use the functionality in this article:
