# Delete items from Workfront Library

As a Workfront Library administrator, you can delete assets, folders, and collections in Workfront Library.

You can delete only the active (or current) version of an asset in Workfront Library. Older versions of a deleted asset remain in Workfront Library and cannot be deleted.

When you delete a container such as a folder or a collection, the items within the deleted container remain in Workfront Library. Users who had permissions to the deleted container loose access to the items that were linked to the container, unless they have explicit access to the items or have permissions through another folder or collection. For more information on access levels and permissions, see [Overview of user access to Workfront Library](../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/user-access-overview.md)

When you delete an asset that is also linked to a Workfront object, such as a project, task or issue, the asset remains with the object in Workfront and only the link between Workfront Library and the asset in Workfront is deactivated. For information on deleting content in Workfront, see [Delete Documents](../../documents/managing-documents/delete-documents.md).

Users with permissions to an item that is deleted do not receive notification of its deletion.

Currently, you cannot restore a deleted item.

1. In Workfront, click the **Workfront Library** icon on the Global Navigation Bar to open Workfront Library in a new browser tab. 
1. In the upper-left corner of Workfront Library, click the **Menu** icon.
1. Select the area where the item you want to delete is located.
1. Navigate to the item.
1. Hover over the item, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner of the item.
1. Select **Delete** in the drop-down menu, then click **Delete** again to confirm.

   The item is removed from Workfront Library.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you delete an item that is used as the cover image of a folder or collection, it remains the cover image until you select a different item, regardless of the item being deleted from Workfront Library. For information on changing the cover image, see [Change the cover image on an item in Workfront Library](../../workfront-library/content-management/change-cover-image-of-folder.md).
