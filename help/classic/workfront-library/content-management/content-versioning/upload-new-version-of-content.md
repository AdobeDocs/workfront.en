# Upload a new version of content in Workfront Library

If you have Manage permissions to content, you can upload new versions. For information on managing multiple versions of content, see [Overview of content versioning in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/content-management/content-versioning/content-versioning-overview.md) .

You cannot upload new versions of content in bulk. Each version must be uploaded individually.

1. In Workfront, click the **Workfront Library** icon on the Global Navigation Bar to open Workfront Library in a new browser tab. 
1. In the upper-left corner of Workfront Library, click the **Menu** icon ![](assets/library-menu-icon.png).
1. Select the area where the active (or current) version is located.

   You can choose Library, My Content , or Collections.

1. (Conditional) If you are in the list view, click the **Show grid view** icon ![](assets/grid-view-icon.png) to switch to the grid view.
1. Navigate to the thumbnail for the active content.
1. Hover over the thumbnail, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner of the thumbnail, then select **New Version** in the drop-down menu.

   The file uploading area displays.

1. Add the file you want to upload.

   * To drag and drop a file located on your workstation, select the file you want to upload, then drag and drop it into the file uploading area.

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >If you are using Internet Explorer as your browser application, you cannot use the drag-and-drop functionality.

   * To browse for the file, click **Browse** in the file uploading area, browse to and select the file you want to upload, then click **Open.**

   Depending on how your taxonomy is configured, the Metadata panel for the file you are uploading might display some pre-filled metadata from the active version along with any applicable EXIF, XMP, and file attributes. For information on content metadata, see [Set up taxonomy metadata for Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/set-up-taxonomy-metadata.md).

   Only metadata from the active version of the content is applied to the file you are uploading.

   By default, the name of the file you are uploading becomes the name for the content package, regardless of the names of previous versions. You can change the file name to match an older version.

   When searching for the content, users can search only for the most current file name. File names of previous versions are not searchable.

1. (Optional) To update the metadata for the new version, including the file name, edit the taxonomy fields in the **Details** panel.
1. Click **Upload New Version**.

   Once the upload is complete, the version number is added to the name of the content.

   An in-app notification announcing the newly-uploaded version is sent to all users with access to previous versions.
