You can add a document that resides in your My Content area to a project, task, or issue in Workfront. In order to add a document to Workfront from Workfront Library, you must have the following permissions:

When you add a document from Workfront Library to Workfront, Workfront creates a copy of the document. This copy is not linked to the document in Workfront Library, and changes made to one copy of the document are not updated in the other copy. Additionally, if you send a new version of a document that is already in Workfront, the new version is uploaded as a separate file with the same name as the original version.
