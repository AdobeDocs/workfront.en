# Rename items in Workfront Library

You can change the name of content, folders, and collections that you have access to.

## Understand renaming items

When you change the name of an item that you've shared with other users in Workfront Library, the item's name is automatically updated in all the shared instances. Users are not notified when you change the name of an item.

For information on changing the name of a collection, see [Edit a Workfront Library collection](../../workfront-library/content-management/collections/edit-a-collection.md).

If you want to rename a portal, contact your Customer Success Manager for more information.

## Rename an asset

When you rename an asset, Workfront Library changes the file name of the asset and updates the metadata to reflect the new name. If the asset is also uploaded to an object in Workfront, such as a project or task, the asset in Workfront is not renamed.

You can rename only the active (or current) version of an asset in Workfront Library. Older versions of the asset cannot be edited.
