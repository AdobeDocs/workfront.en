# Determine the display order of taxonomy fields in Workfront Library

When a user uploads new content to Workfront Library or opens an existing content file, the taxonomy associated with the content displays in the Details panel.

As a Workfront Library administrator, you can determine the order that taxonomy fields display in the Details panel.

For more information about taxonomy, see [Overview of taxonomy metadata in Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/metadata/taxonomy-metadata-overview.md).

1. In Workfront, click the **Workfront Library** icon on the Global Navigation Bar to open Workfront Library in a new browser tab.
1. In the upper-left corner of Workfront Library, click the **Menu** icon ![](assets/library-menu-icon.png).
1. In the left panel, click **Setup >****Taxonomy**.
1. Locate the field you want to move, then drag the field to the desired order.

   We recommend you place taxonomy fields in a hierarchical order, with the most important fields placed at the top of the list and the fields of least importance placed at the end.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The Name field must be the first field in your taxonomy.&nbsp;
