For information about how to create a group, see [Create Proofing Groups using Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-mnguserscontacts/groups/create-proofing-groups.md).

1. Start creating a proof using one of the following methods:

   * Create a standard proof.  
     For more information, see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md).
   
   * Create a new proof version.  
     For more information, see .
   * ```<font size="2">Make a copy of a proof.<br></font>``````<font size="2">For more information, see <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/copy-proofs.md" class="MCXref xref">Copying Proofs in Workfront Proof</a>.</font>```
