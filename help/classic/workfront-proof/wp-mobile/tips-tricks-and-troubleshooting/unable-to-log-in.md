## Problem

When trying to log in to the Workfront Proof Mobile App it returns:

"Your Username or password is incorrect. Please try again."

This problem occurs when you launch the Workfront Proof Mobile App by itself because it attempts to log in to a stand-alone Workfront Proof system, not the one integrated with Workfront.

## Solution

When using both Workfront & Workfront Proof,

1. Ensure that both the Workfront Mobile App and the Workfront Proof Mobile App are installed on your device.&nbsp;
1. Log in to the Workfront Mobile App and Go to the document you want to Proof.
1. Click the&nbsp;three-dot icon in the upper-right of the screen, then click **Proofing**.   
   The Workfront Proof Mobile App automatically launches logs you in.  
   You can now work with proofing in the document.
