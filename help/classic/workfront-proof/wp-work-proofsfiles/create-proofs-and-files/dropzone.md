If you have the Enterprise plan, you can use the Dropzone to submit new proofs and new versions of proofs to your account without having to log in to your account.

When you submit a proof via the Dropzone, it appears in the Dropzone page in your Workfront Proof account. From there, you can route it into your workflow.&nbsp;

## Emailing a Proof to the Dropzone

1. Send an email with the file attached to the Dropzone email address.  
   You can find the Dropzone email address in the Dropzone tab within Account settings. For more information, see&nbsp; [Configure the dropzone in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/configure-dropzone-in-wp.md)

1. Click the link and follow the steps above, depending on whether it is a new proof or a new version of an existing proof.  
1. The Dropzone owner (and any people set to be notified) will not be notified that there has been a new submission to the Dropzone until all the steps above have been completed.

## Completing Your Submission

Workfront sends you (the submitter) a Complete your submission email asking you to confirm whether the file was a new proof or a new version. The link in the email notification is valid for 24 hours.****

1. Click the link and follow the steps above, depending on whether it is a new proof or a new version of an existing proof.

## Activating the Proof

The Dropzone owner receives a notification email to advise that a new proof has been submitted to the Dropzone:

* The proof appears in the Dropzone page in your account (to access the Dropzone page, click the link in the left navigation sidebar).
* The proof is accessible by the Dropzone owner (or a user who has at least a Supervisor profile). The owner can be changed within Dropzone settings&nbsp;(only a Billing Administrator or an Administrator can do this).
* Before the proof can be worked on it must be activated/unlocked by the Dropzone owner (a user with at least a Supervisor profile can also do this). The status of the proof shows as Submitted until it has been activated/unlocked.

To activate the proof:

1. Go to the drop down menu to the right of the proof and click **Activate.** 
1. &nbsp;Once the proof has been activated/unlocked:

   * The proof status changes to Active.
   * Any people that were added to the proof will receive a notification email to advise that they have a new proof to review. (No email is sent until the proof has been activated/unlocked.)
   * The proof can be worked on as normal  
   * &nbsp;If the submitter also adds themselves explicitly to the proof, they will not receive a New proof email. For more information, see [New proof email](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/proof-notifications-and-reminders/new-proof-email.md).
