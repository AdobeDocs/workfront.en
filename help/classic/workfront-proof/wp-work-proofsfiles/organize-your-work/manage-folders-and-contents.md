One of the benefits of organizing your projects and proofs into folders is the ability to manage them on the Folder details page. This page is a control center for your project, from here you can conveniently manage individual proofs and files as well as perform bulk actions.

## Grouping Items So Reviewers Can Work On Them Together

You can use folders to group proofs that you want reviewers to work on together. When a reviewer opens one of the proofs in the folder to launch the proofing viewer, all the other proofs in the folder are availableâ€”the reviewer can work on any proof in the folder without leaving the proofing viewer. For more information, see [Work with multiple proofs in the proofing viewer](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/work-with-multiple-proofs.md).

## Adding New Items to a Folder

When you are creating a proof or uploading a file, you can select the folder where you want to store it in the Organize section on the&nbsp;New proof page or the&nbsp;New file page.

For more information, see [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md) or [Upload Files and Web Content to Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/upload-files-web-content.md).

>[!NOTE]

>&nbsp;If you are currently viewing the folder to which you would like to add a new item, that folder appears automatically in the Organize section when you open the New proof page or the New file page.
