You can create and edit tags and apply them to your proofs and files. This is great for when you have lots of different Workfront Proof items, such as projects, divisions, and clients, and you want to identify and find them easily.&nbsp;

You can apply tags to new or existing proofs, new files, new versions, and copies on any of the list view pages.

>It can be useful to use multiple tags when more than one category applies to one item.&nbsp;You can apply an unlimited number of tags any item.&nbsp;

Your profile and permission setting affects the tag functionality available to you:

* Billing administrators, administrators, and supervisors can use all the functions described on this page.
* Managers&nbsp;can&nbsp;create and edit tags only for their items.
* Observers cannon apply or edit tags on items, but they can view tags applied to items by other users and they can view the Tags tab in Personal settings.
