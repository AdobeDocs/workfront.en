The Miniproof is a widget that lets you embed a proof in a web page, blog, or wiki. The Miniproof shows the proof and all existing comments and mark-ups. You can use it to&nbsp;work on the proof as if you were in Workfront Proof.

Here is an example of a Miniproof embedded in a Basecamp project:

* Name of the proof (1)
* Fullscreen (2) - it will open the proof in the Proof Viewer (outside of the environment the Miniproof was embedded in)
* Help links (3)
* Actions menu (4)
* View comments in sidebar (5)
