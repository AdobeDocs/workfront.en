All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022.

>This article refers to functionality in the standalone product Workfront Proof. For information on proofing inside Adobe Workfront, see [Proofing](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing.md).

You can share a proof by providing the desired recipient with the Public proof&nbsp;URL.

A Public&nbsp;URL is a URL that opens the proof but does not log reviewers in automatically. Public&nbsp;URLs can be used when information about a proof is being sent to a group of people. When they access a proof from the Public URL, they will view it with read-only access. For information about access levels, see [Manage Proof Roles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/manage-proof-roles.md).

An option to sign is also provided, so people who were specifically added to the review will be able to sign in with their email address and make comments and decisions&nbsp;on the proof.

* You need to manually copy and paste the Public&nbsp;URL into an email and send this to the relevant person.
* The people you give the Public&nbsp;URL to will NOT appear in the Workflow section of the Proof details page.

If subscriptions are enabled on the proof, anyone who has access to the Proof URL will be able to subscribe themselves to the proof (so add themselves to the review cycle with the default role specified by the owner of the proof).

See [Subscribe to a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/subscribe-to-proof.md) for more information.

To use a proof's Public&nbsp;URL:

1. Go to the Proof defails page, as described in [Manage Proof Details in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/manage-your-work/manage-proof-details.md).
1. Open the **More sharing options** section.
1. Make sure that the **Proof URL** is enabled.
1. Copy the Public&nbsp;URL to the clipboard.
1. Paste the Public URL into an email or a chat window and send it to your recipient

## Accessing a Proof From a Public URL

The Public&nbsp;URL does not identify reviewers when the proof opens. Instead, the proof opens in read-only&nbsp;mode.

If a person wants to add a comment&nbsp;they need to identify themselves by signing in. If they are already a reviewer on the proof they will be prompted to enter their login details.

If they are not already a reviewer on the proof, they will need to subscribe.

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;Subscriptions can be disabled, in which case they will not be able to subscribe to the proof.

See [Subscribe to a Proof in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/share-proofs-and-files/subscribe-to-proof.md) for more information.

To access the proof from a Public&nbsp;URL:

* Users open the proof by using their login details which include their registered email and password for Workfront Proof.
* Non-users open the proof by entering an email address and display name.
* In either case, select **Remember me** so that you will have to enter your details this one time (for this proof).
