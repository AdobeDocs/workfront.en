Please see the section below for more detailed information on how to configure the Advanced branding options (2-14).

## Advanced Branding Configuration

You can brand the following areas of Workfront Proof:

### Web Application {#web-application}

![Web_branding_image.png](assets/web-branding-image-350x181.png)

You have a choice of three branding options for the web application header (2):

* Branding image in the header
* Your account name in the header
* If you disable branding the Workfront Proof logo will remain in the header of the web app

Branding image - resizes to a maximum size of&nbsp;550x90px. You can use JPGs, GIFs or PNGs, and the transparent backgrounds are supported.

Account name - taken from your account details and displayed using&nbsp;white font. Your account name can have up to 60 characters (including spaces and punctuation marks).

### Header {#header}

In this field (3)&nbsp;you can set the header's background and you can choose a solid color or a background image.

Color -&nbsp;here, as in all other branding fields of the color scheme configuration you can either enter a Hex color value of your choice or use a handy color picker (clicking the text field opens the pop-up).&nbsp;The default header background color is #232d2e.

Background image - can be combined together with the Branding image.

* Background image is positioned to the top left.

<note type="note">
&nbsp;The separate designs for the alerts are not required. If you’d like us to leave the default style of the messages, as shown on the screencasts above, please let us know. The team will match the colors with your design.
</note>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">If you'd like to have placeholder text in the text fields, please include this in your designs.</p>

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"><strong>2. Fonts</strong> </p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Please make sure that the text is not rasterized but kept as the text layers, unless you want the particular elements to be displayed as images on your landing pages.</p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">If you use custom fonts in your design, please make sure to include the following font files: EOT + .TTF + OTF + SVG + WOFF for support in all browsers.</p>
-->

<!--
<note type="note">
&nbsp; You need to hold an appropriate license, which allows implementing your selected fonts on the web pages.
</note>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">If you use the standard and widely available fonts, the font files are not required. Please see the following lists for reference:</p>
-->

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp">Websafe fonts listed in the standard Font families</a> </li>

  -->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"><strong>3. Screen resolution</strong> </p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">We support 1024x768 screen resolution (1366x768 for wide screens) and upwards. However, for the landing pages designs we do recommend using higher resolution for the better results on the various screens. The best practice would be to determine what screen resolution is the most common on your users’ machines and prepare a slightly bigger design.</p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode"><strong>4. Browsers compatibility</strong> </p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">The newer browsers generally don’t require any custom code to display the pages properly. However, if your users have the older browser versions installed on their machines some code adjustments may be needed.</p>
-->

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">By default we do prepare the pages compatible with the following browsers:</p>
-->

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Internet Explorer 9+</li>
  -->

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Safari 6.x+</li>
  -->

  <!--
  <li data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">Chrome 22+ *</li>
  -->
