During the review and approval process, you can send a message to one or all of the reviewers on a proof to remind them to complete their review or to provide other information about the proof. You can send the default reminder email or add your own customized message.

The default reminder email includes the following information:

* Personal link to the proof
* Thumbnail of the proof image
* The following proof details:

   * Proof name
   * Version number
   * Folder name (if applicable)
   * List of the reviewers and their progress on the proof

You can also remind somebody about multiple proofs that have been shared with them. For more information, see [Remind a reviewer about assignments in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-emailsntfctns/messaging-reviewers/remind-reviewer-assignments-wp.md).
