## Scenario Planner overview

The purpose of the Workfront Scenario Planner is to drive speed to execution for your organization-level plans and help you make crucial decisions that drive delivery of predictable, desired outcomes for your business.

Using the Workfront Scenario Planner, you can build enterprise-level plans that outline your company's overall strategic outcomes. You can define several initiatives for a plan and place them in various scenarios to find the optimal solution for executing the plan.

You can use the Workfront Scenario Planner to accomplish the following:

* Provide a simple and fast process of visualizing organization-level work plans over time.
* Optimize the allocation and assignment of necessary resources to maximize utilization.
* Help anticipate resource conflicts to make more informed decisions for hiring new employees, adding budget to your organizational plans, or shifting timelines and priorities.
* Create alternative scenarios for one plan with highlighted differences to quickly evaluate the effectiveness of each plan.

For information about starting with the Workfront Scenario Planner, see [Get started with the Scenario Planner](../scenario-planner/get-started-with-scenario-planning.md).
