You can connect projects with initiatives to ensure your strategic plans and the actual work are in sync. As you outline your strategic plans and initiatives in the Scenario Planner and you plan the actual work in a project, you can ensure your resources on both the project and the initiatives match, so you won't either overallocate or underutilize them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

* A plan in the Scenario Planner with an initiative connected to a project. 
* Required job role allocations for the initiative. 
* Tasks or issues on the project that have Planned Hours and are assigned to one of the following:

   * Job roles
   * Users associated with job roles

## Connect projects and initiatives

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can create initiatives and connect them to projects only if your organization has purchased an additional license for the Workfront Scenario Planner.

You can connect projects with initiatives by doing one of the following:

* Import projects into a plan, as new initiatives

  For more information, see  [Import projects to plans in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](https://one.workfront.com/s/document-item?bundleId=the-new-workfront-experience&topicId=Content/Scenario_Planner/import-projects-to-plans.htm).

* Publish initiatives to projects

  For more information, see [Publish initiatives to create and update projects in the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](https://one.workfront.com/s/document-item?bundleId=the-new-workfront-experience&topicId=Content/Scenario_Planner/publish-scenarios-update-projects.htm).

Both processes create a connection between the projects and their corresponding initiatives. After connecting them, you can manage their resource allocations by comparing them and ensuring that they match.

## Considerations about reconciling resources on linked projects and initiatives

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can view initiatives, connect them to projects, and view their resource allocations on a project only if your organization has purchased an additional license for the Workfront Scenario Planner.

* You can assign users, teams, and job roles to work items on a project and you can assign job roles to initiatives. As a result, you can only reconcile job roles between projects and initiatives.

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >To reconcile the users' time on a project with role allocations on the initiatives you must associate users with job roles.

* You can view initiative job role allocation on a linked project in the following areas of the project:

   * The Role Allocation panel in the following area:

      * Workload Balancer of the project

        For information about how to view the allocations of roles from the initiative and the linked project in the Workload Balancer, see [Show role allocation for projects and initiatives in the Workload Balancer](../scenario-planner/show-role-allocation-workload-balancer.md).

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >You can see job role information from the project and the initiative side-by-side in Role Allocation panel.

* You cannot view job role allocation for a project on a linked initiative. For more information, see Import projects to plans in the Scenario Planner.
