# Currently Released Resource Management Functionality

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>&nbsp;This article was last updated on July 8, 2019.

We are currently redesigning our Resource Management capabilities in Adobe Workfront.  
For more information about Resource Management, see [Get started with Resource Management](../../resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/get-started-resource-management.md).

Resource Management includes functionality for planning resources, as well as for scheduling resources for work. While resource planning occurs before the work actually begins, resource scheduling occurs after work has been marked as currently ready to start.&nbsp;

We are releasing the newly redesigned features to the Preview environment first and, at the end of our release cycles, we will release the vast majority of these features to the Production environment.   
For more information about our current releases, see our [Release Page](https://workfront.com/release).&nbsp;

The following table lists currently released functionality and the environment to which it has been released for both planning and scheduling resources. Most of the links include videos where you can see individual features demonstrated. The more recently released features are listed first:&nbsp;
