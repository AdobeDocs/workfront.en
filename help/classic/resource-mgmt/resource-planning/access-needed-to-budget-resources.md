You can view resource budgeting information for the projects that you have access to view when your company has purchased an&nbsp;Adobe Workfront license that includes Resource Planning.

In order to budget resources, manage Resource Pools, and see Cost information in the resource planning tools, your company and you must have the following access:&nbsp;
