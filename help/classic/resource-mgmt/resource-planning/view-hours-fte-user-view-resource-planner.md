In addition to budgeting resources in the Project and Role views, you can use the User View of the Adobe Workfront Resource Planner to display information about the Planned, Available, and Actual Hours or FTE values for projects and resources.

## Overview of the User View in the Resource Planner

Consider the following when viewing the Hours or FTE information in the Resource Planner:

* You can view the Available and Planned Hours or the FTE information for users, job roles, and projects in all views of the Resource Planner.
* You can view the following information only in the User View:

   * The difference between the amount of Planned Hours or FTE and the amount of Available Hours or FTE. You can then budget the allocation of your users according to this difference in the Project and Role views. 
   * The Actual Hours or FTE.

* You can display the difference between the User Available and the amount of Planned Hours or FTE either as a number or as a percentage value in the User view. 
* You cannot display the information in the User view by Cost. 
* <![CDATA[			]]>Adobe Workfront populates Available Hours or FTE according to the working time associated with the users in their schedules.  
  Users not associated with a schedule show availability according to the Default Schedule.  
  For information about the Default Schedule, see [Create a schedule](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md).

* <![CDATA[				]]>Workfront populates Planned Hours or FTE from the Planned Hours information on the tasks and issues on the projects. 
* <![CDATA[				]]>Workfront populates Actual Hours with the actual time logged to tasks and issues by the users who are assigned to them. This includes time logged on a project. 
* When in the User view, you can do the following:

   * Expand each user to display a list of projects where that user is assigned.

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >Only users who are associated with the projects included in the filters can be expanded.

   * Expand every project to display a list of job roles that user can fulfill on those projects. 
   * Expand each role to display a list of tasks the user in that role is assigned to.

  If users have no job roles associated with them, their Available, Planned, and Actual Hours or FTE are listed in the **No Role** section.  
  For information about what fields and items display when applying the User view to the Resource Planner, see the "Project/ Role/ User View Selection" section in [Resource Planner navigation overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planner-navigation.md).

## Overview of fields visible in the User View of the Resource Planner

Refer to the following tables for understanding the information displayed in the User view of the Resource Planner. The information displays in Hours or FTE values.

* [The AVL (Available) column](#the-avl-available-column) 
* [The PLN (Planned) column](#the-pln-planned-column) 
* [The ACT (Actual) column](#The%C2%A0ACT) 
* [The DIF (Difference) column](#the-dif-difference-column) 
* [The % (Planned Hours Allocation Percentage) column](#the-planned-hours-allocation-percentage-column)

Consider the following when viewing Planned Hours:

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: this is a snippet converted to text because there are difference from project/ role views and the user view (users with no pools DO show in user view)</p>
-->

* Planned Hours are equally distributed to each day within the Duration of tasks and issues , for each resource assigned to them. The task or issue Duration is based on their Planned Start and Completion Dates and includes every calendar day within that period of time.  
  Workfront takes into account the schedule of the user or of the project when distributing Planned Hours to users or projects. In this case, Planned Hours are equally distributed to each day within the Duration of tasks or issues excluding weekends, time-off days, and schedule exceptions.

  If you display the Resource Planner by Week, for example, and you have tasks that span multiple weeks on projects, the number of Planned Hours per week depends on how many days within that week are part of the task Duration. This works similarly when displaying the Resource Planner by Month or Quarter and when tasks span multiple months or quarters.  
  Weekend days, schedule exceptions, and time-off days are excluded from this distribution.

* The following categories of tasks are included in calculating the Planned Hours for each resource:

   * tasks assigned to users in Resource Pools, job roles, or teams on the project.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >If tasks are assigned to teams, their allocation will appear under **No Role** and **No User** sections. You can see the Planned Hours associated with teams, but you cannot budget the hours, because no roles nor users are associated with the tasks.

* Planned Hours in the Resource Planner do not include Planned Hours associated with the following:

   * parent tasks
   * unassigned tasks
   * issues, when the **Include hours from Issues** setting is disabled.

* Planned Hours do not display in the Resource Planner if the task or issue Duration is zero.
* Planned Hours associated with deactivated users do not display.

For more information about Planned Hours and FTE in the Resource Planner, see [Overview of hours, FTE, and cost information in the Project and Role views of the Resource Planner](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/overview-of-planner-hour-fte-cost-information-in-role-project-views.md).

  <tr> 
   <td>Task or Issue</td> 
   <td>This information is not available for the Task, Issue, or Project. </td>

If the value of the Planned Hours or FTE is zero, the Percentage Allocation is 0%. If the value of the Available Hours or FTE is zero, the Percentage Allocation cannot be calculated.
