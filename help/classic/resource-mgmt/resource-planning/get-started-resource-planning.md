You can use the Adobe Workfront Resource Management tools to forecast the allocation of your resources so that you know with accuracy whether your projects are delivered on time and on budget. For an overview of Resource Management in Workfront, see [Get started with Resource Management](../../resource-mgmt/resource-mgmt-overview/get-started-resource-management.md).

You can use resource planning tools to manage your job roles, their availability, and general allocation to projects based on this availability.

Budgeting users' general allocation to projects does not assign them to actual work (tasks and issues). You must assign your resources to work by using the Resource Scheduling tools.

For more information about scheduling resources in Workfront, see [Resource Scheduling](../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/resource-scheduling-overview.md) .

## Resource planning tools in&nbsp;Workfront

To budget time for your resources for the projects you plan to assign them to, you can use the following tools:

* For budgeting allocations for and prioritize multiple projects at the system-level: use the system-level Resource Planner.

  You can access the Resource Planner by going to the  Resource Planner subtab  in the  People area.

  For information about the Resource Planner, see [Resource Planner overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).

* For budgeting allocations for a single project: use the&nbsp;project-level Resource Planner in the Resource Budgeting area of the Business Case of a the project. For information about budgeting resources for one project, see the article [Budget resources in the Business Case](../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/budget-resources-in-business-case.md).

  To manage users and organize them in pools based on common skills or departmental structure and then manage their allocations for the projects they are assigned to, you must create resource pools.&nbsp;For more information about creating resource pools, see [Create resource pools](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/create-resource-pools.md).

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >The Resource Budgeting area of a project is the Resource Planner at the project level. When you budget resources in the Business Case of a project, the information is also reflected in the system-level Resource Planner.

## The purpose of the resource planning tools

* Using the Resource Planner you can do the following:

   * Prioritize your projects to decide which projects should receive resources first. (Only in the Resource Planner)
   * Understand the availability of your resources based on the schedule of your users.
   * Budget hour, FTE, or cost allocations for your resources (users and job roles) for the projects to which they are assigned.

  For information about working in the Resource Planner, see the article [Resource Planner overview](../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/get-started-resource-planner.md).
