Resource pools are collections of users what help you manage resources in Adobe Workfront.

You must create a resource pool before you can associate it with users.

You can associate users with resource pools when you are creating your resource pools.

If you create resource pools without populating them with users, you can later associate them with users as you are editing or creating new users.

For information about resource pools, see [Resource pools overview](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/work-with-resource-pools.md).

For information about creating resource pools, see [Create resource pools](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-pools/create-resource-pools.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Pro and higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Resource Management that includes access to Manage Resource Pools</p> <p>Edit access to Projects, Templates, and Users</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions for the projects, templates, and users you associate the resource pools with</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

1. Select the **People** tab. 
1. Select several users on the list, and click **Edit**.
1. Click **Resource Planning**.

   >[!NOTE]
