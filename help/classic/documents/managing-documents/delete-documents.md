# Delete Documents

You can delete documents you upload. If you're given manage access to specific documents, you can delete those as well.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p> Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront licenses*</td> 
   <td> <p>Work or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Documents the Delete permission enabled</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View access or higher on the object that contains the Document</p> <p>Manage access with the Delete permission enabled on the Document</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

To delete a document:

1. Go to the project, task, or issue that contains the document, then select **Documents**.
1. Find the document you need.

1. Click **Delete** above the Documents area.
1. In the box that appears, click **Yes, Delete it**&nbsp;to confirm.

A system or group administrator can restore a document within 30 days of being deleted, as described in [Restore deleted items](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/manage-deleted-items/restore-deleted-items.md).
