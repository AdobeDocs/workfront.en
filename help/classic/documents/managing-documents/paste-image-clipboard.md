## Paste from the Clipboard

To add an image or screenshot&nbsp;to Workfront via the clipboard:

1. On your workstation, copy an image or screen shot to the system clipboard.

   For example, right-click on a browser image and select **Copy Image**, or copy an image from an image application such as Photoshop or SnagIt.

1. In Workfront, Go to the **Documents**&nbsp;area where you want to add the image.
1. Click **Add Document**&nbsp;> **Paste from Clipboard**.

   If you are using the Internet Explorer or Safari browser, Paste from Clipboard is not supported, and displays as dimmed in the Add Document drop-down menu.

1. In the **Paste from Clipboard** box that appears, do either of the following, depending on your operating system:

   * **Windows:** Press&nbsp;CTRL+V.
   * **Mac:**&nbsp;Press Command+V

1. To add additional images, repeat step 1 to copy another image, then paste the image to the Paste from Clipboard dialog box as described in Step 4.

   Each image you paste into the dialog box is added as a separate file.

1. Click **Done**.
