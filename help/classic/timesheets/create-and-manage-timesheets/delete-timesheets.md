# Delete timesheets in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront

The changes you make to a timesheet profile are not effective right away for the currently existing timesheets, as explained in [Create, edit, and assign timesheet profiles](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md). To make the changes visible on existing timesheets, you must&nbsp;delete the timesheets that have been generated and generate new ones. This applies only to timesheets that have been generated by associating timesheet profiles with users.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Timesheets that have been created manually cannot be recreated by regenerating timesheets, unless the users have been associated with a timesheet profile since the timesheet was created manually. Deleting a manually created timesheet can cause loss of data. For information about creating a single timesheets, see [Create a single-use timesheet](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-tmshts.md).

Adobe Workfront administrators or group administrators can generate timesheets for everyone in the system. For more information about manually generating timesheets, see:

* [Manually generate timesheets](../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/manually-generate-timesheets.md)
* Create and manage a group’s timesheet profiles

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>* You cannot recover a deleted timesheet.
>* We recommend that you do not delete past timesheets because they are not generated automatically based on timesheet profiles. You can delete the current and future timesheets and generate them manually if you want the changes to your timesheet profiles to be immediately visible in the new timesheets.
>* When you delete timesheets, the hours logged against tasks, issues, and projects are not deleted. Only the General Hours are deleted with the timesheet. In a separate text editor, write down&nbsp;what General Hours are associated with the timesheet. After the timesheet is deleted, you can then log them in the new timesheet.
