## Share dashboards

You can share a dashboard with users in the following ways:

* Sharing on an individual basis.  
  For more information about sharing dashboards, see [Share reports, dashboards, and calendars](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/permissions-reports-dashboards-calendars.md) and [Share a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/share-dashboard.md).

* Add a custom tab to any area or object in Workfront and add a dashboard to it.  
  For more information about creating custom tabs, see [Create custom tabs or sections](../../../workfront-basics/manage-your-account-and-profile/configuring-your-user-profile/create-custom-tabs.md).

* Place the dashboards on layout templates which you can share with users.  
  For more information about sharing dashboards through layout templates, see [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

* Print a hard copy of them to share with users.  
  For more information about printing dashboards, see [Print a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/print-dashboard.md).

* Export them as a .pdf file so you can email them to users.  
  For more information about exporting a dashboard to a .pdf file, see [Export a dashboard](../../../reports-and-dashboards/dashboards/creating-and-managing-dashboards/export-dashboard.md).

When you share a dashboard with users, all the reports, calendars, and external pages that are on the dashboard are also shared with the same users by default.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a user is deleted, any dashboards they have created are no longer accessible. To learn more, see [Delete users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/delete-a-user.md).

## Display dashboards

You can display a dashboard in the following ways:

* Access the tab that it is placed on and the dashboard placed on the tab displays.  
  For more information about placing dashboards on custom tabs or layout templates, see [Create custom tabs or sections](../../../workfront-basics/manage-your-account-and-profile/configuring-your-user-profile/create-custom-tabs.md).

* Search for and manually access it when you find it.

## Access a dashboard

1. Go to the **Reporting** area in the **Global Navigation Bar**.
1. Select the **Dashboards** tab.
1. Select any of the following:

   * **My Dashboards**: Dashboards you have built are listed here.

     >[!TIP]
     >
     >If you don't have Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards, and Calendars in your access level, you cannot create dashboards. In this case, the My Dashboards list is empty.

   * **Shared Dashboards**: Dashboards that are created by other users and shared with you are listed here.
   * **All Dashboards**: Both your and other users' dashboards that are shared with you are listed here.

1. Click the name of a dashboard to display it.  
   The dashboard displays the information included in the reports, calendars, or external pages that populate it.
1. (Optional and conditional) Click the **Reload** icon in the upper right of the dashboard to refresh the information on the dashboard.  
   The information on the dashboard is synchronized in real time when you first access it. If you have displayed the dashboard for a while in your browser, the information inside the reports on the dashboard could become outdated. The date and time when the dashboard was last refreshed is listed to the left of this icon.
