# Share a calendar report

You can share a calendar with other users and you can make it available publicly, allowing someone without an Adobe Workfront license to view it.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Share a calendar with Workfront users

Sharing a calendar is similar to sharing other objects. For more information about sharing objects in Adobe Workfront, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

Calendars that have been shared with you display with an asterisk (&#42;) next to the calendar name.

To share a calendar inside of Workfront:

1. Go to the calendar you want to share.
1. Click **Calendar Actions**, then click **Sharing**.

1. In the **Give Calendar access to** field, begin typing the name of the user, team, role, group, or company that you want to share the calendar, then click the name when it displays in the drop-down list.  
   To learn about setting permissions, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).

1. (Optional) Repeat step 3 for each user, team, role, or group that you want to grant access to the calendar.
1. Specify the permissions for each user, team, role,&nbsp;group, or company that you added in Step 3 by clicking&nbsp;the drop-down menu, then select the permission level that you want to grant:

   * **View:**&nbsp;Users can&nbsp;review and share&nbsp;the calendar.&nbsp;
   * **Manage:**Users&nbsp;have full access to the calendar, minus administrative&nbsp;rights which are granted at the access level, plus all View permissions.

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >&nbsp;The Workfront administrator and the creator of the calendar have the ability to remove permissions from these entities.
