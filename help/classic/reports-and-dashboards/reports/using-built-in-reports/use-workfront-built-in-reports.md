# Use Adobe Workfront built-in reports

Adobe Workfront has an extensive list of built-in reports that you can use.

Workfront administrators can hide built-in reports so users do not have access to them.  
For more information about how to hide built-in reports, see [Hide built-in reports](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-reports/hide-built-in-reports.md).

## Access requirements
