Utilization reports enable you to view the progress or cost of one or more projects in a single report.

You must have Manage access to the projects in order to access utilization information in the Utilization tab in the Reports area. If you are still unable to access this information, contact your Adobe Workfront administrator.

For information about how to access and use the utilization report, see the article [View resource utilization information](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-utilization/view-utilization-information.md)
