# Create a copy of a report

You can create a copy of any report that you have access to. You can either create an exact copy of a custom report or you can save a new version of a default report. After you copy a report, you become the owner of the copied report and it displays in the My Reports section.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars</p> <p>Edit access to Filters,&nbsp;Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## Create an exact copy of a report

If you want to make a copy of a report that you are the owner of, do the following:

1. Go to the **Reports** area in the Global Navigation Bar. 
1. Click **All Reports**. 
1. Open a report.
1. Click **Report Actions**, then **Copy**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If the report is a default report, the Copy option does not appear in the Report Actions menu.  
   >For information on how to create a copy of a default report, see [Create a new version of a report](#create-a-new-version-of-a-report).

   ![](assets/classic-select-copy.png)

   A copy of the original report is created with the default name of *Copy of [Name of the original report]*. For example, the report "Q4 Completed Tasks" would have "Copy of Q4 Completed Tasks" as the name.

1. (Optional) To rename the report, start typing a new name.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If you deselect the title before typing the new name, select the report title, delete the name, then enter the new name.

1. (Optional) To share the new version of the report with other users, click **Report Actions**, then **Sharing**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The sharing information does not transfer to the copied report from the original version.  
   >For information on how to see who the previous report was shared with, see [Create a report on reporting activities](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/report-usage/create-report-reporting-activities.md#identify).

1. (Optional) If you have Manage permissions to the original report and the original report is no longer needed, you can delete it to remove unnecessary duplicated reports in Workfront.

   To delete the original report, do the following:

   1. Navigate to the report.
   1. Click **Report Actions**, then **Delete**.
   
   1. Click **Yes, Delete It** to confirm that you want to delete the report.
