You can schedule reports to automatically deliver to users on a defined schedule, or you can manually send reports on a one-time basis. When you send a report from Adobe Workfront, the user receives an email with the Workfront report in a separate attachment.

For more information, including size limitations that can affect the delivery of your reports, see [Report delivery overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/set-up-report-deliveries.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must create a report. To learn more about creating reports, see [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).

## Schedule a report delivery

To schedule a report for automatic delivery or to edit or delete an existing report delivery:â€‹

1. Go to a report that you want to schedule for delivery.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Report deliveries do not contain prompts. If you wish to limit data in a report delivery, we recommend applying filters to the report that you want to send.

1. Click **Report Actions**, then **Send Report**.

   The **Send Report** dialog box displays.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >To send a report manually at any given time, go to the report, then click **Report Actions** > **Send Report** > **Send Now**.

1. Select the **Repeating Deliveries** tab.

1. (Conditional) To modify an existing repeating report delivery, select the report delivery in the **Repeating Deliveries** section.
1. Specify the following information:

   <table cellspacing="0">

    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader"> <p>Send to</p> </td>

        <ul> 
         <li>lf your organization restricts Workfront notifications to specific email domains, you may only be able to send reports to email addresses listed in the email allowlist.<p>For information on how a Workfront administrator updates the email allowlist, see the section <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/configure-your-email-allowlist.md#configur" class="MCXref xref">Configure your email allowlist</a>.</p></li> 
         <li> <p>Adding a large number of users as recipients can cause the delivery to fail. If you experience delivery failures, you can schedule multiple report deliveries with smaller groups of users.</p> </li>

If you exceed those limits, your file will not open and it is recommended to resend without the hyperlinks. Please go back to the report scheduler to remove hyperlinks and resend the report." The "please go back to the report scheduler" phrase is a link back to the report.</p> </td>
