# Custom View, Filter, and Grouping samples

This section provides examples of custom views, filters, and groupings that you can use in your Adobe Workfront account. Unless otherwise specified, these examples cannot be built just by using the standard mode interface and can be built only by using the text mode interface. For more information about text mode, see [Text Mode overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md).

For additional real-life text mode examples that other Workfront customers might have identified, visit the [Text Mode Reporting Discussions](https://one.workfront.com/s/topic/0TO0z000000cdHmGAI/text-mode-reporting?tabset-21363=3) tab in&nbsp; Adobe Workfront One or join the [Workfront Community](https://one.workfront.com/s/community) (requires logging in). &nbsp;

<p>An Hour view which combines the Task and Issue name columns, as well as the Task and Issue work required (Planned Hours) using the <code>sharecol=true</code> line. This allows you to display the Planned Hours for both Tasks and Issues in one column. Because each hour entry can only be associated with either a Task or an Issue, you always have just one value in the shared column. In the case of an hour entry on a task, the issue reference will be null, and vice versa.</p>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/view-hours-parent-task-information.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">View: hours with parent task information</a> </p>

<p>This Project view displays project information in a two row format. It employs the use of the <code>sharecol=true</code> line to combine multiple fields under the same column header. Additionally, it utilizes place holder columns that hold an HTML line break tag (<br/>) that forces the description to reside below the project name, for example.</p>
<p><a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/custom-view-filter-grouping-samples/grouping-project-percent-breakdown-1.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Grouping: project percent breakdown 1</a> </p>
