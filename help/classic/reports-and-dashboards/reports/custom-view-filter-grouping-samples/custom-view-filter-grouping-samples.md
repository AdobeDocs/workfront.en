This section provides examples of custom views, filters, and groupings that you can use in your Adobe Workfront account. Unless otherwise specified, these examples cannot be built just by using the standard mode interface and can be built only by using the text mode interface. For more information about text mode, see [Text Mode overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md).

<p>An Hour view which combines the Task and Issue name columns, as well as the Task and Issue work required (Planned Hours) using the <code>sharecol=true</code> line. This allows you to display the Planned Hours for both Tasks and Issues in one column. Because each hour entry can only be associated with either a Task or an Issue, you always have just one value in the shared column. In the case of an hour entry on a task, the issue reference will be null, and vice versa.</p>
