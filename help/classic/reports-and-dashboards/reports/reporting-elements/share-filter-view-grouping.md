Your Adobe Workfront administrator grants users access to view or edit objects when they assign access levels. For more information about granting access to objects, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

Along with the access level that users are granted, you can also grant them permissions to view or edit specific objects that you created or have access to share. For more information about access levels and permissions, see [How access levels and permissions work together](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/how-access-levels-permissions-work-together.md).

You can share filters, views, and groupings that you have access to view with other users.

When a filter, view, or grouping is shared with you, you can apply that filter, view, or grouping to your lists. Depending on the access granted to you, you might be able to modify it and share it with other users.

For information about how to create a filter, view, or grouping, see the following articles:

* [Filters overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/filters-overview.md) 
* [Views overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/views-overview.md) 
* [Groupings overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/groupings-overview.md)

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher permissions with access to share to a view, filter, or grouping</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Share a filter, view, or grouping

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: when the beta filters/ groupings come out either consider splitting this in different kinds of FVGs or splitting this article in FVGs for showing sharing on each one of them??)</p>
-->

Sharing filters, views, or groupings in Workfront is identical.

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE)condition this for classic when the paragraph with the bullets below comes to NWE preview)</p>
-->

1. Go to a list of objects or a report.
1. Click the **Filter**, **View**, or **Grouping** drop-down menu, then select the filter, view, or grouping you want to share.
1. Click the **Filter**, **View**, or **Grouping** drop-down menu again, then click **Share Filter**, **Share View**, or **Share Grouping**.  
   The **Filter Access**, **View Access**, or **Grouping Access** dialog box displays.

   ![](assets/share-grouping-user-list-350x360.png)

1. Complete either of the following, depending on who you want to share with:

   **To share with individual users, teams, roles, groups, or companies:** In the provided field, begin typing the name of the user, team, role, group, or company you want to share with, then click the name when it appears in the drop-down list.  
   Repeat this process to share access with multiple users, teams, roles, groups, or companies.

   **To share with all users in the system:** Click the **Settings** icon, then click **Make this visible system-wide**.  
   Your administrator must select the Share System-wide option for this option to be available. For more information, see the articles [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md) and [Share reports, dashboards, and calendars](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/permissions-reports-dashboards-calendars.md).

1. (Conditional) If you are sharing with individual users, teams, roles, groups, or companies, click the drop-down menu to define the level of access you want to grant.

   ![](assets/share-grouping-with-team-view-access-in-list-350x364.png)

   You can select from the following options:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">View it</td> 
      <td> <p>Select this option to allow the share recipients only to use the shared Filter, View, or Grouping. When this option is selected, recipients cannot make any modifications to the shared item.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Manage it</td> 
      <td> <p>Select this option to allow the share recipients to use and modify the shared Filter, View, or Grouping.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Share it</td> 
      <td> <p>Click <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, then select or deselect the <strong>Share</strong> option, depending on whether you want the share recipients to be able to share with others.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **Save**.

   Users with whom you shared the filter, view, or grouping can access it by clicking the **Filter**, **View**, or **Grouping** drop-down menu and scrolling down to the **Shared with me** section.

## Video walk-through

<!--
<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">(NOTE: maybe hide this section when the FVGs are too removed from this UI - especially in the lists and reporting 2.0)</p>
-->

View the following video to learn how to share filters, views, and groupings in Adobe Workfront.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The video describes how to share a grouping. However, sharing views and filters is identical to sharing a grouping.
