# Create groupings in Adobe Workfront

The results of a report or a list can be organized with a grouping. Groupings categorize information based on a particular piece of information.

You can create a custom grouping from scratch or customize an existing grouping. Follow the steps below to create a grouping from scratch.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Reports,&nbsp;Dashboards,&nbsp;Calendars to create a grouping in a report</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## How-to steps

1. Go to the report or the list where you want to create your custom grouping.
1. Click the **Grouping** drop-down menu.

1. Click **New Grouping**.  
   The interface builder for creating the grouping launches.

1. In the **Grouping Preview** section, click **Add Grouping** to define how you want information in the report to be organized. A preview of what the grouping looks like in the report is shown below.

1. Begin typing the name of the field that represents the way that you want to organize information in the report, then click it when it appears in the drop-down list.
1. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to define additional groupings.  
   You can define up to three groupings for organizing information. You can further organize your information with up to four groupings by creating a matrix report. For more information on matrix reports, see [Create a matrix report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-matrix-report.md).

1. Click **Save Grouping**.
