<h2><a name="How-to"></a>How-to steps</h2>
<p>How you remove a reporting element depends on whether you initially created it, or it was shared with you.</p>
<p>For example, when removing a grouping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you created the grouping and you remove it</strong>, the grouping is removed from the Workfront system. The grouping is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with.</li>
<li><strong>If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it</strong>, the grouping is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove a filter, view, or grouping:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1"> <p>Go to a list of objects or a report.</p> </li>
<li value="2"> <p>In the <strong>Grouping</strong>,<strong>Filter</strong>, or<strong>View</strong> drop-down menus, click <strong>Remove Grouping</strong>,<strong>Remove Filter</strong>, or<strong>Remove View</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>My Groupings</strong>,<strong>My Filters,</strong> or<strong>My Views</strong>dialog box displays.</p> <p>All reporting elements that you have rights to remove are available to remove. Other reporting elements are displayed as dimmed.</p> </li>
<li value="3">Click the <strong>x</strong> icon next to any reporting element that you want to remove, then click <strong>Done</strong>.</li>
</ol>

You can remove a filter, view, or grouping from lists and reports if you created them or they have been shared with you. You cannot remove default filters, views, or groupings.

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <col> 
 </col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>View or higher access to&nbsp;Filters, Views, Groupings</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>View permissions with access to share to the filter, view, or grouping you want to remove</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects </a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Considerations about removing filters, views, and groupings

How you remove a reporting element depends on whether you initially created it, or it was shared with you.

The following scenarios exist when you remove a grouping:

* **If you created the grouping and you remove it**, the grouping is removed from the Workfront system. The grouping is no longer available to any users who you previously shared it with.
* **If the grouping was shared with you and you remove it**, the grouping is removed only for you. The user who originally created it and any other users it has been shared with still have access to the grouping.

<p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">You can remove a filter, view, or a grouping for all lists of objects using the standard builder interface. </p>

Removing filters, views, or groupings in Workfront is identical.

1. Go to a list of objects or a report.
1. C lick the **Grouping**,**Filter**, or**View** drop-down menu and select **Remove Grouping**,**Remove Filter**, or**Remove View**.

   The **My Groupings**,**My Filters,** or**My Views** dialog box displays.

   All reporting elements that you have rights to remove are available to remove. Other reporting elements are displayed as dimmed.

1. Click the **x** icon next to any reporting element that you want to remove. 
1. (Conditional) Click **Yes, Delete it** if you selected to delete a filter, view, or grouping that you created and later shared with others.&nbsp;This deletes the filter, view, or grouping from the Workfront system.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >
   >Removing a filter, view, or grouping that you created without sharing it with others removes it from the system without asking for a confirmation.

1. Click **Done**.
