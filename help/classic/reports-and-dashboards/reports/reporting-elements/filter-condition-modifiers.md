The filter and condition modifiers allow you to build filters and establish conditions for formatting your report results.

For more information about building filters, see the article [Filters overview in Adobe Workfront](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/filters-overview.md).

For more information about using conditional formatting in Views, see the article [Use conditional formatting in views](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/use-conditional-formatting-views.md).

## Filter and condition modifiers

For a list of built-in time frame modifiers, see the article [Filter reports by time frames](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/filter-reports-time-frames.md).

Some modifiers are built-in and you can choose them from a drop-down menu inside your filter or conditional formatting statement. Other modifiers can only be used in text mode filters. For more information about understanding text mode, see [Text Mode overview](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/text-mode/understand-text-mode.md).

You can use the following condition modifiers in filters and conditional formatting statements:

  <tr valign="top"> 
   <td> <p> </p> </td> 
   <td> <p><strong>null</strong> </p> </td> 
   <td> <p>The field is either blank, or does not exist. For example, you want to look for items without a parent task ID. This means that you want to see only standalone tasks. The qualifier for the "parent task ID" would be <strong>null</strong>, since a task without an ID (in this case the parent) does not exist. </p> <p>This modifier can only be used in text mode filters.

For example: "cicontains inf" captures any value that contains either "Inf" or "inf".</p> <p> <p>Note: Adobe Workfront searches for the exact word or phrase that you are specifying for each filter statement. For example, if you are searching for any project that contains the phrase "new project" in the name, Workfront does not display projects that have just "new" or just "project", or "new main project" in the name. The filter finds only projects with the exact phrase "new project" in the name.</p> </p> </td>

   <td> <p><strong>in</strong> </p> </td> 
   <td> <p>(Case sensitive) This modifier allows you to create a comma-separated list of variables to compare to a single attribute evaluated in a filter. The entire list is treated as an OR statement and returns any results that meet the criteria of one or more of the variables.</p> <p>For example, when searching for projects, using "in CUR, PLN, CPL" returns all projects that are in the Current, OR Planning, OR Complete status.</p> <p>The built-in modifier <strong>Equal</strong> corresponds to the text mode modifier of <strong>in</strong>. This means that you can choose Equal with multiple values for the field.</p> <p>For example, you are able to choose a "Status equals Current, Planning, Dead" in a project report and you can view projects in any of these statuses.</p> </td> 
  </tr>

   <td> <p><strong>like</strong> </p> </td> 
   <td> <p>(Case sensitive) Searches for portions of a text string in similar fashion to <strong>contains</strong>. However, <strong>like</strong> provides the ability to insert wild card characters to break up the text.</p> <p>For example, when searching for notes, using "like %Current% %Dead%" returns any note that contains the phrase "Current to Dead". It does not include any notes that contain "Dead to Current". Each value is searched in the order it is listed. The % represents a wild card to replace characters or segments of text.</p> <p>This modifier can only be used in text mode filters.
