>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

The Global Navigation Bar changes with the access level you have been assigned by your Adobe Workfront administrator. By default, you are given access only to the areas that include functionality allowed by your access level. To understand the components of the default layout of each access level, see [About the default Adobe Workfront layout](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/about-the-default-wf-layout.md).

## Understand the default Global Navigation Bar of a Worker

As a Worker, your main responsibility is to complete work. The areas in the Global Navigation Bar that are visible to you allow you to do that.

The following areas are included in the default layout of a Worker:

* **Home**: Tasks and issues assigned to you display here. This is the default landing page for a Worker. 
* **Report** **ing** : Reports, dashboards, and calendars that are shared with you display here. For information, see [Reports](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reports-overview.md). 

* **Teams**: Tasks and issues assigned to your teams display in this area. As a Worker, you are the only Workfront user who sees the Teams area by default.

  <!--
  <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">
  This area is named "
  <!--
  People
  -->" for users with a Plan license. As a Worker, you cannot edit users, so the
  <!--
  People tab of this
  --> area is not available to you. You can see the work assigned to your Teams, however, and this is why this
  <!--
  tab
  --> is more accurately renamed to "Teams."
  </MadCap:conditionalText>
  -->

  For information, see [Create and manage teams](../../../people-teams-and-groups/create-and-manage-teams/create-and-mange-teams.md). 

* **Requests**: You can submit requests and review requests you or your team members have submitted here. For information, see [Requests](../../../manage-work/requests/requests-overview.md). 

* **** **Timesheet** : You can access your current, future, or old timesheets here. For information, see [Timesheets](../../../timesheets/timesheets-all.md).

* **Documents**: You can upload documents, or review documents shared with you, here. For information, see [Documents](../../../documents/documents-overview.md).

## Customize your default Global Navigation Bar

You can customize the areas that you see in your Global Navigation Bar by removing or adding areas.

Your Workfront administrator can also modify your Workfront default layout by assigning you a Layout Template.
