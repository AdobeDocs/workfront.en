# Understand a Reviewer's Global Navigation Bar in Adobe Workfront

The Global Navigation Bar changes with the access level you have been assigned by your Adobe Workfront administrator. By default, you are given access only to the areas that include functionality allowed by your access level. To understand the components of the default layout of each access level, see [About the default Adobe Workfront layout](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/about-the-default-wf-layout.md).

## Understand the default Global Navigation Bar of a Reviewer

As a Reviewer, your main responsibility is to review, comment on, and approve work. The areas that are visible to you in the Global Navigation Bar allow you to do that.

The following areas are included in the default layout of a Reviewer:

* My Updates: The My Work area available to users of all access levels is renamed to My Updates for a Reviewer. As a Reviewer, you do not complete work. You need to only see information about work you have to review, comment on, or approve. The My Updates area allows you to perform these actions. This is the default landing area for Reviewers. 
* `Requests`: You can submit and review requests you or other users from your company have submitted in this area.
* `Documents`: You can upload documents, or review documents shared with you here.

&nbsp;

## Customize your default Global Navigation Bar

You can customize the areas that you see in your Global Navigation Bar by removing or adding areas.

For more information about customizing the Global Navigation Bar, see [Customize the Global Navigation Bar in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/customize-global-navigation-bar.md).

Your Workfront administrator can also modify your Workfront default layout by assigning you a Layout Template. For more information about working with Layout Templates, see Create and manage layout templates.
