This article describes how to use the filters in the Home area to view items that you are currently working on or might consider starting to work on.&nbsp;For information about all filters in the Home area, see [Display items in the Work List in the Home area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/display-items-in-home-work-list.md).
