## Schedule work items in your Home Calendar

You can use the Home Calendar to schedule work items for your week.

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;Placing a&nbsp;work item on your Home Calendar does not change the existing dates associated with the work item.

To add a Workfront work item to your calendar:

1. Go to the Home Calendar view, as explained in [View the Home Calendar](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/view-home-calendar.md).

   All the work items assigned to you or your groups, teams, or job roles display in the left panel. You can sort the list and filter it to display only certain items.

   For more information, see [Filter and sort work items](#filter-and-sort-work-items)&nbsp;later in this article.

1. From the left panel, drag the work item to the day and time when you want to work on it.

   If you schedule yourself to work on an item after its planned completion date or for more time than the number of hours it's planned for, the work item displays in red and a warning appears.

   To learn about work item due dates and how they affect allocated time in the Home Calendar, see&nbsp; [Home Calendar view](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/home-calendar-view.md).

1. Do any of the following:

   * **To schedule a work item for multiple days:** Repeat step 2 to add the item to each day and time when you want to work on it.
   * **To modify the duration of a calendar item:**&nbsp;Hover over the bottom edge of the item until the cursor becomes a double arrow, then drag the bottom edge to the ending time you want.
   * **To delete a calendar item:** Hover over the item, then click the trashcan icon that is displayed.

## Update a work item on your Home Calendar

You&nbsp;can make updates to work items that display in Home Calendar view. Your updates also appear on the Updates tab of the actual work item.

1. Go to the Home Calendar view, as explained in [View the Home Calendar](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/view-home-calendar.md).  

1. Open the Details panel for the work item you want to update:

   * From the left panel: Select the work item,&nbsp;then click **Details**.
   * From the calendar: Click the scheduled calendar event.

   Details for the work item display in a panel that appears on the right of the window.

   ![](assets/click-cal-item-to-see-details-350x217.png)

1. Do any of the following to update the work item:

   * In the&nbsp;**Start a new update**&nbsp;box, type your update, specify any of the following information, then click **Update**.

     <table>
      <col>
      <col>
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td role="rowheader">Notify</td>
        <td><p> Tag users you want to notify about your update. For more information, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md" class="MCXref xref">Tag others on updates</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td>

       <tr data-mc-conditions="">
        <td role="rowheader">Commit Date</td>
        <td>In the drop-down calendar, select the date when you are committing to complete the work item. For information about setting the Commit Date, see <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/overview-of-commit-dates.md" class="MCXref xref">Commit Date overview</a>.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr data-mc-conditions="">
        <td role="rowheader">How's this going?</td>
        <td>Select a new condition for the task or issue. For information about task and issue conditions, see <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/updating-work-in-a-project/update-condition-for-tasks-and-issues.md" class="MCXref xref">Update Condition for tasks and issues</a>.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td role="rowheader">Private to my company</td>
        <td>Disable to prevent users outside your company from being able to view this update.</td>
       </tr>
      </tbody>
     </table>

   * Click the current **Status** for the item, then click a new status in the list that appears. For more information, see [Approval process overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approval-process-in-workfront.md).

     >[!NOTE]
     >
     >If you mark a work item assigned to you as Complete - Pending Approval, you may notice that it no longer appears on your calendar. This is because no further action is expected of you until the user who is set to approve the item marks it as Approved. When this occurs, you will be able to see the item on your calendar as an Approved item.

   * (Optional) To reply to an existing comment or update, click **Reply**, specify any recipients in the **Notify** box, type your reply, then click **Reply**.  
     If you need information about specifying recipients, see [Tag others on updates](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/tag-others-on-updates.md).
