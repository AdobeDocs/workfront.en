# Try the Home area

The Home area is no longer in beta and is now the default in the Production environment. However, you still have the option to switch back to My Work.

Your Adobe Workfront administrator can enable a setting in the Layout Template to revert users back to My Work. For more information, see the section&nbsp; [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md) in the article&nbsp; [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

## Access requirements
