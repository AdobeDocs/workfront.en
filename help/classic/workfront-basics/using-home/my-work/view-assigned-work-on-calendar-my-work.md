## Understand how&nbsp;tasks and issues are displayed&nbsp;in the calendar

* Work that is assigned specifically to you is displayed. (This does not include work assigned to a team you are on.)&nbsp;  
  Completed tasks are removed from the calendar.
* By default, a 14-day&nbsp;period (including weekends) is displayed on the calendar, starting with the current day.  
* Task and issue duration is visually represented on the calendar (tasks and issues span the number of days equal to&nbsp;the duration).  
* The project where the task or issue resides is visually represented by color. Each project is assigned a color; any tasks from a single project are displayed in the same color.
* Time off is represented on the calendar with a gray indicator.

## Configure issues to be displayed on the calendar

By default, issues are not displayed on the calendar in the My Work area. To configure issues to be displayed on the calendar in the My Work area:

   ![](assets/calendar-mywork-expanded-adobe-350x272.png)

   Team assignments are not displayed.  
   If you have Manage access to the task or issue, you can modify the hours for which users are allocated on each day within the task or issue duration.
