# My Updates area

Only for users with a Review license, the My Updates area takes the place of the My Work or Home page available to users with other license types (see [Adobe Workfront licenses overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/wf-licenses.md).)

The My Updates area displays the following information:

* **Any items awaiting approval**. These display at the top of the screen so review users can easily see which items they need to approve or reject. For more information about approving items, see [Approving work in Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/approving-work.md).

  You can view the following types of approvals by applying the following filters to this area:

  | All |Approvals that are submitted to you or delegated to you by another user. For information about delegating approvals, see [Delegate approval request](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/delegate-approval-requests.md).  |
  |---|---|
  | Delegated Approvals |Approvals delegated to you by another user.  |
  | My Approvals |Approvals submitted to you.  |

* **Updates**. These display when another user includes a user with a Review license on a directed update. For more information about updates, see [Update work](../../../workfront-basics/updating-work-items-and-viewing-updates/update-work.md).

Although users with a Review license can be assigned tasks, they do not receive email or other notifications regarding assignments, and they cannot mark them as "Done".

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the Adobe Workfront administrator includes the My Work area in a layout template, users with a Review license see the My Updates page instead.

To access the My Updates area:

1. In the Global Navigation Bar, click **My Updates**.
