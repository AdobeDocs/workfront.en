To change the date format for the dates in Adobe Workfront, such as Planned Completion Date, Actual Completion Date, or Project Completion date, from DD/MM/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY or vice versa, you must change the language settings in your browser.

If your default is set to *English (United States)*, the dates will appear in the MM/DD/YYYY format.

To change your language settings in Chrome:

1. Click the 3-dots in the top right corner of your Chrome interface, then click **Settings**.
1. On the left area of the Settings page, expand **Advanced**, then click **Languages**.  
   Or  
   Search for *language*&nbsp;at the top of the Settings page, then click **Languages**.

1. In the **Language** list, locate the language and region that use your preferred date format.

   ``` ```**Example: **``````If you speak English and you want the date format to be MM/DD/YYYY, you would select **English (United States)**. If you speak English and you want the date format to be DD/MM/YYY, you would select **English (United Kingdom)**.

1. (Conditional) If the language and region you want to use are not visible in the list, click **Add languages** to add it to the list.
1. Click the 3-dot menu next to the language and region you want to use, then click **Move to the top**.
1. Return to the Workfront interface, then refresh the page.  
   The date format is now updated in projects and other areas of Workfront that use MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY format when displaying dates.
