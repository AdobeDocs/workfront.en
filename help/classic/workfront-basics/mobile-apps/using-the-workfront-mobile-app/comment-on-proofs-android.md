## Review existing comments in a proof

You can review comments that are made on a proof document. Comments often have associated drawings to call out the area of the document the comment refers to. Drawings can include arrows, lines, rectangles, highlighting, and freehand drawings.

1. Open the document proof. For information, see [Review and make decisions on proofs in the Adobe Workfront mobile app](../../../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/work-with-proofs-in-mobile-app.md).
1. Select a comment icon on the document page ![Comment icon on document](assets/mobile-comment-icon-on-proofdoc-30x34.png) to open the comment and any associated drawings.

   If the comment has more than one reply, you can select **View Replies** to show all replies, or swipe the comment sheet up and down to display more content.

1. To reply to the comment, type your response in the text box underneath the comment and select the **Send** icon ![Send icon](assets/mobile-send-icon-25x26.png).

### Use the comment list

1. To see a list of all comments in order by page number, select the comment icon ![Comment icon](assets/mobile-comment-icon-30x25.png) on the top right.

   The number of unread comments is indicated on the comment icon. ![Number of unread comments](assets/mobile-unread-comments-icon-30x27.png) Unread comments in the list are marked with a blue dot.

   You can undo the resolution by selecting the resolved comment and selecting the **Undo** icon on the top right.
