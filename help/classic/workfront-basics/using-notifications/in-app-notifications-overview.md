This article lists the in-app notifications you can receive. In-app notifications keep you informed about two types of information: announcement notifications and work item notifications. They are available from both the web application and the mobile application.

For instructions on how to view and manage these notifications, see [View and manage in-app notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/view-and-manage-in-app-notifications.md).

* [Announcement notifications](#announcement-notifications) 
* [Work item notifications](#work-item-notifications)

## Announcement notifications {#announcement-notifications}

```<li>Announcements come in one of two ways:</li>```

* Workfront sends a message to the Announcement page of your organization's Workfront administrators  
* A Workfront administrator sends a message to users from the Announcement page

In both cases, when the administrator or user clicks the numbered icon ![](assets/notifications-icon-jewel.jpg) in the upper-right corner of Workfront to open their list of notifications, the subject line of the message displays with a megaphone icon and the word "Announcement."

For information about the Announcements page, see [View and manage in-app notifications](../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/view-and-manage-in-app-notifications.md).

## Work item notifications {#work-item-notifications}

When you click the numbered icon ![](assets/notifications-icon-jewel.jpg) in the upper-right corner of Workfront to open your list of notifications, the subject line of the work item message displays with an icon and brief description to identify what it's about. The icon and description types are listed below.
