# Supported languages in Adobe Workfront

You can change the language in which you display Adobe Workfront and emails coming from Workfront, by adjusting the language preferences on your browser and your default Locale within Workfront.

Workfront terminology is updated for the supported languages with every Workfront update.

Workfront supports the following languages:
