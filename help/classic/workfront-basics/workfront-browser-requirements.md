# Adobe Workfront browser requirements

Both Adobe Workfront and Workfront Proof require the use of an internet browser. The supported browser versions are as follows:

* `Web browser:`&nbsp;Workfront officially supports the current browser version and one previous version (and any previous version that constitutes at least five percent of total Workfront traffic) for the following browsers: &nbsp;&nbsp;

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Workfront supports only the 100% zooming option for all supported browsers. This also includes the zoom settings in your computer's operating system.

  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari
  * Microsoft Edge (Not Microsoft Edge Legacy)

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    >Internet Explorer 11 is no longer supported as of the 21.2 release. Microsoft discontinued all support (including severe security vulnerabilities) for IE 7 and&nbsp;IE 8 on January 12, 2016. In addition, IE 9 and IE 10 have also been discontinued in most circumstances.&nbsp;Microsoftâ€™s rationale behind this decision was&nbsp;based on the substantial security concerns with the architecture of these browsers that could severely impact users.  
    >For more information, see the [Internet Explorer Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer)&nbsp;on the Microsoft Support site.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The Workfront One website is no longer supported when using Internet Explorer.

* `Browsers on a mobile device:` Workfront does not support any browsers on a mobile device. Instead, use the Workfront mobile apps, available for both iOS and Android. For more information, see [Use the Adobe Workfront mobile app](../workfront-basics/mobile-apps/using-the-workfront-mobile-app/use-the-mobile-app.md).

  <!--
  Adobe Flash Plugin: Version 10.1 or greater. Proofing users must have version 11.1 or greater. The Adobe Flash Plugin is required in order for certain legacy areas of the Workfront interface to function (such as the Resource Grid, Resource Budget Manager, Capacity Planner, and the Legacy Gantt Chart). If you are using these legacy tools in Workfront, you must configure your browser to allow the Adobe Flash Plugin to be used on your Workfront site, because most browsers are configured by default to block the use of the Adobe Flash Plugin.
