# Removal of various single sign-on options

Adobe Workfront is removing support for various single sign-on (SSO) options. The end result will be a consistent and more secure sign-in experience across all Workfront products and services.

The following SSO options are now supported only in a limited capacity; they will be removed from the product in 2020:

* LDAP

  For more information about using LDAP with Workfront, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with LDAP](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/configure-workfront-ldap.md).

* Active Directory

  For more information about using Active Directory with Workfront, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with Active Directory](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/configure-workfront-ad.md).

* SAML 1.1

  For more information about using SAML 1.1 with Workfront, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 1.1](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/single-sign-on/configure-workfront-saml-1.1.md).

For more information about how you can expect SSO to work in the future when using Workfront, see [Enhanced Authentication overview](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/get-started-enhanced-authentication.md).
