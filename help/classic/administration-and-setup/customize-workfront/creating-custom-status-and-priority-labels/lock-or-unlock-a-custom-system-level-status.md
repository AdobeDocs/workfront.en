# Locking or unlocking a custom system-level status

Locking custom statuses is a way to ensure that people are using the same processes in their flow of work. When a status is locked, it’s available to all users ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  in the system </MadCap:conditionalText>```. Though you can still edit or delete a status that you lock, group administrators can’t do so for ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  their </MadCap:conditionalText>``` groups; they can change only its display order in the Status list.

Conversely, unlocking custom statuses allows group administrators more flexibility to manage the unique workflows used in their groups. When a status is unlocked, group administrators can change its attributes or delete it for ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  their groups </MadCap:conditionalText>```.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you lock a custom status after it has been unlocked for any period of time, your ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  system-wide </MadCap:conditionalText>```settings for the status replace those made by group administrators. While the status is locked, group administrators cannot modify or delete the status for their groups.
