# Create and customize priorities

You can control the priorities for&nbsp;projects, tasks, and issues in the Setup area of Workfront. Priorities give importance to your projects, tasks, or issues in Adobe Workfront.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Customizing existing priorities

As a Workfront administrator, you can&nbsp;make the following modifications to the default priorities provided in Workfront:

* Rename priorities.
* Reorder the priorities.

  For more information on how to reorder priorities, see [Create a priority for a project task, or issue](#create-a-priority-for-a-project-task-or-issue).&nbsp;

* Change the default priority.

  For more information on the functionality of changing the default priority, see [Create a priority for a project task, or issue](#create-a-priority-for-a-project-task-or-issue).

* Edit the description for the priorities.&nbsp;
* Set a color for each priority.

  The color of the priority is used in chart reports, when you group your results by **Priority**.

  For more information on chart reports, see [Add a chart to a report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/add-chart-report.md).

* Delete priorities.

  When you delete an existing priority, you must select a replacement one.

* Hide priorities.

  For more information on the functionality of hiding priorities, see [Create a priority for a project task, or issue](#create-a-priority-for-a-project-task-or-issue).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must have at least one priority in your Workfront account for each object.

The priorities provided by default for each object type (project, task, and issue) are identical:

* None
* Low
* Normal
* High
* Urgent

## Create a priority for a project task, or issue {#create-a-priority-for-a-project-task-or-issue}

In addition to the default priorities provided in&nbsp;Workfront, you can add your own priorities to reflect the needs of your organization.

1. Click **Setup** near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.  

1. In the left panel, click **Project Preferences** > **Priorities**.

1. Click the tab for the object type you want to create a priority for (**Project**, **Task**, or **Issue**).
1. Click **Add a New Priority**.
1. Specify&nbsp;the following information for the new priority:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Priority Name</td> 
      <td>Type a name for your priority.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Importance</td> 
      <td> <p>When adding a new priority, a number is assigned to it&nbsp;by default. Edit this number, if it does not match your needs.</p> <p>The <strong>Importance</strong> number for each priority must be unique for the object you selected.<br>The number of the priority&nbsp;reflects the importance&nbsp;of the project, task or issue: the highest number corresponds to the highest priority.</p> <p>Note: &nbsp;You cannot edit the Importance number, after you save the priority.&nbsp;</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Color</td> 
      <td> <p>Choose a color for your priority.</p> <p>The color of the priority is used in chart reports and Agile Team Settings.&nbsp;For more information on chart reports, see <a href="../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/add-chart-report.md" class="MCXref xref">Add a chart to a report</a>.</p> <p>For more information on Agile Team Settings, see in&nbsp;.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Default Priority</td> 
      <td> <p>Decide whether this should be a default priority&nbsp;or not, by selecting the radio button.</p> <p>If a priority is designated as the <strong>Default Priority</strong>, it is automatically picked&nbsp;for all the projects, tasks, or issues in Workfront. <strong>Normal</strong> is the default priority for all objects in Workfront.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Description</td> 
      <td>Add a description for your priority&nbsp;to explain its function.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Hide</td> 
      <td> <p>Select this box if you want to hide&nbsp;the priority.<br>When you select&nbsp;the <strong>Hide</strong> option, the priority does not display anywhere in Workfront and users are not able to choose it for their projects, tasks, and issues.</p> <p>Important: &nbsp;We recommend that you hide the priorities that you no longer want to use, rather than deleting them.&nbsp;By hiding them, you still keep all your historic data, of objects that have been completed with this priority, while preventing people from choosing this priority&nbsp;in the future.&nbsp;</p>(Optional) You can change the listing order of your priorities by&nbsp;dragging and dropping them in your desired order. This changes the order in which they display&nbsp;for projects, tasks, and issues. This does not change the <strong>Importance</strong> number.&nbsp;</td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>
