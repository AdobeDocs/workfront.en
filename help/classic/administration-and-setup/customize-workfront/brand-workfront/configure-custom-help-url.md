When users access Help in Adobe Workfront, they are automatically routed to the Workfront help site, [one.workfront.com](https://support.workfront.com). As a Workfront administrator, you can configure an additional help URL so that they can also access a help site of your choice from Workfront.

For example, if you have an internal site containing special information about how your organization uses Workfront, you can link to that site from the Workfront interface.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A custom help URL added to the Workfront user interface does not affect the main Help link in the Global Navigation Bar and the context-sensitive help links throughout Workfront, which take users to the Workfront Help site.

For information about how users access both regular Help and a custom help URL that you configure in Workfront, see [Access Adobe Workfront help](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/workfront-navigation/access-workfront-help.md).

## Configure a custom Help URL

1. Click **Setup** near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.
1. Click **System** > **Preferences**.

1. In the **General Preferences** section, in the **Custom Help URL** field, type the URL where your custom help site is located.

   If your custom help location requires login credentials, those credentials are required for users when they access the site from Workfront. The credentials to your custom help site might need to be managed separately from the Workfront credentials if you do not have a single sign-on solution in place.

1. Click **Save**.
