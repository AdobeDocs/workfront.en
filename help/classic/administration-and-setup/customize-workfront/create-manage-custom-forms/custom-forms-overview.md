## Custom fields and widgets

Workfront provides many built-in fields for each object type. In a custom form, you can create additional fields that prompt users for information that is unique to their workflows. These custom fields are the building blocks of a custom form.

You can add the following types of custom fields to a custom form in Workfront:

* Single line text field
* Paragraph text field
* Text field with formatting 
* Dropdown
* Calculated
* Date
* Checkboxes
* Radio buttons
* Descriptive text
