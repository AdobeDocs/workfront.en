# Add a custom field to a custom form

When you are working on a custom form, you can create a new custom field and add it to a custom form.

You can also add a custom form that is already created in your system. For instructions, see [Reuse an existing custom field](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/reuse-an-existing-field.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront plan*</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Administrative access to custom forms</p> <p>For information about how Workfront administrators grants this access, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-users-admin-access-certain-areas.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant users administrative access to certain areas</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr>  
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access level configurations you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Add a custom field to a custom form {#add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form}

1. Begin creating or editing a custom form, as described in [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).
1. Open the **Add a field** tab.

   ![](assets/add-a-field-350x175.jpg)

1. With **New Field** selected, select one of the field types listed below:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Single Line Text Field</td> 
      <td>Allows users to type a single line of text in the field.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Paragraph Text Field</td> 
      <td>Allows users to type multiple lines of text in the field.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
      <td role="rowheader">Text Field with Formatting</td> 
      <td> <p>Allows users to type multiple lines of text in the field and format the text with bold, italics, underline, bullets, numbering, hyperlinks, and block quotes. This is available in Home, the Updates area, lists, and the Details area for Workfront objects. A character limit of 15,000 allows for plenty of text and formatting.</p> <p>For information about accessing this field through the API, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/rich-text-field-storage-in-the-api.md" class="MCXref xref">Rich text field storage in the API</a>.</p> <p>Note:    In lists throughout Workfront, you can't inline edit custom fields with rich text formatting. Text fields with formatting are not available for Workfront mobile apps (available in coming releases). </p> <p>Important:   <p>For the best performance in large lists where objects contain formatted text fields, limit the number of shown objects to 250 in the lower right corner of the window.</p> <p> <img src="assets/limit-list-objects-250-350x154.png" style="width: 350;height: 154;"> </img> </p> </p> </td>

     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Section Break</td> 
      <td> <p>You can use a section break to organize your fields into sections and, if necessary, configure different viewing and editing permissions for each section.

     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. On the **Field Settings** tab, configure the options that are available for the type of field you are adding:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <col> 
    </col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr>

      <td> <p>(Required) Type a descriptive label for the custom field. It displays above the custom field when users view the field on a custom form added to an object.</p> <p>You can change the label at any time.</p> <p>Important: Avoid using special characters in this label. They don't display correctly in reports.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Name</td> 
      <td> <p>(Required) This name is how the system identifies the custom field when you add it to various areas throughout Workfront, such as reports, Home, and API interactions.</p> <p>When you are configuring the custom field for the first time and you type the label, the Name field populates automatically to match it. But the Label and Name fields are not synchronizedâ€”this gives you the freedom to change the label that your users see without having to change the name that the system sees.</p> <p>Important:   
        <ul> 
         <li> <p><span>Though it's possible to do so, we recommend that you do not change this name after you or other users start using the custom form in Workfront. If you do, the system will no longer recognize the custom field where it might now be referenced in other areas of Workfront.</span> </p> <p><span>For example, if you add the custom field to a report and later change the custom field's name, Workfront doesn't recognize the custom field in the report and the custom field will stop functioning correctly there unless you re-add it to the report using the new name.</span> </p> </li>  
        </ul> </p> <p>Each custom field name must be unique in your organization's Workfront instance. This way, you can reuse a custom field already created for another custom form. </p> </td>

     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. (Conditional) To change the display type of a field on the custom form, click the **Display Type** drop-down menu, then click the type you want.

   You can switch between the following field display types:

   * **Selection-type fields**: Checkboxes, Dropdown, Radio Buttons.
   * **Text-type fields**: Single Line Text Field, Paragraph Text Field. (You canâ€™t switch a Text Field with Formatting to a different display type. However, you can remove it and add another type of field.)

   For example, if you have created a Checkboxes field, you can change it to a Dropdown field or a Radio Buttons field. Or, if you have created a Single Line Text Field, you can change it to a Paragraph Text field.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Consider the following when you want to change a field's display type from a checkbox field or a multi-select dropdown field (a dropdown allowing more than one option to be selected) to a single-select field type:
   >
   >   
   >   
   >   * If you change to Radio Buttons, Workfront retains any multi-select values that a user may have entered in the field until the user changes and saves data in any part of the form. At this point, any values that were selected using the multi-select-type field are replaced by the selected Radio Button value.
   >   * If you change to a single-select Dropdown, Workfront retains any multi-select values that a user may have entered in the field until the user changes and saves the values in the field. At this point, any values that were selected using the multi-select-type field are replaced by the selected Dropdown value.
   >   
   >

1. (Optional) Repeat steps 2-6 to add other custom fields.

   Or

   Add fields that have already been created for your organization, as explained in [Add a custom field to a custom form](#Add).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can add up to 500 fields on a single custom form. However, performance degradation can occur when more than 100 fields exist on a form, depending on the complexity of the form. Examples of complex forms include forms with cascading parameters, calculated custom data fields, and multiple value options in a single field.
