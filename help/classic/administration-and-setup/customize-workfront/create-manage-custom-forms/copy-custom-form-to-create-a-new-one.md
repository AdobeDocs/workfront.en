# Copy a custom form to create a new one

You can create a new custom form that is based on an existing one.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront plan*</p> </td> 
   <td>Any</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr data-mc-conditions=""> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Administrative access to custom forms</p> <p>For information about how Workfront administrators grants this access, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-users-admin-access-certain-areas.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant users administrative access to certain areas</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access level configurations you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Copy a custom form to create a new one

1. Click **Setup** near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.
1. Click **Custom Forms.**
1. Select the custom form that you want to use as the basis for a new custom form, then click **Copy**.
1. In the **Custom Form Copy** box that appears, type the following information:

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Form Name</td> 
      <td>Specify a new name for the custom form.</td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Form Type</td> 
      <td> <p>Select which object type that you want to associate the custom form with. The object type that you select is the only object type to which the form can be applied.</p> <p>Note:  You can change the object of the form as you are copying a custom form. This is helpful when you want to create an identical form for two different objects. For example, you can copy an Issue custom form and create a Project custom form which has the same fields and the same logic as the original Issue form.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. Click **Copy Form**.
1. Select the form that you just copied, then click **Edit**.
1. Make any changes to the form, as explained in the following articles:

   * [Copy a custom form to create a new one](#add2) 
   * [Add calculated data to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-calculated-data-to-custom-form.md) 
   * [Position fields in a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/position-fields-in-a-custom-form.md) 
   * [Using an existing calculated custom field on a new custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/use-existing-calc-field-new-custom-form.md) 
   * [Display logic and skip logic on a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/display-or-skip-logic-custom-form.md) 
   * [Preview and complete a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/preview-and-complete-a-custom-form.md)

1. (Optional) After you click **Save+Close**, attach the form to the object where you want to use it, as described in [Add a custom form to an object](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/add-a-custom-form-to-an-object.md).

   The custom form must be associated with the type of object you want to attach it to. For more information, see [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).
