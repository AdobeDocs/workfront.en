# Associate projects and templates with companies

A project or a template cannot be associated with more than one company. But there is no limit to how many projects or templates you associate with one company.

One of the benefits of associating projects with companies is that you can report on project financials for each company.

## Access requirements

You must have the following in order to manage companies in Workfront:

<table cellspacing="0">

   <td>Team or higher</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p>Adobe Workfront license*</p> </td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> Access level configurations* One of the following: The System Administrator access level, which allows you to edit any company in the system.
