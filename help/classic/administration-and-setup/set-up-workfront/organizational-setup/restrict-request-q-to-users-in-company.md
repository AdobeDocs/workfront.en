# Restrict request queue to users in the associated company

When using a project as a request queue, you can allow only users from the company associated with this project to see the request queue in their **Requests** area of Workfront.

For more information about setting up a project as a request queue, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

Alina recommended that we draft this because the functionality is already documented in the article "Create a request queue." If we decide we want it back, she'd like it to move to the Manage Work area.
