title: Locking or unlocking a custom group status
description: Locking a group’s custom statuses is a way to ensure that people are using the same processes in their flow of work. When a group status is locked, it’s available to all users in lower groups . Though you can still edit or delete a status that you lock, group administrators can’t do so for those groups; they can change only its display order in the Status list.

# Locking or unlocking a custom group status

Locking```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  a group’s </MadCap:conditionalText>``` custom statuses is a way to ensure that people are using the same processes in their flow of work. When a ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  group </MadCap:conditionalText>```status is locked, it’s available to all users ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  in lower groups </MadCap:conditionalText>```. Though you can still edit or delete a status that you lock, group administrators can’t do so for ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  those </MadCap:conditionalText>``` groups; they can change only its display order in the Status list.

Conversely, unlocking```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  a group’s </MadCap:conditionalText>``` custom statuses allows group administrators more flexibility to manage the unique workflows used in their groups. When a ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  group </MadCap:conditionalText>```status is unlocked, group administrators```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  of lower subgroups </MadCap:conditionalText>``` can change its attributes or delete it for ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  those subgroups </MadCap:conditionalText>```.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you lock a custom status after it has been unlocked for any period of time, your settings for the status replace those made by group administrators```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  in lower subgroups </MadCap:conditionalText>```. While the status is locked, ```<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.groups">  those administrators </MadCap:conditionalText>``` cannot modify or delete the status for their groups.
