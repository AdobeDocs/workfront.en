# Manage a group

As a group administrator, you can manage a group that you administer. If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you are assigned as the administrator for a group, you inherit the group administrator role for any subgroups that are below it. The only users who can manage a subgroup are the group administrators for the top group above it and any group administrators who are assigned to the subgroup.

## Manage a group’s memberships

You can add to and remove users and other groups from a group you administer. You can also assign group members as administrators for the group and manage the user profile information of group members.

For instructions, see [View and manage a group’s memberships](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-manage-a-groups-memberships.md).

## Manage a group’s details

You can view and manage the main details for a group you administer. These include the group’s name, description, Business Leader, and group administrators. If you are viewing a top-level group, you can also make the group and all of its subgroups public or private. For instructions, see [View and manage a group’s details](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-manage-a-groups-details.md).

## Edit, copy, or delete a group

1. Click `Setup` near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.
1. Click `Groups`.

   In the list of groups that displays, group administrators can see the groups they manage, as well as any subgroups of those groups. Adobe Workfront administrators can see all groups.

1. Select the group, then click Edit, More > Copy, or More > Delete.

   If you need information about using the box that displays, see one of the following:

  * `Edit`: [View and manage a group’s details](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-manage-a-groups-details.md)
  
  * `Copy`: [Create a top-level group by copying an existing group or subgroup](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/create-a-group.md#copying-an-existing-group-and-sub-group) in the article [Create a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/create-a-group.md)
  
  * `Delete`: [Delete a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/delete-a-group.md)

## Configure project, task, and issue preferences for a group

If you are a group administrator and your group needs different project, task, and issue preference settings from those that are set on the system level, you can ask the Workfront administrator to unlock a preference for all groups throughout the organization. After it is unlocked, you (and group administrators for all other groups) can configure it for the groups you manage.

For instructions, see [Configure project preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-project-preferences-group.md) and ` [Configure task and issue preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-task-issue-preferences-group.md)` `.`

## List, add, and configure subgroups

You can create, view, edit, copy, rename, export, and delete subgroups beneath a group you administer.For instructions, see Manage a subgroup.

## Configure event notifications for a group

If a Workfront administrator unlocks the ability to configure event notifications for the groups in your organization, you can configure them for a group you administer. For instructions, see [View and configure event notifications for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/view-and-configure-event-notifications-group.md).

## Create and customize statuses for a group

As a group administrator, you can create custom statuses for a top-level group that you manage. This gives your group autonomy and helps to eliminate the need for dozens of company-wide custom statuses. (A Workfront administrator can also do this, for any group.)

You can also customize system statuses for a top-level group if a Workfront administrator has configured them to allow customization.

For instructions, see [Create or edit a group status](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/create-or-edit-a-group-status.md).
