# View and manage a group’s memberships

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can view, add, remove, export, activate, and deactivate members of any group that you manage. You can also edit their profiles, add Updates to their profiles, and assign them as additional group administrators for the group.

If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> <p>You must be a group administrator of the group or a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## View and manage a group’s memberships

1. Click **Setup** near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.
1. Click **Groups**.

   In the list that displays, Workfront administrators can see all top-level groups and subgroups. Group administrators can see top-level groups and subgroups for which they are listed as a group administrator, as well as any subgroups of those groups.

1. Click the name of the group where you want to view and manage memberships.
1. In the **Edit Group** box that displays, do any of the following:

   * To add members or groups to the group, click **Add people or groups**, start typing the name of an existing user or group you want to add , then click the name when it appears.

     The users and groups that you add have access to all objects shared with the group.
   
   * To assign a group member as an administrator for the group, click the drop-down menu to the right of the user’s name, then click group administrator.

     A top-level group must have at least 1 group administrator.
   
   * To find a user or group already assigned to this group, click **Search people and groups in the list**, start typing their name, then select it when it appears.
   * To remove a user or group from the list, click the X to the right of their name.

1. Click **Save** when you are finished.
