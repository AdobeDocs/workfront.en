# Delete a group

You can delete a group that you manage. If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for Workfront administrators (for any group).

For information about deleting a subgroup, see [Manage a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/manage-a-group.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> <p>You must be a group administrator of the group or a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

   You can make sure you are selecting the right group by hovering over it and clicking the information icon ![](assets/info-icon.png) that displays next to it. This displays a tooltip listing information about the group, such as the hierarchy of groups above it and its administrators.
