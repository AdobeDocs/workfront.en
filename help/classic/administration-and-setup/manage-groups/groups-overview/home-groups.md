# Home Groups overview

>You're currently viewing the Adobe Workfront Classic version of this document. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. All Adobe Workfront Classic functionality, along with this documentation, will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the the new Adobe Workfront experienceas soon as possible, and switch to the new Adobe Workfront experience version of this document.

A Home Group is assigned in the user's profile. All users are required to have a Home Group. A user can belong to more than one group, but they can have only one Home Group. For more information about Groups, see [Groups overview](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/groups-overview/groups.md).

Although any existing group in the system can be assigned as a user's Home Group, we recommend creating and assigning new groups that represent larger organizational units.

When establishing Home Groups, consider how your organization divides your Adobe Workfront users. Here are a few suggestions to determine what type of groups should be used as a Home Group:

* Groups that represent departments, such as IT or Marketing
* Groups governed by different budgets
* Groups located in different areas or regions
* Groups made up of multiple teams that belong to the same cost center

>1. Create the new group, as explained in [Create a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/create-a-group.md).
>1. Reassign the new group as the user's Home Group, as explained in [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

## Layout Template management

When you assign a Layout Template to a group, all users that have the group assigned as their Home Group can see the settings specified in the Layout Template.

If a Layout Template is assigned to a Home Group, it is only visible to users assigned&nbsp;to that Home Group.

For more information, see [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md) in [Create and manage layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/use-layout-templates/create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).

## License management

Each user can be assigned to only one Home Group, which makes it easier to manage license counts.

Workfront administrators have the option to set maximum license counts for the Home Groups.

Setting a max license count allows Workfront administrators to prevent a business unit from using Workfront licenses purchased for other business units.

For more information, see [Manage available licenses in your system](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/manage-available-licenses-in-your-system.md).
