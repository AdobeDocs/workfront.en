As the Adobe Workfront administrator, sometimes you might need to access Workfront on behalf of another user.

Or, as a group administrator, you might need to access Workfront on behalf of a user who is a member of a group you manage.

For example, if a task can’t progress until a user on vacation performs a certain action, you can log in as that user and perform the action instead.

<!--
<note type="note">
Some users, such as executives, need to be able to control which administrators can log in to their accounts, and for how long. Working with your organization, Workfront configures settings that allow this control for these users. When a Workfront administrator or group administrator (associated with one of the user’s groups) tries to log in as one of these users, an on-screen message prompts the administrator to contact the user for access. From the user profile area, the user can then grant access to the administrator and specify an expiration time for it. For more information on how the user does this, see
<a href="../../../workfront-basics/manage-your-account-and-profile/configuring-your-user-profile/configure-my-settings.md#access" class="MCXref xref">Access</a> in

## Tracking and auditing activity while an administrator is logged in as another user

Workfront provides mechanisms for tracking and auditing activity that takes place while the administrator is logged in as another user.

When you log in as another user, the last login date is modified for that user to the date when the system or group administrator logs in as that user.

* [View indicators on items](#view-indicators-on-items) 
* [View audit information](#view-audit-information)

### View indicators on items {#view-indicators-on-items}

When you log in to Workfront as another user and perform an action, Workfront clearly indicates that any action you perform is made by you on behalf of the user who you are logged in as.

For example, if you comment on an item while logged in as another user, a statement indicates that the comment was made by you on behalf of the user.

### View audit information {#view-audit-information}

1. Log in to Workfront as a Workfront administrator or group administrator.
1. Click **Setup** near the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront on the Global Navigation Bar.
1. Click **Log in As,** then click the **Access Log** tab.

   Any time a system or group administrator logs in to Workfront as another user, the event is logged in the audit trail. In addition, any auditable actions that take place while the administrator is logged in as another user are logged in the audit trail.

1. (Optional) You can filter the results that are displayed in the audit trail in the following ways:

   * By user who has logged in
   * By user who has been logged in as
   * By date
