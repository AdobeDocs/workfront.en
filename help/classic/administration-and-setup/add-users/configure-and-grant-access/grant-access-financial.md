# Grant access to financial data

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can define a user’s access to the following through the user's access level, as explained in [Access levels overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-levels-overview.md):

* Financial information on projects in Workfront
* Resource budgeting information in the Resource Planning tools

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Considerations for granting access to financial data

Consider the following when granting users access to financial data in Workfront:

* A user whose access level doesn't allow access to financial data cannot create a risk for a project. For more information, see [Create and edit risks on projects](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-edit-risks-on-projects.md).
* You can also use an access level to determine which Resource Management activities a user can employ to budget or view resource allocation. For information, see [Grant access to Resource Management](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-resource-management.md).

## Configure user access to financial data using a custom access level

1. Begin creating or editing the access level, as explained in [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).
1. Click the gear icon ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png) on the `View` or `Edit` button to the right of Financial Data, then select the abilities you want to grant under **Fine-tune your settings**.
1. (Optional) In the `Allow administrative access for` area, select the following options:<![CDATA[]]>

   <table cellspacing="0"> 
    <col> 
    <col> 
    <tbody> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Exchange rates</td> 
      <td> <p>Add new currency in Workfront.</p> <p>Without this access, the user can only add an existing currency to a project they create.</p> </td> 
     </tr> 
     <tr> 
      <td role="rowheader">Expenses</td> 
      <td> <p>View all expenses on objects in Workfront.<br></p> <p>This does not allow the user to create new Expense Types.<br></p> <p>Without this access, the user can only view the following:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Expenses on projects, tasks or issues they manage</li> 
        <li>Their own expenses</li> 
        <li>The expenses of their subordinates</li> 
       </ul> </td> 
     </tr> 
    </tbody> 
   </table>

1. (Optional) To configure access settings for other objects and areas in the access level you are working on, continue with one of the articles listed in [Configure access to Adobe Workfront](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/configure-access.md), such as [Grant access to tasks](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-tasks.md) and [Grant access to financial data](#).
1. When you are finished, click Save Changes.

   After the access level is created, you can assign it to a user. For more information, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).

## Access to shared financial information

You can share financial information on a project, task, or issue with other users by granting them permissions to it, as explained in [Share financial permissions on an object in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-financial-permissions-object.md).

When you share any object with another user, the recipient’s rights on it are determined by a combination of two things:

* The permissions that you grant to your recipient for the object
* The recipient’s access level settings for the object's type

## Access to financial information by license type

For information about what users in each access level can do with financial information, see the section [Financial data](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md#financia) in the article [Functionality available for each object type](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md).
