# Power BI Modules

`Adobe Workfront Fusion` requires an `Adobe Workfront Fusion` license in addition to an `Adobe Workfront` license.
Introduction: Fusion is not a data source. It uses and creates data sources. Power BI runs reports on data sources, NOT&nbsp;on Fusion.

&nbsp;

Power BI is an application that allows you to visualize and present data to your stakeholders. It can take data from a variety of sources.

>[!NOTE]
>
>`Workfront Fusion` is not a data source. While `Workfront Fusion` can create and use data sources, it does not store your data.
