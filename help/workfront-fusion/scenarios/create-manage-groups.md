The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.


As a `Group Administrator`, you can use the Groups page to organize your group's users and projects, assign their access rights within `Workfront`, and configure the settings for the group. `Workfront administrators` can also do this (for any group).


If you need information about how groups work within `Workfront`, see [Groups](groups.md).
