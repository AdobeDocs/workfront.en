Following is a list of functionality that is not yet available, but will soon be available in the new *Adobe Workfront* experience Beta Preview environment. This is not a comprehensive list of functionality yet to be released with the new Workfront experience.

### Cannot configure a custom Help URL

You cannot configure a custom help URL, as described in [Configure a custom help URL](../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/brand-workfront/configure-custom-help-url.md).

### Currency field always shows dollar format

The Currency field always shows the dollar sign ($) regardless of the currency that is selected.

### Number field format does not take into account local formatting

The Number field format when displaying currency does not take into account local formatting, such as dots for US format and commas for European format.

### Default landing pages not available

All users see Home as their default page after logging in.

### Cannot assign users to a story in agile by dragging the user avatar

On the Kanban or Scrum story board, you cannot assign users to a story card by dragging the user avatar to the card.

### New custom tabs are not yet available on Reports, Dashboards, and Requests

Custom tabs are available as new left side navigation items on all objects except for Reports, Dashboards, and Requests.

### Calendar selector doesn't close in IE&nbsp;11

In Internet Explorer 11, the calendar selector for all date fields does not have a background and does not close after you select a date.

To work around this, press escape. This cancels the dialog box and allows you to click away.

### Cannot change the status of a copied project in the Teams area

When you copy a project in the Teams area, you cannot change the status in the Copy dialog box.

To work around this, change the project status after it has copied.

The Calendars option is missing from the Main menu.

### Cannot move stories or issues from one iteration to another

When you're in a current, upcoming, or past iteration, the Move to.. button under the More drop-down menu opens the incorrect dialog box.

### Add to Iteration button missing on Task and Issue landing pages

When you have a task or issue and an Agile team is assigned, you can't add it to an iteration using the Task/Issue Actions drop-down menu.

To work around this, select the task or issue from the task or issue list on the project, then click More > Add to > Iteration.
