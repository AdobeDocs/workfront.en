# Create a milestone path

As an *Adobe Workfront administrator*, you can create milestone paths in the Setup area of *Workfront* which can then be applied to any project in the system. The changes you make to milestone paths in this area affect the entire *Workfront* system.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Plan</em> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a <em>Workfront administrator</em>. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <em>Workfront administrator</em> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <em>Workfront administrator</em> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td>

## Milestones and milestone paths

You can associate the key tasks in a project with predefined milestones. This function can provide managers and other stakeholders with a high-level overview as to how a project is progressing.

The sum of all the predefined milestones is called a milestone path.&nbsp;

The first step in building a milestone path is identifying what the milestone steps are and establishing the milestones. Because you can associate a milestone path to multiple projects, the milestone steps must be general phases or stages of any project.

For more information on how you can associate a milestone path with a project and a milestone with a task, see [Associate milestones with tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/associate-milestones-with-tasks.md).
