# Custom conditions {#custom-conditions}

A condition is a visual representation of how a project, task, or issue is progressing. As an *`Adobe Workfront administrator`*, you can use the conditions created by *`Workfront`* for use in projects, tasks, and issues, or you can create custom conditions to more closely match the needs of your organization.
