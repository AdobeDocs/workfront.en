# Set a custom condition as the default for projects

If the Condition Type of a project is set to Progress Status instead of Manual, *Adobe Workfront* automatically displays one of three built-in default conditions on the project (On Target, At Risk, or In Trouble) as it progresses, as explained in [Overview of Project Condition and Condition Type](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/project-condition-and-condition-type.md).

You can set your custom conditions as default conditions instead of using these three built-in default conditions. For example, you could change the On Target default condition to display as Tracking Well in all projects.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:
