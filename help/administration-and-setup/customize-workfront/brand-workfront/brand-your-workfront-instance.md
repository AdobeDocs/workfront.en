Click the Main Menu icon in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click Setup . Click System > Branding. Make any of the following changes to customize Workfront with your branding images. Brand the Home icon (displays at the far left of the top navigation area) In the Top navigation area section, under Home icon, click anywhere in the box, then find and select your logo image. Or drag an image to the box. To crop the image, use the scrolling controls and drag the image to the position you want inside the prescribed space. We recommend a 120 x 120 image. It can be in any of the following formats: GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG. This icon also appears in reports, lists, dashboards, and delivered reports that users export as PDF files. Brand the Main Menu logo (displays in the upper-right corner of the Main Menu) In the Top navigation area section, under Main Menu logo, click anywhere in the box, then find and select your logo image. Or drag an image to the box. To crop the image, use the scrolling controls and drag the image to the position you want inside the prescribed space. We recommend a 300 x 120 pixel image. It can be in any of the following formats: GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG. Brand the login screen logo (displays in the top-left of the box where users type login credentials) Under Login Screen, click anywhere in the box, then find and select your logo image. To crop the image, use the scrolling controls and drag the image to the position you want inside the prescribed space. We recommend a 300 x 120 pixel image. It can be in any of the following formats: GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG. Brand the login screen background color (displays behind the box where users type login credentials) Under Login Screen, set a Background Color. You can use RGB or HEX color codes. The background color is visible only if the login screen background is larger than the login screen background image (see the next row in this table) or if there is any transparency in the image. Brand the login screen background image (displays behind the box where users type their login credentials) In the Login Screen area, under Background Image, click the box, then find and select your JPG or PNG image or images (up to 20 ). Multiple background images display in random order, changing each time users refresh their login page. We recommend images no larger than 2 MB. Hover over each background image you have uploaded, click the Settings (gear) icon, and use any of the following options to specify where and how you want the image to appear in the login screen background: Fill Screen: Fits the image to the login screen background, which may enlarge the image. Use a high-resolution image (up to 2 MB) for the best results. When you use this option, the Workfront banner, which is not customizable, obscures part your image. Tile: Tiles your image across the login screen background area, in its original size. This is useful for creating a pattern. Select a blue alignment option to start the tiling from the top-left corner, top-center, or top-right of the background area. Position: Places your image in its original size in the position you choose using one of the blue alignment options: the top-left, top-center, or top-right of the login screen background area. The background color fills the rest of the login screen background area. For more about the background color, see the preceding row in this table. Reset to the default branding Resetting to the default branding deletes all photos and images that you have uploaded. Click Reset all branding to Workfront defaults in the lower-right corner of the screen, then click Yes. Note: This is not available if your organization’s Workfront instance uses a custom SSO portal or is enabled with Adobe IMS. See your network or IT administrator if you need more information. Click Save.
