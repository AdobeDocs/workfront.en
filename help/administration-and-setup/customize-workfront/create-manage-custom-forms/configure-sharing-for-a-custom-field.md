## Inherited access to custom fields when a custom form is shared

When someone shares a custom form with a group, job role, team, or company, the recipients inherit View access to any custom fields that are on the form. This level of access to the fields on the form is always retained so that the form can function for the recipients as intended by the person who created it. This is true even for recipients who have Edit access to the form.

You can find out who has inherited access to a field and you can remove access to a shared field.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a recipient has Manage access to a custom field on the shared custom form, that access is retained for the recipient.
