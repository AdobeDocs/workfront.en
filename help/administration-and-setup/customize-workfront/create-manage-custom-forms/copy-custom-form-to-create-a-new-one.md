## Copy a custom form to create a new one

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Click the <span class="bold">Main Menu</span> icon <img src="assets/main-menu-icon.png"> in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront, then click <span class="bold">Setup</span> <img src="assets/gear-icon-settings.png">.</li> 
 <li value="2">Click <span class="bold">Custom Forms.</span></li> 
 <li value="3">Select the custom form that you want to use as the basis for a new custom form, then click <span class="bold">Copy</span>.</li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>In the <span class="bold">Custom Form Copy</span> box that appears, type the following information:</p> 
  <table cellspacing="0"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Form Name</td> 
     <td>Specify a new name for the custom form.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Form Type</td> 
     <td> <p>Select which object type that you want to associate the custom form with. The object type that you select is the only object type to which the form can be applied.</p> <note type="note">
        You can change the object of the form as you are copying a custom form. This is helpful when you want to create an identical form for two different objects. For example, you can copy an Issue custom form and create a Project custom form which has the same fields and the same logic as the original Issue form.
