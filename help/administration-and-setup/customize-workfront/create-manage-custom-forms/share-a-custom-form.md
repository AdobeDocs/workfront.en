If you create a Custom Form or have access to share it, you can share it in two main ways:



*  **With a group**: This gives members of the group access to edit the Custom Form if they have **Custom Forms in my group** enabled in their access level. For more information, see [Assign users administrative access](assign-users-administrative-access.md).


  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >When you create a Custom Form, it is shared automatically with your Home Group.



* **With people, roles, teams, and companies**:&nbsp;This gives your recipients access to attach the Custom Form to objects and use it.
