## Start editing a custom form

You can edit a custom form any time after it has been created. 

` `**Warning: **`` For information about removing fields from a custom form without losing data that users have entered in those fields, see the section [Remove fields without losing data](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/delete-a-custom-field.md#remove) in the article [Delete a custom field](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/delete-a-custom-field.md).

In general, we recommend minimizing the number of times you edit a custom form that is already in use. There is no notification system to alert people who use the custom form about your changes.
