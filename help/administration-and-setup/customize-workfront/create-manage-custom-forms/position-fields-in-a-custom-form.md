## Position fields in a custom form

1. Begin creating a custom form and add fields, as described in [Create or edit a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md) and [Add a custom field to a custom form](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/add-a-custom-field-to-a-custom-form.md).

1. (Optional) To position fields on the same row, drag one field next to the other until a line appears between them.

   When you drop the field, a gray box displays around the two fields to indicate that they share a row on the custom form.

   You can use the `Preview` button in the lower-right corner to see the fields as they will appear in the form.

1. (Optional)To position a field above or below another field, drag it above or below the field until a horizontal blue line appears between the fields.
1. Continue on to [Position fields in a custom form](#add3).
