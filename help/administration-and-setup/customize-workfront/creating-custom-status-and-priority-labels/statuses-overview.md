# Statuses overview {#statuses-overview}

To find out what the current state of development is for a project, task, or issue, a user can view its status.


For example, in this project, the status Planning indicates that the projectâ€™s manager is currently planning aspects of the project such as its timeline, task assignments, and approvals.

Changing the status of a project, task, or issue is usually a manual process. However, there are times when the status of an issue is changed automatically, depending on other factors happening in the system.


*`Workfront`* comes with 9 project statuses, 3 task statuses, and 10 issue statuses. For details about these, see [Access the list of system project statuses](project-statuses.md), [Access the list of system task statuses](task-statuses.md), and [Issue statuses](issue-statuses.md).


## Creating custom statuses {#creating-custom-statuses}

In addition to the default statuses that come with *`Workfront`*, a *`Workfront administrator`* can add custom project, task, and issue statuses to match the needs in your organization. You can create system-wide statuses used by everyone in your *`Workfront`* instance, or group statuses used by only certain groups. For more information, see [Create or edit a status](create-or-edit-a-status.md).


*`Group administrators`* can also do this to meet the needs of their groups. For more information, see [Create or edit a group status](create-or-edit-a-group-status.md).
