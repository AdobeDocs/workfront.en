# Statuses overview

To find out what the current state of development is for a project, task, or issue, a user can view its status.

For example, in this project, the status Planning indicates that the projectâ€™s manager is currently planning aspects of the project such as its timeline, task assignments, and approvals.

Changing the status of a project, task, or issue is usually a manual process. However, there are times when the status of an issue is changed automatically, depending on other factors happening in the system.

Workfront comes with 9 project statuses, 3 task statuses, and 10 issue statuses. For details about these, see [Access the list of system project statuses](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/project-statuses.md), [Access the list of system task statuses](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/task-statuses.md), and [Access the list of system issue statuses](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/issue-statuses.md).

## Creating custom statuses

In addition to the default statuses that come with Workfront, a Workfront administrator can add custom project, task, and issue statuses to match the needs in your organization. You can create system-wide statuses used by everyone in your Workfront instance, or group statuses used by only certain groups. For more information, see [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).

Group administrators can also do this to meet the needs of their groups. For more information, see [Create or edit a group status](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/create-or-edit-a-group-status.md).
