# Customize Home and Summary using a layout template

You can use a Layout Template to configure what users see when they click a task or issue in Home and in the Summary. Each configuration you make using the steps below affects the Home area and the Summary panel in the same way. These customizations don't apply to the Document Summary panel.

You can configure:

* What fields display for a task or issue in the Details area, and in what order
* Whether updates, logged time, attached documents, and timestamps display for a selected task or issue

You can also customize the fields that users see in the Home area when users click a project approval, document approval, or document version approval that is assigned to them.

For information about the Home area, see [Use the Home area](../../../workfront-basics/using-home/using-the-home-area/use-the-home-area.md).For information about the Summary panel, see Summary overview in the new Adobe Workfront experience.

For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a groupâ€™s layout templates](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).
