# Testing a new layout template {#testing-a-new-layout-template}

It's important to test the newly or layout template before assigning it to users.


For more information about layout templates, see [Create and manage layout templates](create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).


For information about layout templates for groups, see [Create and modify a groupâ€™s layout templates](create-and-modify-a-groups-layout-templates.md).


## Test a new layout template {#test-a-new-layout-template}

You can test your layout template in either of the following ways:



* Assign the template to your own user account and verify that it meets all requirements. For instructions, see [Assign a layout template to users](assign-users-to-layout-template.md#assign).
* Log in as a user who is assigned to the layout template. For instructions, see [Log in as another user](log-in-as-another-user.md).


After you have tested your layout template and you are satisfied that it will work well for your users, continue with [Grant administrative access for a layout template](grant-admin-access-layout-template.md).


For more information about layout templates, see [Create and manage layout templates](create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).
