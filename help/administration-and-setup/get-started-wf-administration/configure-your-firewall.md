# Configure your firewall {#configure-your-firewall}

If your firewall or mail server is configured to allow access to only certain vendors, you must add certain IP addresses to its allowlist. This opens communication between your environment and the *`Adobe Workfront`* servers and allows the following processes:



* Sending messages from the *`Workfront`* application
*  Using single sign-on (SSO) with Active Directory or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
* Using document webhooks when configuring custom document integrations
*  Using *`Workfront`* Event Subscriptions


  For more information, see [Event Subscription API](https://experience.workfront.com/s/article/Event-Subscription-API-2100945680).  




You also need to open certain ports in order for email messages to be encrypted when they are delivered.


>[!TIP] {type="tip"}
>
>If your organization uses the *`Enterprise`* plan, you can configure the *`Workfront`* email allowlist to control where users can email data stored in *`Workfront`*. For more information, see [Configure your email allowlist](configure-your-email-allowlist.md).

## IP addresses to add to the allowlist  {#ip-addresses-to-add-to-the-allowlist}

The IP addresses that you must add to your allowlist on your firewall depend on the cluster where your Production environment runs. You can find out which cluster this is by viewing Setup > System > Custom Info. For more information, see the section [Configure Basic Info](configure-basic-info.md#configuring-basic-info) in the article [Configure basic information for your system](configure-basic-info.md).


>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}

>Some *`Workfront`* integrations do not work when the allowlist is enabled because they canâ€™t be configured with a static IP address. To use the following integrations, you must disable the allowlist.
