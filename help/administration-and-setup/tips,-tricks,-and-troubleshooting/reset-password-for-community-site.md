# Reset the password for the Community site {#reset-the-password-for-the-community-site}

This process allows you to change your password for `Workfront Community` if you use SSO for your Workfront instance (which means that `Workfront Customer Support` created a `Workfront Community` account for you). If you don't use SSO with your `Workfront` account, use your existing `Workfront` credentials to log in.


>[!NOTE]

>
>
>* Your instance of Workfront is not associated with this `Workfront Community` login. 
>* The steps below change your password only for the `Workfront Community` site, not for the Help site or the Training site.
