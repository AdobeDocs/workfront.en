# Active and deactivated objects {#active-and-deactivated-objects}

As a `Workfront administrator`, you can activate or deactivate objects within the system. We recommend that administrators never delete the objects which they can deactivate. The administrator should simply deactivate the object to prevent future use and to remove it from the drop-down menus of other objects.


For example, in order to see a certain Hour Type, the Hour Type must be active. An inactive or disabled Hour Type does not appear in the Hour Type drop-down menu, but remains in the system to keep the historical record intact of where this Hour Type might have been used in the past.


The term 'Active' is used to identify whether certain objects are enabled in the system. In this context, 'Active' is used for the following objects:


## Email notifications {#email-notifications}

You can activate email notifications to allow for certain actions to trigger email notifications for all users.


For information about activating or deactivating email notifications, see [Enable and disable event notifications](enable-and-disable-event-notification.md).
