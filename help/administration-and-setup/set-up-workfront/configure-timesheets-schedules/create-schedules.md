# Create a schedule

As an `Adobe Workfront administrator`, you can define your work week by using schedules. You can associate a schedule with a user or a project. This allows `Workfront` to calculate timelines and user availability.

For information about associating schedules with users and projects, see the following articles:

* [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md) 
* [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md)

`Group administrators` can also create schedules that are associated with the groups they manage. For more information, see [Create and modify a groupâ€™s schedules](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/work-with-group-objects/create-and-modify-a-groups-schedules.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr>

   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license</td>

If you only have one, that is designated as the default schedule.</p> <note type="note">
    You cannot designate a schedule as the default schedule if you are a group administrator. Only a
