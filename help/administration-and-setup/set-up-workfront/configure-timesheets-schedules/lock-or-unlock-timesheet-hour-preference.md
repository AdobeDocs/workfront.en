# Locking or unlocking a system-level timesheet and hour preference {#locking-or-unlocking-a-system-level-timesheet-and-hour-preference}

Locking a preference`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  that you have configured at the system level</MadCap:conditionalText>` ensures that everyone`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  throughout the system</MadCap:conditionalText>` is using the same setting for that preference. Though you can still reconfigure a preference that you lock, *`group administrators`* canâ€™t do so for `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level"> their groups</MadCap:conditionalText>`.


Conversely, unlocking a preference`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level">  that you have configured at the system level</MadCap:conditionalText>` allows *`group administrators`* more flexibility to manage the way their groups work with those items. When a preference is unlocked, *`group administrators`* can reconfigure it for `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="SnippetConditions-wf-groups.system-level"> their groups</MadCap:conditionalText>`.


For instructions on locking or unlocking a system-level project, task, or issue preference, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](set-project-preferences.md) or [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](set-task-issue-preferences.md).
