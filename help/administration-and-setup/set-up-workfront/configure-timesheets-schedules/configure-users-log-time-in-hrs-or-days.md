# Configure users to log time in hours or days {#configure-users-to-log-time-in-hours-or-days}

Users with a Planner license can configure whether they log time in *`Adobe Workfront`* in hours or days. As a *`Workfront administrator`*, you can configure this setting for individual users or full multiple users in your organization. By default, users log time in hours.


For information about configuring users to log time in hours or days, see [Configure whether time is logged in hours or days](config-time-logged-hrs-days.md).
