# System-tracked updates {#system-tracked-updates}

*`Adobe Workfront`* captures the activity taking place on certain objects by logging status information in the object's Updates area.


The Updates area includes the following types of updates:



*  `User updates:` Manually entered by users. Also referred to as comments, replies, and notes.

* `System updates:` Automatically made by the system. A system update includes a brief note describing what kind of change happened to the item. 


The following objects can have updates:



* Project
* Task
* Issue
* Portfolio
* Program
* User
* Templates
* Template tasks
* Documents
*  Timesheets  



  Timesheets do not have an Updates area. The Update Status feed is located at the bottom of the timesheet.



Your *`Workfront`* license determines whether system updates display by default in the Updates area of objects. *`Workfront`* users with a Plan license have system updates displayed in the Updates area by default. However, users can filter out system updates, as described in the [Enable or disable system updates](update-work.md#enable) section in [Update work](update-work.md). All other *`Workfront`* licenses filter system updates by default.


*`Workfront administrator`*s can define what type of changes the system should track in the Updates area. Not all objects have configurable update status feeds. The following objects have an Updates area that captures system-tracked update feeds, but do not have configurable update status feeds:



* Templates
* Template tasks
* Documents
* Timesheets


For more information about system update feeds and how to enable them, see [Configure system updates](configure-system-updates.md). `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> For more information about configuring user updates, see  <a href="configure-preferences-user-updates.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure preferences for user updates</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText>`
