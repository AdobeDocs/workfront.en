# Restrict request queue to users in the associated company

When using a project as a request queue, you can allow only users from the company associated with this project to see the request queue in their `Requests` area of `Workfront`.

For more information about setting up a project as a request queue, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

<!--
Alina recommended that we draft this because the functionality is already documented in the article "Create a request queue." If we decide we want it back, she'd like it to move to the Manage Work area.
-->

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Plan</span> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Restrict request queue to users in the associated company

1. Go to the project which you set up as a request queue.
1. Ensure that the project is associated with a company.

   For information on associating a project with a company, see [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

1. Click Queue Details in the left panel. 
1. In the `Queue Type` section, select  `People in this project's company`, then click `Save`.
