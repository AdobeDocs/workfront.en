# Override job role billing rates at the company level

When a job role is created, you have the option to select an hourly billing rate for that role. You can create an hourly billing rate that is specific to a company.

At the project level, you can enable an option to allow company-level billing rates to override project-level rates. For more information, see [Override Project-Level Billing Rates with Company-Level Billing Rates](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/override-project-level-with-company-level-billing-rates.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Plan</em> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Administrative access to Companies if you are not a System Administrator</p> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Financial&nbsp;Data</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <em>Workfront administrator</em> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <em>Workfront administrator</em> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.
