# Delete job roles

You can delete job roles that your organization no longer uses. We recommend that you do not delete job roles if they have been associated with work items in the past. `To keep all your historical information about work assignments, we recommend that you deactivate roles, rather than delete them when they become obsolete. For information about deactivating roles, see [Deactivate job roles](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/organizational-setup/deactivate-job-roles.md).`

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Plan</em> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Administrative access to Job roles</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <em>Workfront administrator</em> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <em>Workfront administrator</em> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>
