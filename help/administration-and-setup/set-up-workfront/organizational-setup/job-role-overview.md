# Job role overview {#job-role-overview}

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.


A job role represents a functional capacity or a skill set a user might fill. This article describes the various uses of job roles in  *`Adobe Workfront`*. 

For more information about managing job roles, see the following articles:



*  [Create and manage job roles](create-manage-job-roles.md) 
*  [Delete job roles](delete-job-roles.md) 
*  [Deactivate job roles](deactivate-job-roles.md) 


You can use job roles for the following purposes: 



*  You can associate a user with job roles to indicate the skills they are able to perform. You can associate a user with multiple job roles. For information, see [Add users](add-users.md) and [Edit a user's profile](edit-a-users-profile.md). 
*  You must associate users with job roles when using the *`Workfront`* resource management tools. In some cases, this is a prerequisite to managing your resources in *`Workfront`*. For information, see [Get started with Resource Management](get-started-resource-management.md). 
*  You can add job roles to Resource Pools. All users associated with the roles added become part of the resource pool. For information, see [Work with Resource Pools](work-with-resource-pools.md). 
*  You can use job roles as place-holders for assigning them to work items when you don't know yet who might be able to complete the work. 


  For example, we recommend that you associate tasks with job roles when creating templates, when it's not yet clear which user might be later assigned to the actual work. For information, see the following articles:

    
    
    *  [Create a project template](create-template.md) 
    *  [Assign tasks](assign-tasks.md) 
    *  [Assign issues](assign-issues.md) 
    
    

*  You can associate job roles with project, task, or issue approval processes and any of the users who can fulfill the job role can make a decision on the approval. For more information, see [Create an approval process](create-approval-processes.md).
*  You can share the following objects with job roles:

    
    
    *  Projects
    *  Tasks
    *  Issues
    *  Portfolios
    *  Programs
    *  Templates
    *  Template tasks
    *  Reports
    *  Dashboards
    
    
      For information about sharing objects, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md). 
    
    
    

*  You can associate job roles with routing rules when building request queues.&nbsp;For information, see [Create Routing Rules](create-routing-rules.md). 
*  You can assign layout templates to job roles. Anyone that has the assigned job role as their Primary Role can view *`Workfront`* according to the assigned layout template. 


  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If users are assigned a layout template to their user profile that template takes precedence over the one assigned to their primary job role.&nbsp;For more information, see [Assign users to a layout template](assign-users-to-layout-template.md). 



*  You can assign job roles to plans and initiatives to manage the availability of your resources when using the *`Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner`*. This requires an additional license for the *`Scenario Planner`*. For more information, see [Get started with the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](get-started-with-scenario-planning.md). 
*  `You can override job role rates based on different currencies, when working with resources from different countries. This allows you to obtain more accurate Cost and Revenue amounts for work items.`
