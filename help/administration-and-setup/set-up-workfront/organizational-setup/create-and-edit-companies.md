# Create and edit companies {#create-and-edit-companies}

A company is an organizational unit in *`Adobe Workfront`* that can represent your organization, a department within the organization, or a client you work with. You can add companies to *`Workfront`* and use them for financial planning, reporting purposes, to define permissions around objects, and to keep information confidential.


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following in order to manage companies in *`Workfront`*:

## Benefits of adding users to a company {#benefits-of-adding-users-to-a-company}




* You can build a company's organization chart by associating users with direct reports. Only users from the same company can be added as direct reports of another user from that company.
* As a project manager, you can identify available resources within the same company.
* You can keep information private between companies by choosing one or all of the following settings:
*  `<li> <p>Users from the same company can see each othersâ€™ requests.</p> <p>For more information about how a <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.AdminWF variable varname">Workfront administrator</span> can give similar access to requests based on users' company, see the section <a href="set-task-issue-preferences.md#changing-task-and-issue-preferences" class="MCXref xref">Configure task and issues preferences for everyone in Workfront</a> in the article <a href="set-task-issue-preferences.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure system-wide task and issue preferences</a>.</p> <p>For more information about how a <span class="mc-variable WFVariables.AdminGroup variable varname">group administrator</span> can give similar access to requests based on users' company, see <a href="configure-task-issue-preferences-group.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure task and issue preferences for a group</a>.</p> </li>` `<li>Users can see only request queues that are associated with their companies. For more information about restricting visibility of a request queue, see <a href="provide-access-to-request-queues.md" class="MCXref xref">Provide access to request queues</a>.</li>` `<li>You can restrict users to only see users in their company or their company and the primary company. For information about the primary company functionality regarding user privacy, see <a href="create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</li>` `<li>Users can restrict updates they make on items to be visible by their company users only. For more information about making an update private to a company, see <a href="update-work.md" class="MCXref xref">Update work</a>.</li>` 





## Create or edit a company in *`Workfront`* {#create-or-edit-a-company-in-workfront}

There is no limit to the number of companies you can add. However, we recommend that you use a limited amount of companies, because there are permissions implications linked to companies: too much fragmentation might interfere with users' visibility to work items.


By default, the company associated with your instance of *`Workfront`* is already created in your *`Workfront`* system and is the primary company. Your company has the same name as your customer name. For more information about your customer information in *`Workfront`*, see [Configure basic information for your system](configure-basic-info.md).


To add or edit a company:



1. Click the `Main Menu` icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of *`Adobe Workfront`*, then click `Setup` ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1.  Click `Companies`.
1.   If you are adding a company, click `New Company`.


   Or


   If you are editing an existing company, select the company, then click `Edit`.

1.  Use the options that display to configure the following information:

## About sharing objects with companies {#about-sharing-objects-with-companies}

Certain permissions are available to users who are associated with a company, as explained in the section [Benefits of adding users to a company](#benefits) in the article [Create and edit companies](#). In addition to these permissions, you can allow users permissions to view, contribute, or edit objects in *`Workfront`* by sharing the object with their company. 


Rather than sharing an object with one individual user at a time, you can share it with their entire company. Each user in the company has the same permissions on that object.


For more information about sharing objects, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md).


## *`Group administrators`* and companies {#group-administrators-and-companies}

When a *`Workfront administrator`* assigns a group to a company, the *`group administrators`* for the group gain Manage access to the company in Setup. This includes access to the Companies page in Setup, where they can see and manage the company associated with their group.


With this access to the Companies page, a *`group administrator`* can assign a group to a company, but it must be a company that the *`group administrator`* created. If the *`group administrator`*â€˜s access level is not configured with administrative access to companies, the Group field is required when the *`group administrator`* creates the companyâ€”itâ€™s bolded title indicates this:


![](assets/manage-company-group-field-req-350x273.jpg)




For information about how users gain administrative access to companies in their access level, see [Grant users administrative access to certain areas](grant-users-admin-access-certain-areas.md).


For information about managing a company in the Setup area, see [Create or edit a company in Workfront](#adding-a-company-to-workfront) in this article.
