# The *`Adobe Workfront`* Custom Refresh Sandbox environment {#the-adobe-workfront-custom-refresh-sandbox-environment}

The Custom Refresh Sandbox is an environment where you can test and work using data from your production environment. Itâ€™s also ideal for running trainings and determining setup functionality.


>[!NOTE]
>
>This is different from the Preview Sandbox, which is also a testing environment that replicates your *`Workfront`* production environment.
>
>
>
>* New features are introduced to the Preview Sandbox before they become available in Production.
>*  New features are not introduced to the Custom Refresh Sandbox before they become available in Production.
>
>
>  Also, there is an additional cost to obtain the Custom Refresh Sandbox that is not required for the Preview Sandbox.
>
>
>  For more information about the Preview Sandbox, see [The Adobe Workfront Preview Sandbox Environment](wf-preview-sandbox-environment.md).

## Refreshing the Custom Refresh Sandbox {#refreshing-the-custom-refresh-sandbox}

The Custom Refresh Sandbox contains your actual production data, it does not refresh until you schedule it to do so. You can schedule a refresh any time is convenient for you, as frequently as once a week.


>[!NOTE]
>
>
>
>
>* You cannot schedule a refresh for the current day. For example, if today is June 1, the earliest day when you can schedule a refresh is June 2.
>* Your Custom Refresh Sandbox always has the same product features as your production environment. However, when you refresh your Custom Refresh Sandbox, it preserves branding only for the login screen background color. The login screen and navigation bar logos are reset to *`Workfront`* defaults, and any branding images you modified prior to the refresh do not display.

## Schedule a refresh of your Custom Refresh Sandbox {#schedule-a-refresh-of-your-custom-refresh-sandbox}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>The duration of the refresh depends on the size of the data being refreshed. During the refresh process, it is critical that your custom refresh sandbox environment is not being used in any way (including API calls and integrations) as this will prevent the sandbox refresh from successfully finishing. *`Workfront`* will disable the custom refresh sandbox environment before it begins but you must end any active sessions to ensure that your sandbox refresh is successful.


After you schedule a refresh of your Custom Refresh Sandbox, you can cancel it by clicking Cancel at the top of the page. You can also reschedule it for a later time.  


>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot schedule automatic sandbox refreshes.





To schedule a refresh of your Customer Refresh Sandbox: 



1. Log in to your Custom Refresh Sandbox.
1. Click `Schedule`in the banner at the top of the screen and select a date from the calendar.
1. Select a date for when you want the refresh to happen, then click `Schedule Refresh`.  





## Switch to Production from the Custom Refresh Sandbox {#switch-to-production-from-the-custom-refresh-sandbox}




1.  Log in to your Custom Refresh Sandbox. 


   For more information about accessing your Custom Refresh Sandbox, see [Access the Custom Refresh Sandbox from your Production environment](#accessing-your-custom-refresh-from-production) or [Access the Custom Refresh Sandbox using a URL](#accessing-your-custom-refresh-sandbox-using-a-url).

1.  Click `Go To Production` in the banner at the top of the screen.


   Remember that work done in the sandbox will not be visible in the production environment, as the transfer of data is unidirectional, from production to your Custom Refresh Sandbox,&nbsp;and not in reverse.





## Receive emails from the Custom Refresh Sandbox {#receive-emails-from-the-custom-refresh-sandbox}

*`Workfront`* disables all email communication from the Custom Refresh&nbsp;Sandbox environment. If you want to receive email notifications from the Custom Refresh Sandbox environment, you must enable this functionality in your user settings. For more information about enabling email notifications in the Custom Refresh Sandbox environment, see [Enable delivery of emails from the Preview Sandbox environment](enable-delivery-emails-from-preview-sandbox-environment.md).




>[!NOTE]
>
>Report delivery and push notifications on the mobile app are always disabled for the Custom Refresh Sandbox environment. Neither you nor the *`Workfront administrator`* can enable report delivery or push notifications for the mobile app when you access the Custom Refresh&nbsp;Sandbox environment.  
>For more information about report deliveries for the production environment, see [Report delivery overview](set-up-report-deliveries.md).For more information about push notifications on the mobile app for the production environment, see the section in .  






## Configure Single Sign-On in the Custom Refresh Sandbox {#configure-single-sign-on-in-the-custom-refresh-sandbox}

If you want to configure your Custom Refresh Sandbox to work with a Single Sign-On solution, you can do so by configuring it separately from your Production environment. The SSO configuration in the Custom Refresh Sandbox is independent from your SSO configuration in the Production environment.  
When you refresh your Custom Refresh Sandbox, the SSO information is not copied from your Production environment to overwrite the Custom Refresh Sandbox configuration.


The steps for configuring single sign-on in the Custom Refresh Sandbox are similar to those for configuring it in the Production environment.  
For more information about configuring *`Workfront`* with SSO, see [Overview of single sign-on in Adobe Workfront](sso-in-workfront.md).


## Intended use and availability {#intended-use-and-availability}

*`Workfront`* Custom Refresh Sandbox environments are not intended for performance or load testing. Rather, use these environments to validate feature functionality with your organization's existing workflows.


*`Workfront`* Custom Refresh Sandbox environments are intended to be always available. Any outage to a *`Workfront`* Custom Refresh Sandbox environment during regular business hours will be a first priority immediately after any Production issues are resolved if any exist. Any outage to a *`Workfront`* Custom Refresh Sandbox environment on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) will be addressed so that the environment is running for business hours on Monday.
