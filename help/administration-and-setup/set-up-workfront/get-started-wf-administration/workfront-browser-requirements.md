# `Workfront` browser requirements {#workfront-browser-requirements}

Both `Workfront` and `Workfront Proof` require the use of some basic software components. The supported versions of those components are as follows:



* **Web browser:**  `Workfront` officially supports the current browser version and one previous version (and any previous version that constitutes at least five percent of total `Workfront` traffic) for the following browsers: 
    
    
    * Chrome
    * Firefox
    * Safari
    * Internet Explorer 11  
    
    
      >[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
      >
      >Consider the following limitations when using Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge:      >
      >    
      >    
      >    * Microsoft discontinued all support (including severe security vulnerabilities) for IE 7 and&nbsp;IE 8 on January 12, 2016. In addition, IE 9 and IE 10 have also been discontinued in most circumstances.&nbsp;Microsoftâ€™s rationale behind this decision was&nbsp;based on the substantial security concerns with the architecture of these browsers that could severely impact users.  
      >      If you are using&nbsp;Internet Explorer 9, a new banner&nbsp;appears. To ensure your browser is up to date click [here](http://outdatedbrowser.com/en) for the latest versions.  
      >      For more information, see the [Internet Explorer Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer)&nbsp;on the Microsoft Support site.
      >    
      >    * `Workfront` does not currently support Microsoft Edge.&nbsp;
      >    
      >    

    
    
    
    * `Workfront` supports only the 100% zooming option for all supported browsers.
    
    

* **Browsers on a mobile device:** `Workfront` does not support any browsers on a mobile device. Instead, use the `Workfront` mobile apps, available for both iOS and Android. For more information, see [Use the Workfront Mobile App](use-the-mobile-app.md).

* **Adobe Flash Plugin:**&nbsp;Version 10.1 or greater. Proofing users must have version 11.1 or greater.  
  The Adobe Flash Plugin is required in order for certain legacy areas of the `Workfront` interface to function (such as the Resource Grid, Resource Budget Manager, Capacity Planner, and the Legacy Gantt Chart). If you are using these legacy tools in `Workfront`, you must configure your browser to allow the Adobe Flash Plugin to be used on your  `Workfront` site, because most browsers are configured by default to block the use of the Adobe Flash Plugin.
