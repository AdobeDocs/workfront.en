# Create a scorecard  {#create-a-scorecard}

A scorecard is used to measure how well a project aligns with the previously established criteria of a portfolio. A scorecard often reflects an organizationâ€™s mission, values, and strategic goals.


Portfolio managers usually define the scorecard questions and answers to ensure they are meaningful and valuable during project prioritization and selection. An *`Adobe Workfront administrator`* builds the scorecards&nbsp;based on the recommendations from&nbsp;portfolio managers.


The questions and answers chosen for a scorecard must be quantifiable in order to provide an alignment value to compare different projects.
