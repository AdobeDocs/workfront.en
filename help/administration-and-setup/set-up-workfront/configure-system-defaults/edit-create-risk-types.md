# Edit and create risk types

Risks are possible events that prevent your project from finishing on time or within budget.

You can add risks to your projects in the planning phase to identify potential obstacles prior to the approval of any work.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>

## Risks types

Risk types are labels you can use for your risks to categorize them for reporting purposes. They are created in the `Setup` area by the Adobe Workfront administrator. After risk types are established in your `Setup` area, they are universal to your system. All project owners can use the same risk types for their projects.

## Edit and create risk types

Some risk types are already in Workfront, by default. To reflect the needs of your organization, you can either edit the existing risk types, or create new risk types.
