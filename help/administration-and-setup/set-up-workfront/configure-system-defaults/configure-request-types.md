# Configure request types

While working on a project, you might discover that unexpected events arise. You can log those unexpected events as issues for a particular project or task. You can also submit requests, which are recorded as issues on a project that is designated as a Request Queue. Issues and requests are used considered to be interchangeable in *Adobe Workfront*.

For information about creating issues in *Workfront*, see [Create issues](../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/create-issues.md). For information about creating requests in *Workfront*, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md). For information about associating Request&nbsp;Types with projects, see [Define Request Types for a project in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/define-request-types-for-project.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

## Set what issue or request types are allowed for a project

You can organize the kind&nbsp;of issues or requests that are logged in *Workfront* by Request Types. This organization is useful for reporting reasons and for helping users understand what kind&nbsp;of unexpected work&nbsp;might occur during the lifetime of a project.

You can specify the type of requests that can be logged on a project when you configure the `Queue Details`&nbsp;area for the project.&nbsp;

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p> <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">
    Click 
    <span class="bold">Projects</span> in the Main Menu. 
    <img src="assets/main-menu-icon.png">
   </MadCap:conditionalText> </p> </li> 
 <li value="2">Click the name of the project to open it.</li> 
 <li value="3"> <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">
   In the left panel, click 
   <span class="bold">Queue Details</span>.
  </MadCap:conditionalText> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>In the <span class="bold">Queue Properties</span> section, select the <span class="bold">Request Types</span> you want for the project.</p> <note type="note">
    You must have at least one request type selected. You can select multiple request types.
  </note> </li> 
 <li value="5"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</p> <p>The request types you specified&nbsp;will be available to select when you enter a new issue on a task or a project, or when you submit a new request to the project.</p> </li> 
</ol>

## Customize the names of the request types

As a *Workfront administrator*, you can configure the names of the request types in your system. The new names are visible in any area of *Workfront* where the `Issue Type` or `Request Type` fields display:

* In the `Queue Details` area of&nbsp;a project that will receive the issues or requests.&nbsp;
* If more than one request type is selected for a Request Queue, in the `New Issue Form` in the `Issue Type` field, when you create a new issue or submit a new request.

  For more information about creating issues in *Workfront*, see&nbsp; [Create issues](../../../manage-work/issues/manage-issues/create-issues.md)

  For more information about creating requests in *Workfront*, see&nbsp; [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).

* On the `Queue Topic Detail` form, when you configure the Queue Topic.  
  For more information about creating Queue Topics, see [Create Queue Topics](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-queue-topics.md).

To customize the names of the request types:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Click the <span class="bold">Main Menu</span> icon <img src="assets/main-menu-icon.png"> in the upper-right corner of <em>Adobe Workfront</em>, then click <span class="bold">Setup</span> <img src="assets/gear-icon-settings.png">.</li> 
 <li value="2">Click <span class="bold">Project Preferences</span> > <span class="bold">Statuses</span>.</li> 
 <li value="3">Click the <span class="bold">Issues</span> tab.</li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>At the top of the <span class="bold">Issues</span> tab, hover over the name of a request type, then click the <span class="bold">Edit</span> icon that appears.<br></p> <draft-comment>
   <p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> <img src="assets/edit-request-type-name-nwe-350x143.png" style="width: 350;height: 143;"> </p>
  </draft-comment><p data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> <img src="assets/edit-request-type-name-nwe-350x143.png" style="width: 350;height: 143;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="5"> <p>In the box that appears, type a new name, then press <span class="bold">Enter</span>.</p> </li> 
</ol>

## Configure issue statuses within different request types

You can associate each request type with different issue statuses. You can also change&nbsp;the order in which the statuses display on an issue, depending on what type of issue it is.&nbsp;

For more information about changing the default order of issue statuses and configuring issue statuses, see the [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md) section in [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md).
