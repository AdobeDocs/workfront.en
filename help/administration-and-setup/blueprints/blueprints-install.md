## Where should I install a blueprint?

You can install your package in any of the following environments:

| Production |Production is your live environment.  |
|---|---|
| Sandbox Preview |The Sandbox Preview is a testing environment that serves as a replica of your live environment and is refreshed each weekend by Workfront. All support packages have access to the Sandbox Preview. For more information, see [The Adobe Workfront Preview Sandbox Environment](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/wf-preview-sandbox-environment.md) |
| Sandbox 1 & 2 |The Custom Refresh Sandbox is a separate testing environment which is refreshed manually by you. There is an additional cost to obtain the Custom Refresh Sandbox. For more information, see [The Adobe Workfront Custom Refresh Sandbox environment](../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/workfront-testing-environments/wf-custom-refresh-sandbox-environment.md). |

>[!TIP]
>
>We recommend first installing the blueprint in a sandbox environment. That way, you can test the blueprint's content and make sure itâ€™s a good fit for your organization without making changes to live data.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Certain blueprints are only available to install in the Preview environment for testing purposes. If you access Preview-only content in your Production environment, Sandbox 1, or Sandbox 2, the install button is not active, and you might see a warning message.  
>Also, the environment switching capability is limited when accessing Preview-only content, even when you are in the Preview environment.
