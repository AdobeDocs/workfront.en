# Access levels overview

As an `Adobe Workfront administrator`, you assign an access level to a user for 2 purposes:

* Every user must have an access level in order to log in and work in `Workfront`. 
* You use the access level to control what a user can see and do with certain `Workfront` objects and areas.

Each of the 6 built-in access levels except one (External User) is attached to one of the 4 `Workfront` licenses: `Plan`, `Work`, `Review`, or `Request`:
