# Access to objects and areas by license type {#access-to-objects-and-areas-by-license-type}

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.


The table below tells you the highest level of access (Edit or View) that each of the *`Adobe Workfront`* licenses allow for the objects and areas in *`Workfront`*. 



*  `View`: The user can review and share items.
*  `Edit`: The user can create, edit, delete, and share items.


  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >When another user shares an object, the sharer can specify permissions that limit their ability to edit it. For more information, see [Overview of sharing permissions on objects in Adobe Workfront](sharing-permissions-on-objects-overview.md). 






&#42; Users with a Request license can view only reports, dashboards, and calendars that are shared with them.


>[!NOTE]
>
>Users with a Review license or a Request license has limited sharing capabilities. For more information, see [Adobe Workfront licenses overview](wf-licenses.md).
>

>External users cannot search for items in *`Workfront`*. They can view documents and calendars that are specifically shared with them. They can also see the users that share items with them.
