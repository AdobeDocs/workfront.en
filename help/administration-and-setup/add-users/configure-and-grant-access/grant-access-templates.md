# Grant access to templates

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can use an access level to define a user’s access to templates, as explained in [Access levels overview](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/access-levels-overview.md).&nbsp;

Only users with a Plan license can have full access to templates.

For information about using custom access levels to manage users' access to other object types in Workfront, see [Create or modify custom access levels](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations</td> 
   <td> <p>You must be a Workfront administrator. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Configure user access to templates using a custom access level

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Begin creating or editing the access level, as explained in <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click the gear icon <img src="assets/gear-icon-settings.png"> on the <span class="bold">View</span> or <span class="bold">Edit</span> button to the right of Templates, then select the abilities you want to grant under <b>Fine-tune your settings</b>.</p> <p> <img src="assets/access-level-to-templates-with-edit-expanded-350x114.png" style="width: 350;height: 114;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>(Optional) To configure access settings for other objects and areas in the access level you are working on, continue with one of the articles listed in <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/configure-access.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Configure access to Adobe Workfront</a>, such as <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-tasks.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Grant access to tasks</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-financial.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Grant access to financial data</a>.</p> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>When you are finished, click Save.</p> <p>After the access level is created, you can assign it to a user. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-variable-override="">Edit a user's profile</a>.</p> </li> 
</ol>

## Access to templates by license type

For information about what users in each access level can do with templates, see the section [Templates](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md#template) in the article [Functionality available for each object type](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/access-levels-and-object-permissions/functionality-available-for-each-object-type.md).

## Access to shared templates

As the owner or creator of an issue, you can share with other users by granting them permissions to it, as explained in [Sharing a template](../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-template.md).

When you share any object with another user, the recipient’s rights on it are determined by a combination of two things:

* The permissions that you grant to your recipient for the object
* The recipient’s access level settings for the object's type
