As a `Workfront administrator`, you can assign other users to be `Workfront administrators` by granting them the System Administrator access level.â€‹


By default, a `Workfront administrator` has access to everything in `Workfront`.


For information on how to grant someone full administrator&nbsp;access, see the section [Grant full System Administrator access to users](grant-administrator-access.md#gr) in the article [Grant administrator access](grant-administrator-access.md).


If you want certain users to manage only certain areas of `Workfront`, you can grant them administrative access to those areas. Only users with a Plan license can be assigned administrative access.


## Grant a Planner administrative access to certain areas of `Workfront` {#grant-a-planner-administrative-access-to-certain-areas-of-workfront}



>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>Each of the default access levels that come with `Workfront` contain the settings that we recommend for that level. It's a good idea to leave these unchanged so that you can refer to them after you have set up your users.
>
>
>So, instead of editing a default access level that comes with `Workfront` (Planner, Requestor, Reviewer, and so on) we recommend that you copy it and then modify the copy.
>
>
>We also recommend that you keep the original name of the access level in the name that you create for the copy. For example, at `Workfront`, we might call the access level for users with a Planner license type "Workfront Planner."
>
>
>For instructions on copying an access level, see the section [Create or edit an access level](create-modify-access-levels.md#creating-new-access-from-existing-access) in the article [Create or modify access levels](create-modify-access-levels.md).
