As the *`Adobe Workfront administrator`*, sometimes you might need to access *`Workfront`* on behalf of another user.


Or, as a *`group administrator`*, you might need to access *`Workfront`* on behalf of a user who is a member of a group you manage.


For example, if a task canâ€™t progress until a user on vacation performs a certain action, you can log in as that user and perform the action instead.


>[!NOTE]

>Since a document integration may connect to private personal files, administrators can't access document integrations while logged in as another user.

## Tracking and auditing activity while an administrator is logged in as another user {#tracking-and-auditing-activity-while-an-administrator-is-logged-in-as-another-user}

*`Workfront`* provides mechanisms for tracking and auditing activity that takes place while the administrator is logged in as another user.


When you log in as another user, the last login date is modified for that user to the date when the system or group administrator logs in as that user.

* [View audit information](#viewing-audit-information) 




### View indicators on items {#view-indicators-on-items}

When you log in to *`Workfront`* as another user and perform an action, *`Workfront`* clearly indicates that any action you perform is made by you on behalf of the user who you are logged in as.


For example, if you comment on an item while logged in as another user, the following icon is displayed next to your comment , along with a statement indicating that the comment was made by you on behalf of the user.


### View audit information {#view-audit-information}




1. Log in to *`Workfront`* as a *`Workfront administrator`* or *`group administrator`*.

1. Click the `Main Menu` icon ![](assets/main-menu-icon.png) in the upper-right corner of *`Adobe Workfront`*, then click `Setup` ![](assets/gear-icon-settings.png).

1.  Click `Log in As,` then click the `Access Log` tab.


   Any time a system or *`group administrator`* logs in to *`Workfront`* as another user, the event is logged in the audit trail. In addition, any auditable actions that take place while the administrator is logged in as another user are logged in the audit trail.

1. (Optional) You can filter the results that are displayed in the audit trail in the following ways: 
    
    
    * By user who has logged in
    * By user who has been logged in as
    * By date
