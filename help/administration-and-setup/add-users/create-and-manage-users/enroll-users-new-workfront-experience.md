# Enroll users in the new `Adobe Workfront` experience

>[!NOTE]
>
>The weekly refresh of the Preview environment does not affect user enrollment in `the new Adobe Workfront experience`.

By default, new users have `Adobe Workfront Classic` as their personal `Workfront` environment. As a `Workfront administrator` or a `group administrator`, you can manually enroll users in `the new Adobe Workfront experience`, or you can manually remove users who are already enrolled.

For more information about the new experience, see [the new Workfront experience page](https://one.workfront.com/s/new-workfront-experience).

` `**Tip: **`` As an `Adobe Workfront administrator` or a `group administrator`, you can change your own `Workfront` environment by doing one of the following:

* Selecting Switch to the new experience from the user menu in the Global Navigation Bar
* Selecting Switch to Classic in the Main Menu.

For more information, see [Switch your admin account to Adobe Workfront Classic](#switch) or [Switch your admin account to the new Adobe Workfront experience](#switch2).
