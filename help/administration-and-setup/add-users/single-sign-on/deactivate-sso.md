# Deactivate single sign-on in `Adobe Workfront`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that are not yet onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

After you deactivate single sign-on (SSO) in `Adobe Workfront`, users need to log in using their `Workfront` credentials. These are the credentials the user originally set up. (If you need to change user credentials, see [Edit a user's profile](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/create-and-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.md).)

>[!NOTE]
>
>This is not available if your organizationâ€™s `Workfront` instance uses a custom SSO portal>
><!-->
>or is enabled with Adobe IMS>
>-->
>. See your network or IT administrator if you need more information.
