# Create and modify a group’s schedules

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with the `schedules` for which the administrators of the group, or one of its subgroups, have administrative access.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for `Workfront administrators` (for any group).

For general information about creating and editing a schedule, see [Create a schedule](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-timesheets-schedules/create-schedules.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>`Group administrators` and users with a Plan license who can edit other users can add a system-level or a group-level schedule to another user when they are editing that user's profile.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Plan</span> </p> <p>You must be a <span>group administrator</span> of the group or a <span>Workfront administrator</span>. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.
