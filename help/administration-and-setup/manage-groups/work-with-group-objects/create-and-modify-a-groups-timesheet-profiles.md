Do this to other step articles about objects and groups? Remove steps and point to main article; add group or step in that article. Already done previously for approval processes.

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with the *timesheet profiles* for which the administrators of the group, or one of its subgroups, have administrative access.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for *Workfront administrators* (for any group).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan</td>

## Create and edit group-level timesheet profiles

You can create and edit timesheet profiles for use in a group you manage. For instructions, see [Create, edit, and assign timesheet profiles](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/create-timesheet-profiles.md).

## Delete group-level timesheet profiles

You can delete timesheet profiles in use by a group you manage. For instructions, see [Delete timesheet profiles](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/delete-timesheet-profiles.md).

## Manually generate group timesheets

To enable changes that you made to group timesheet profiles to reflect&nbsp;in current group timesheets, you have to first delete the existing timesheets and then manually generate new ones. For instructions, see [Manually generate timesheets from the Timesheets area](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/manually-generate-timesheets.md#manually) in [Manually generate timesheets](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/manually-generate-timesheets.md).

For information about on deleting group timesheets, see [Delete generated timesheets](../../../timesheets/create-and-manage-timesheets/delete-timesheets.md).
