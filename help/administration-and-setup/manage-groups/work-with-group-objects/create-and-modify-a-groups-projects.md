# Create and modify a group’s projects

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with its projects in the following ways:

* Create a new project for the group
* Edit, export, copy, or delete a project

If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for *Workfront administrators* (for any group).

##  

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans" target="_blank"><em>Workfront</em> plan</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://one.workfront.com/s/document-item?bundleId=the-new-workfront-experience&amp;topicId=Content%2FAdministration_and_Setup%2FAdd_users%2FAccess_levels_and_object_permissions%2Fwf-licenses.html&amp;_LANG=en" target="_blank"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Plan</em> </p> <p>You must be a <em>group administrator</em> of the group or a <em>Workfront administrator</em>. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p>The project must be associated with the group or any of its subgroups. </p> <p>For information about assigning a group to a project, see <a href="../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/understand-project-overview-area.md" class="MCXref xref">Manage information in the project Overview area</a>.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>Also, you must have permissions to edit the project, either because you created it or it was shared with you.</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </li> 
    </ul> <p>Note: When you create a project from a group’s page, the system assigns the project to that group. This is different from creating a project in other <em>Workfront</em> areas, where the system assigns the project to the Home Group of the user who creates it (the Project Owner).</p> </td> 
  </tr>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.
