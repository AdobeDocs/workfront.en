# View and manage a group's recently restored items

When you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with its recently restored projects, tasks, issues, documents, and templates in the following ways:

* View, filter, and group a list of recently restored items
* Export a list of recently restored items

If there are any groups above your group, their administrators can also do these things for your group. The same is true for `Workfront administrators` (for any group).

For more information about restored items, see [Restore deleted items](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/manage-deleted-items/restore-deleted-items.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Plan</span> </p> <p>You must be a <span>group administrator</span> of the group or a <span>Workfront administrator</span>. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>The restored items must be associated with the group or any of its subgroups. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.
