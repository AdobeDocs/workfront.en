# Create and modify a group’s projects

As a `group administrator`, when you are viewing a group that you manage in the Groups area, you can view and work with its projects.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for `Workfront administrators` (for any group).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans" target="_blank"><span>Workfront</span> plan</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><a href="https://one.workfront.com/s/document-item?bundleId=the-new-workfront-experience&amp;topicId=Content%2FAdministration_and_Setup%2FAdd_users%2FAccess_levels_and_object_permissions%2Fwf-licenses.html&amp;_LANG=en" target="_blank"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license</a>*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Plan</span> </p> <p>You must be a <span>group administrator</span> of the group or a <span>Workfront administrator</span>. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>The project must be associated with the group or any of its subgroups.</p> <p>Also, you must have permissions to view the project, either because you created it or it was shared with you.</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.
