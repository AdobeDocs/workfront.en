# Assign a user as a `group administrator`

As a `group administrator` of a group, you can assign other users as `group administrators` for that group. `Adobe Workfront administrators` can also do this.

For more information about `group administrators` and what they can do, see [Group administrators](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md) and [Actions allowed for different types of administrators](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-actions-allowed-different-types-admins.md).

For general information about groups, see [Groups overview](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/groups-overview/groups.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr>

  </tr>
