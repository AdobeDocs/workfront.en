# View the number of licenses allocated and used in a group in `the new Adobe Workfront experience`

As an `Adobe Workfront administrator`, you can view counts of the individual types of licenses currently used in your group and its subgroups. This is useful when you need to assess whether to redistribute licenses.

If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for `Workfront administrators` (for any group).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>A user’s license is counted in a particular group only if the group is the user’s Home Group.

## Access requirements

   <p>If the group you are looking at is a subgroup, you can view only the numbers of licenses being used, not the maximum number of licenses allocated for the group. This is because <span>Workfront administrators</span> do not define a maximum license count for a subgroup.</p>
