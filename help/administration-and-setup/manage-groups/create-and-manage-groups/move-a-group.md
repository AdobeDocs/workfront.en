## Move a group

To move a group, you edit the destination parent group.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the statuses of the moved group are locked, it inherits the statuses of its new parent group.
>
>If the statuses of the moved group are unlocked, it does not inherit the statuses of its new parent group, nor does the new parent group take on its statuses.
>
>For more information about group statuses, see [Create or edit a status](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-or-edit-a-status.md) and [Create or edit a group status](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/manage-group-statuses/create-or-edit-a-group-status.md).
