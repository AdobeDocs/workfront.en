# Delete a group {#delete-a-group}

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.


You can delete a group that you manage. If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for *`Workfront administrators`* (for any group).


For information about deleting a subgroup, see [Manage a group](manage-a-group.md).
