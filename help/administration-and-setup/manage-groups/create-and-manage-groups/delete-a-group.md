# Delete a group

You can delete a group that you manage. If there are any groups above the group you manage, their administrators can also do this for your group. The same is true for `Workfront administrators` (for any group).

For information about deleting a subgroup, see [Manage a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/manage-a-group.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Plan</span> </p> <p>You must be a <span>group administrator</span> of the group or a <span>Workfront administrator</span>. For more information, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/group-roles/group-administrators.md" class="MCXref xref">Group administrators</a> and <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-a-user-full-administrative-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant a user full administrative access</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If you need to find out what plan or license type you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.
