<!--
Inactive groups Consider the following about a group that you deactivate by disabling the Is Active option. For more about this option, see View and manage a group’s details in this article. If you copy an inactive group, the new group is also inactive. Deactivating a group also deactivates all subgroups below it. If you want to re-activate one of the subgroups, you must first move from underneath the inactive parent group, then select the Is Active option on its Details page. For instructions on moving a group, see Move a group. For instructions on selecting its Is Active option, see View and manage a group’s detailsin this article. Deactivating a group does not change the following: Any associations the group has to certain objects. The associated objects continue to function as they did before, without any changes. For example, if a project is associated with a group you deactivate, the project continues to use the group's preferences and statuses without any changes. Your ability to create a new object, such as an approval, team, or company, from within the group's page in setup. By default, the new object is associated with the inactive group. Your ability, as an administrator, to find the group in filters and reporting. You can also find it in group type-ahead fields where you might want to manage the group's settings in the Setup area. This includes the Preferences, Event Notifications, and System Licenses areas. For example, as shown below, if you go to Setup > Project Preference > Projects and clear the type-ahead field above the options there, you can still find an inactive group and configure its project preferences.
