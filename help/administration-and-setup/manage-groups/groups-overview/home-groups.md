# Home Groups overview {#home-groups-overview}

A Home Group is assigned in the user's profile. All users are required to have a Home Group. A user can belong to more than one group, but they can have only one Home Group. For more information about Groups, see [Groups overview](groups.md).


Although any existing group in the system can be assigned as a user's Home Group, we recommend creating and assigning new groups that represent larger organizational units.


When establishing Home Groups, consider how your organization divides your *`Adobe Workfront`* users. Here are a few suggestions to determine what type of groups should be used as a Home Group:



* Groups that represent departments, such as IT or Marketing
* Groups governed by different budgets
* Groups located in different areas or regions
* Groups made up of multiple teams that belong to the same cost center

## Layout Template management {#layout-template-management}

When you assign a Layout Template to a group, all users that have the group assigned as their Home Group can see the settings specified in the Layout Template.


If a Layout Template is assigned to a Home Group, it is only visible to users assigned&nbsp;to that Home Group.


For more information, see [Create and manage layout templates](create-and-manage-layout-templates.md) in [Create and manage layout templates](create-and-manage-layout-templates.md).


## License management {#license-management}

Each user can be assigned to only one Home Group, which makes it easier to manage license counts.


*`Workfront administrators`* have the option to set maximum license counts for the Home Groups.


Setting a max license count allows *`Workfront administrators`* to prevent a business unit from using *`Workfront`* licenses purchased for other business units.


For more information, see [Manage available licenses in your system](manage-available-licenses-in-your-system.md).
