# Removal of various single sign-on options {#removal-of-various-single-sign-on-options}

*`Adobe Workfront`* is removing support for various single sign-on (SSO) options. The end result will be a consistent and more secure sign-in experience across all *`Workfront`* products and services.


The following SSO options are now supported only in a limited capacity; they will be removed from the product in 2020:



*  LDAP


  For more information about using LDAP with *`Workfront`*, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with LDAP](configure-workfront-ldap.md).

*  Active Directory


  For more information about using Active Directory with *`Workfront`*, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with Active Directory](configure-workfront-ad.md).

*  SAML 1.1


  For more information about using SAML 1.1 with *`Workfront`*, see [Configure Adobe Workfront with SAML 1.1](configure-workfront-saml-1.1.md).
