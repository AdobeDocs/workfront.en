# Configure system security preferences

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The procedure described on this page applies only to organizations that are not yet onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console.
>
>If your organization has been onboarded to the Adobe Admin Console, see [Platform-based administration differences (Adobe Workfront/Adobe Business Platform)](../../../administration-and-setup/get-started-wf-administration/actions-in-admin-console.md).

As an *Adobe Workfront administrator*, you can configure security preferences for your *Workfront* system:

* Access to *Workfront* from mobile apps and other integrated applications
* Rules for embedding *Workfront* in an iframe

Changes that you make in the system preferences impact all users in your system, and their experience in *Workfront*.

We recommend that you configure your system security preferences during the *Workfront* implementation and only occasionally revisit them after that.

## Access requirements

You must have the following to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td>
