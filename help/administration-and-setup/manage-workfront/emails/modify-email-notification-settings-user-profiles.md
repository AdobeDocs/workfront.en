# Modify email notification settings in users’ profiles

If you are an Adobe Workfront administrator or you have a Planner access level allowing you to edit other users' settings, you can configure the notification settings for multiple users at one time. This includes specifying whether users receive notifications as events happen, or in one daily digest email, as described in [Adobe Workfront notifications](../../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/wf-notifications.md). For information about the access level needed to edit users, see [Grant access to users](../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-other-users.md).

When you configure notification settings in bulk, you can change only the settings that the selected users have in common.

You can also configure email notifications for one user at a time. For more information, see [Activate or deactivate your own event notifications](../../../workfront-basics/using-notifications/activate-or-deactivate-your-own-event-notifications.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Plan </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan or license type you have, contact your Workfront administrator.
