## Configure pop-up messages for *proofs*

You can configure pop-up messages on *proofs* to communicate general information to all reviewers in your organization.

You can configure messages to appear in the following situations:

* `On load message`: Displays when the *proof* first opens. Useful for explaining to users how to review a *proof* or to provide a disclaimer or other legal text.

* `On decision message`: Displays when a user selects a decision on a *proof*. Useful for giving your users checklists for things such as brand or regulatory compliance. For information about decisions, see [Make a decision on a proof in the proofing viewer](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/make-a-decision-on-a-proof/make-decisions-on-proof.md).

* `Confirm button text`: The label that displays on the button in the On load pop-up message explained above.

To create pop-up messages for *proofs*:

1. Click `Edit` to the right of the message you want to customize.
1. Specify a message and include the appropriate formatting, then click `Save`.
1. (Optional) If you customized the On load message and you want to also customize the confirmation button label, click  `Edit` to the right of  `Confirm button text`, specify a label, then click  `Save`.&nbsp;

## Configure *proof* defaults

You can define global *proof* default settings that apply to all *proof*s created by users in your organization's account.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The visibility of these settings in your account depends on your plan level; requirements for each setting are specified below.

To modify the default settings for *proof*s:

  </ul> </li> 
</ol>

### Deadline (+business days)

*Workfront Proof* applies this deadline to all new *proofs* in your account that do not have an Automated Workflow.

### Copy owner from original *proof*

This setting is useful if you have different people creating different versions or copies of *proofs*. By default, it is set to Enabled, which means that the owner of the first version a *proof* is also the owner of all consecutive versions of the *proof*, regardless of who creates these versions.

If you disable this setting, the person who creates any new version of a *proof* becomes the owner of that version. This means that different versions of the same *proof* can have different owners.

This setting applies both to creating new *proofs* and copying *proofs*.

### Electronic signatures

<!--
<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px 6px; color: #555555; background-color: #eeeeee; border: #dddddd 2px solid;" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see <a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans">Workfront Plans.</a></p>
-->

A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [Workfront Plans.](https://www.workfront.com/plans)

This setting makes electronic signatures mandatory on all *proofs* created in your organization's account. When decision makers on the *proof* submit their decision, *Workfront Proof* prompts them to confirm the decision by entering their login credentials. This means that your users cannot share *proofs* with Guest reviewers who don't have *Workfront Proof* logins.

The electronic signatures message displays when *Workfront Proof* prompts reviewers to electronically sign their decision on a *proof*.

To learn more about&nbsp;electronic signatures, see [Understanding electronic signatures in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/managing-security/electronic-sigs-in-wp.md).

### Proof counter

<!--
<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px 6px; color: #555555; background-color: #eeeeee; border: #dddddd 2px solid;" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see <a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans">Workfront Plans.</a></p>
-->

A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [Workfront Plans.](https://www.workfront.com/plans)

The Proof counter assigns a number to the *proofs* created in your account. It is unique to your account.

When a user creates new versions of a *proof*, the *proof* counter assigns the same number to every version.

You can specify the number from which the *proof* counter should count every time a user creates a *proof*.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Once you enable the counter and start creating *proofs*, you cannot change the start number.

### Make folder mandatory

This setting forces users to add their new *proofs* to folders. A *proof* creator can save a *proof* only after selecting the folder where they want to store it. This is helpful in keeping your *proofs* organized.

### Disable *proof* email notifications

This setting is most commonly used by companies who developed an integration with their own systems using our Public API. If enabled, your account does not send any emails, including the New *proof* emails and Email alerts. You can still see the&nbsp;Message and Share *proof* links options in the account, but they do not&nbsp;trigger any emails.

### Right-to-left text support in comments

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This feature is no longer supported in the viewer and will be removed in the near future.

If your reviewers use languages with right-to-left text direction&nbsp;in their comments, you can enable this setting so that they are able change the text direction of a comment.&nbsp;

### Login required

<!--
<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px 6px; color: #555555; background-color: #eeeeee; border: #dddddd 2px solid;" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see <a href="https://www.workfront.com/plans">Workfront Plans.</a></p>
-->

A Select or Premium Plan is required to use this feature. For more information about the various plans available, see [Workfront Plans.](https://www.workfront.com/plans)

Login required enhances the security of the *proofs* created in your account.&nbsp;If&nbsp;it&nbsp;is enabled, reviewers are required to log in using their email and password before they are allowed to view *proofs* created in your organization's account. This means that your users cannot share the *proof* with Guest reviewers.

### Comment deletion

If you don't want your reviewers to be able to delete their own comments, you can disable this option in your account.

### *Web Proofing Viewer*

The *Web Proofing Viewer* is available to use for video and static *proofs*.&nbsp;

You can choose whether the users in your organization use the *Web Proofing Viewer* or one of the other two available viewers. See [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md) for more information.

To enable the *Web Proofing Viewer* for users in your system, select from the following options:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col>

   <td>When this option is selected, users cannot use&nbsp;the Web Proofing viewer.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

### Desktop Proofing Viewer

The *Desktop Proofing Viewer* is the recommended viewer for reviewing *proofs* containing interactive web content. It can also *proof* static and video content.

The settings below let you specify whether your users open interactive content in the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* or the *Web Proofing Viewer*:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Enabled for all interactive <em>proof</em>s</td> 
   <td>The <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em> opens every time a user launches an interactive <em>proof</em>. Users can <em>proof</em> interactive content bundled in a ZIP file, secure (https) and non-secure (http) websites, and websites with iFrame protection.</td>

   <td>With this configuration, designed for organizations that can't use the standalone <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em>, the <em>Web Proofing Viewer</em> launches when users open interactive <em>proofs</em> created from a bundled ZIP file; the Desktop Proofing viewer launches when users open an interactive <em>proof</em> created from a URL.<p>For information about these two types of interactive <em>proofs</em>, see the section <a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/interactive-content-proofs.md#about" class="MCXref xref">About creating proofs for interactive content</a> in the article <a href="../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/interactive-content-proofs.md" class="MCXref xref">Interactive content proofs overview</a>.</p><p>Note: Internet Explorer is not supported for <em>proofing</em> interactive content in the <em>Web Proofing Viewer</em>.</p></td> 
  </tr>

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Configure sharing defaults
