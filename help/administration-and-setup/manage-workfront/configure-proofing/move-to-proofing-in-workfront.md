# Standalone *`Workfront Proof`* to Integrated *`Proofing`* in *`Workfront`* overview {#standalone-workfront-proof-to-integrated-proofing-in-workfront-overview}

If your organization changes from the standalone version of *`Workfront Proof`* to the *`Workfront`* Pro plan, in which *`Workfront Proof`* Premium is integrated with *`Workfront`*, the following functionality is not available: 



*  Ability to access *`Workfront Proof`* (limited to *`Workfront`* administrators). For more information, see [Access Workfront Proof from Adobe Workfront](access-wf-proof-in-workfront.md).


  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >In *`Workfront Proof`*, the New *`proof`* button is disabled; *`proofs`* can be created only *`Workfront`*.



*  Ability to copy a version of a *`proof`*. For more information, see&nbsp; [Copying Proofs in Workfront Proof](copy-proofs.md).  

*  Ability to copy the settings of an existing *`proof`*. For more information, see [Copying Existing Proof Settings for a New Proof](copy-proofs.md#copy-with-new-file)&nbsp;in [Copying Proofs in Workfront Proof](copy-proofs.md).  

*  Ability to change the previous version of a *`proof`*. For more information, see [Linking Proof Versions](manage-proof-versions.md#linking-and-unlinking-proof-versions) in [Managing Proof Versions in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-versions.md).  

*  Ability to remove link to previous version of a *`proof`*. For more information, see [Unlinking Proof Versions](manage-proof-versions.md#unlinkingproofversions) in [Managing Proof Versions in Workfront Proof](manage-proof-versions.md).  

*  Ability to add tags to *`proofs`*. For more information, see [Create and Manage Tags in Workfront Proof](create-and-manage-tags.md).  

*  Ability of administrator to assign custom *`proof`* permission profiles. For more information, see&nbsp; [Configure custom profiles in Workfront Proof](configure-custom-profiles.md).  

*  Ability of administrator to enable and disable *`proofing`* functionality for a single user.  



  For more information, see [Enable and disable proofing for a user (legacy plans only)](configure-a-users-proofing-access.md#enabling-and-disabling-proofing-for-a-user) in the article [Configure a user's proofing access](configure-a-users-proofing-access.md).

* This ability is no longer necessary because *`proofing`* functionality is now available for all users with a worker license or higher. Reviewers and guests can access and work on *`proofs`*, but cannot generate *`proofs`*.

*  Ability for Reviewers and Requesters to generate *`proofs`*. Only Workers, Planners, and System Administrators can generate *`proofs`* in integrated *`proofing`*. For information about changing a user's access level in *`Workfront`*, see [Create or modify custom access levels](create-modify-access-levels.md).
* Ability of users to access the standalone version of *`Workfront Proof`* (this is limited to *`Workfront administrators`*).
