# Edit list controls: filters, views, and groupings

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you use the List Controls area to determine which filters, views, and groupings you want available in your Workfront instance and listed in all layout templates in the system.

In a layout template, you can then enable the filters, views, and groupings that you want available for the users who are assigned to that layout template. Users can see them as options in their drop-down menus above their lists of objects and reports.

For more information, see [Reporting elements: filters, views, and groupings](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/reporting-elements/reporting-elements-filters-views-groupings.md).

## Remove filters, views, and groupings

You can remove filters, views, and groupings, including most of the default ones, from your Workfront instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>At least one filter, one view, and one grouping must remain in your Workfront instance at all times. Without at least one, your lists and reports do not display. In order to assure that a Workfront administrator does not inadvertently delete all of the filters, views, or groupings, the following defaults canâ€™t be removed: Standard view, All filter, and Nothing grouping.
