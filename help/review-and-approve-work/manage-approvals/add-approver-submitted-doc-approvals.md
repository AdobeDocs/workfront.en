You can add additional approvers to a document approval directly from the Home area.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td>

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td>

  </tr> 
  <tr>

  </tr> 
  <tr>

 </tbody>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Add additional approvers to submitted document approvals

1. In the `Work List` area, Go to the `Approvals I've Submitted` grouping.

1. Select a `Document` approval.  

1. Click `Manage Approvals`&nbsp;in the upper-right corner of the right panel.
1. In the `Have someone approve this document` box, type the name of the approver.

   If your `Adobe Workfront administrator` has enabled the capability to collaborate with people who don't use `Workfront`, as described in [Configure system security preferences](../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/security/configure-security-preferences.md), you can type their email addresses to include them.

1. Click `Save`.
