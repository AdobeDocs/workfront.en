## Add, edit, or delete a deadline for a stage

You must be the proof owner or creator to set deadlines.

1. To save your change, click outside the deadline box.
1. In the prompt that appears, specify whether you want to send an email alert to reviewers.&nbsp;

## Set individual reviewer deadlines

To create a stage and add a deadline for an individual reviewer:

1. Add information for the stage,&nbsp;particularly the reviewer's name and the deadline you want for the reviewer.
1. Repeat the two previous steps as needed to add any other reviewers who need their own deadline.

## Remove individual reviewer deadlines

You can remove a deadline for the stage the reviewer is on.

1. Click `Clear` on the calendar that appears.
1. To save your change, click outside the deadline box.
