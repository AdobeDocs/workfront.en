# Send email messages to reviewers on a `proof`

During the review and approval process, you can send a message to one or all of the reviewers on a `proof`. Messages are an easy way to remind reviewers to complete their review of a `proof` or to provide other information related to the `proof`.

You can choose between sending a generic reminder email or sending a customized message to one or all of the users associated with a given stage.
