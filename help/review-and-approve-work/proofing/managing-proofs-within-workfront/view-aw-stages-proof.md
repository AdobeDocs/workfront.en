You can conveniently track the progress of a *proof* configured with an Automated Worklow. You can view, modify, add, start, and lock the work already done on stages on the *proof*.

For information about adding stages and users to a proof with an Automated Workflow, see [Add stages and users to an Automated Workflow on a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/add-stages-users-to-automated-workflow-proof.md).
