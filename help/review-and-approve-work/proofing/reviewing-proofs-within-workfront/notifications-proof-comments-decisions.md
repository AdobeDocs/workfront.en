# Notifications for `proof` comments and decisions {#notifications-for-proof-comments-and-decisions}

You can receive email notifications about comments and decisions made on proofs you work on in one of the following ways: 



*  Receive an email when someone adds a comment, replies to a comment you have added, or makes a decision. 
*  Receive an email when someone replies to a comment you have added. 
* Receive an email when someone makes a decision.
* Receive an email when someone makes the final decision.
*  Receive an hourly summary email when someone replies to a comment you have added or makes a decision during the previous hour. 
*  Receive a daily summary email when someone replies to a comment you have added or makes a decision during the day. 
* Receive no emails about comments or decisions.


The settings that determine how you receive email alerts about proof comments and decisions are available in the following places in Workfront:
