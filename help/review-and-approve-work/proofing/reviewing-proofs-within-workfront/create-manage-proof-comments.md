# Create and manage *proof* comments

Comments enable you&nbsp;to provide feedback on work and collaborate with other users in the *proofing viewer*. When tagging users in comments on a proof, the users you are able to tag might differ depending on various factors, such as individual user permissions and your membership in the organization:

* If you are the proof creator, owner, or have specific permissions enabled, you can tag users outside of the proof workflow and share the proof with them.
* If you were added to the proof as an outside user and you are a member of another environment with a different proof account, you can tag only those users from your original environment. For more information, see [Proofing collaboration limitations with people outside of your organization](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/collaboration-with-members-outside-of-your-organization.md)

## Edit a comment

You can edit any comment you make on a *proof*. Additionally, the following users&nbsp;can edit comments made by other users:

* The *proof* Owner
* The *proof* Creator
* Users with Supervisor profile permissions
* Users with a proof role of Author or Moderator

Comments cannot be edited after a reply is added to the comment. This restriction maintains the integrity of the comment thread.

When you edit a comment, the time the comment was made is not affected.

To edit a comment:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Open the <em>proof</em> containing the comment that you want to edit.</li>

 <li value="4"> <p>Make any changes in the comment, then click <span class="bold">Post</span>.</p> 
  <div> 
   <p>The label "Edited" appears on the comment. When a reviewer mouses over this, your name and the date and time of the changes appear. If you edit the comment more than once, this information appears only for the most recent change.</p> 
   <p> <img src="assets/comments-edited-label-350x211.png" alt="Comments-Edited_label.png" style="width: 350;height: 211;"> </p>

## Resolve a comment

   <!--
   <p class="preview" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver,QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode">A "Thread resolved" label also appears above the <span class="bold">Updates</span> comment in the Summary. For information about the Summary, see <a href="../../../documents/managing-documents/summary-for-documents.md" class="MCXref xref">Summary for documents overview</a>.</p>
   -->

   A "Thread resolved" label also appears above the `Updates` comment in the Summary. For information about the Summary, see [Summary for documents overview](../../../documents/managing-documents/summary-for-documents.md).

   <!--
   <p class="preview" data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Draft mode,QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">Also, the "Thread resolved" label above the <span class="bold">Updates</span> comment in the Summary is removed. For information about the Summary, see <a href="../../../documents/managing-documents/summary-for-documents.md" class="MCXref xref">Summary for documents overview</a>.</p>
   -->

   Also, the "Thread resolved" label above the `Updates` comment in the Summary is removed. For information about the Summary, see [Summary for documents overview](../../../documents/managing-documents/summary-for-documents.md).

## About applying an action to a comment

You can use actions to keep track of what needs to happen on each comment thread on a *proof*. An action is simply a word or phrase you select and add to a comment to provide information about what has been done or what still needs to be done in response to the comment.

Your *Workfront administrator* enables and configures your organization's actions to meet the needs of *proof* reviewers in your organization.

For example, your reviewers may need actions such as "To Do," "Done," and "In Progress":

![Actions_on_coments.png](assets/actions-on-coments-350x171.png)

Other typical actions include Make Changes, Disregard, and Clarification Needed.

For more information, see [Use actions on proof comments](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/use-actions-on-comments-in-viewer.md).

## Mark all comments as read

As a reviewer of a *proof*, you can quickly mark all comments as Read.

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Open the <em>proof</em> containing the comments you want to mark as Read.</li> 
 <li value="2">(Conditional) If the comments area is not open, click&nbsp;<span class="bold">View comments</span>&nbsp;in the upper-right corner.<br></li> 
 <li value="3">Above the comment list, click the <span class="bold">More</span> (three dots) icon, then click <span class="bold">Mark all as read</span>.</li> 
 <p> <img src="assets/mceclip8-350x173.png" style="width: 350;height: 173;"> </p>

## Delete a comment or reply

You can delete a comment or a reply to a comment as long as no one has already replied to it.

It is usually better to resolve a&nbsp;comment rather than delete it. For more informaton, see&nbsp; [Resolve a comment](#resolving-a-comment) in this article.

Additionally, the following users can delete comments or replies made by other users:

* The *proof* Moderator
* Users with Supervisor profile permissions

After a comment is deleted, the system logs an&nbsp;entry in the *proof* activity section, showing that the comment was deleted.

To delete a comment or reply:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Open the <em>proof</em> containing the comment or reply that you want to delete.</li> 
 <li value="2">(Conditional) If the comments area is not open, click&nbsp;<span class="bold">View comments</span>&nbsp;in the upper-right corner.</li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Select the comment or reply, then click the <span class="bold">More</span> (three dots) icon.<br></p> <p> <img src="assets/phq-viewer-comment-edit.png" alt="phq_viewer_comment_edit.png"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="4">Click <span class="bold">Delete</span> ><span class="bold"> Yes, delete it</span>.</li> 
</ol>

## Receive email notifications about comments

The email notifications you receive about comment activity are determined by the option you select in the `Email alerts`&nbsp;menu on the *proof*.&nbsp; For more information, see in [Manage notifications for proof comments and decisions](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/manage-notifications-for-proof-comments.md).
