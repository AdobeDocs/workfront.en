# Review non-interactive content in the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` {#review-non-interactive-content-in-the-desktop-proofing-viewer}

Though the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` is designed for reviewing interactive content, you can also use it to review static and video content. Your `Workfront administrator` can configure the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` to open every time you launch a static or video `proof`. 


Once you open a non-interactive proof into the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`, it works the same way as the `Web Proofing Viewer`. If you need information on this functionality, see the following:



* [Review a static proof](review-a-static-proof.md) 
* [Review a video proof](review-a-video-proof-in-proofing-viewer.md)
