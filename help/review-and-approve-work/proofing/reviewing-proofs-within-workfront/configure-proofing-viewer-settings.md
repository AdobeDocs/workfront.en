## Configure *`proofing viewer`* settings {#configure-proofing-viewer-settings-1}

To configure *`proofing viewer`* settings:



1. Open the *`Web Proofing Viewer`* or the *`Desktop Proofing Viewer`* in one of the following ways: 
    
    
    * If you *`proof`* within *`Adobe Workfront`*, go to a document list containing a *`proof`* you want to view, hover over the document, then click  `Open *`proof`*`.
    
    * If you use *`Workfront Proof`*, click the `Go to Proof` icon for the *`proof`* in the Dashboard or a Views list. ![](assets/go-to-proof-blue-icon.png)  
    
    
    

1.  If the left toolbar is not showing, click the  `Menu` icon, located in the upper-left corner of the *`Web Proofing Viewer`*.


   ![](assets/menu-icon-in-proofing-viewer-350x228.png)



1.  In the left toolbar, click the `Settings` icon ![](assets/settings-icon-in-pv.png).   

1.   Configure any of the following `Settings` that display.


   The settings available might vary depending on the type of *`proof`* you have open.

    
    
    *  `Show markups` (always available in the *`Web Proofing Viewer`* and the *`Desktop Proofing Viewer`*): These are the comment marks that reviewers add to *`proofs`* when they use the markup tools. If you disable them, you can still see them when you click a comment in the comment list.
    
    
      This setting affects all *`proofs`* you open.
    
    *  `Show pins` (always available in the *`Web Proofing Viewer`* and the *`Desktop Proofing Viewer`*): These are the numbered pins that reviewers add to *`proofs`* when they use the markup tools. They indicate where and in what order the reviewer added comments. If you disable them, you can still see them when you click a comment in the comment list.
    
    
      This setting affects all *`proofs`* you open.
    
    *  `Use expanded markup tools` (always available in the *`Web Proofing Viewer`* and the *`Desktop Proofing Viewer`*): By default, the markup tool options display across the top of the *`proofing`* viewer.&nbsp;You can configure them to display in a vertical menu that opens only when you click it.
    
    
      This setting is in effect for all *`proofs`* you open.
    
    *  `Send me email notifications about` (always available in the *`Web Proofing Viewer`* and the *`Desktop Proofing Viewer`*): Click one of the options below. This setting affects only the *`proof`* you have open. For more information, see [Notifications for proof comments and decisions overview](notifications-proof-comments-decisions.md).
