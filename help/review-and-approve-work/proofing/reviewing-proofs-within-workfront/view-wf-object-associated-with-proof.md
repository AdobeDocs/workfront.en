# View the Adobe Workfront object associated with a proof

When you review a proof that is associated with a Adobe Workfront object (usually a project, task, or issue), you can access the associated Workfront object to view updates and related documents and better understand the wider context of the work you need to do.

>[!NOTE]

>This functionality is not available if you are using an external collaborator license to access the proof.
