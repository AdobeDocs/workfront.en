# Compare *proofs*

You can use the *proofing viewer* to compare two different *proofs* or two versions of the same *proof*.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Pro or Higher</p> <p>or</p> <p>Legacy plan: Select or Premium</p> <p>For more information about proofing access with the different plans, see <a href="../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md" class="MCXref xref">Access to proofing functionality in Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: <em>Review</em></p> <p>Legacy plan: <em>Review</em></p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Proof Permission Profile</em> </td> 
   <td>Manager or higher</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td>

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or *Proof Permission Profile* you have, contact your *Workfront* or *Workfront Proof administrator*.

## Compare two different *proofs*

You can compare two *proofs* within any single document list, such as within the Documents tab in a project, task, issue, portfolio, or within the main Documents area .&nbsp;

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to the document list that contains the two proofed documents you want to compare.</li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Select the first document that you want to compare, then press and hold the Command key (on Mac) or the Ctrl key (on Windows) and select the second document that you want to compare.</p> <note type="note">
   A 
   <em>proof</em> must already be generated for each document that you select for comparison.
  </note> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Compare Proofs</span>.</p> <draft-comment>
