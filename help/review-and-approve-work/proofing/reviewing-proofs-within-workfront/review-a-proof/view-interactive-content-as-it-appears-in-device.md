# Change interactive `proof` resolution in the `proofing viewer`

You can preview how an interactive `proof` looks on various devices, allowing you to see how content displays and responds based on different resolutions.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Pro or Higher</p> <p>or</p> <p>Legacy plan: Select or Premium</p> <p>For more information about proofing access with the different plans, see <a href="../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md" class="MCXref xref">Access to proofing functionality in Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: <span>Work</span> or <span>Plan</span></p> <p>Legacy plan: Any (You must have proofing enabled for the user)</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Proof Permission Profile</span> </td> 
   <td>Manager or higher</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or `Proof Permission Profile` you have, contact your `Workfront` or `Workfront Proof administrator`.

## Device and Resolution Views in `Desktop Proofing Viewer` vs. `Web Proofing Viewer`

Your `Adobe Workfront administrator` has configured your system so that you review interactive content either in the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` or, as bundled content in a ZIP file, in the `Web Proofing Viewer`:

* In the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`, you can view how content appears and responds both in various resolutions and on various devices. When a reviewer specifies a certain device, the content appears as it would on that device, with the user interface specifications for the device. For example, a red button on one brand of smart phone may be blue on a different brand.

<ul> 
 <li> <p>In the <span>Web Proofing Viewer</span>, you can view interactive content as it appears in the resolutions for the various devices. But the <span>Web Proofing Viewer</span> does not emulate the content using interface specifications on these devices, such as button color.</p> <note type="note">
   Your 
   <span>Workfront administrator</span> can configure custom devices for users in your organization, as described in Configuring Custom Devices for Interactive Proofs in the article 
   <a href="../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-a-users-proofing-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Configure a user's proofing access</a>.
  </note> </li> 
</ul>

## View a `proof` with a preset device or resolution setting

<ol>

 <li value="2">Hover over the document, then click&nbsp;<span class="bold">Open proof</span>.</li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Click <span class="bold">Responsive</span> at the center-bottom of the <span>proofing viewer</span>.<br></p> <p> <img src="assets/resolution-option-in-dpv-350x64.png" alt="Resolution_option_in_DPV.png" style="width: 350;height: 64;"> <br> </p> </li> 
 <li value="4"> <p>In the <span>Desktop Proofing Viewer</span>, in the list of devices and resolutions that appears, click the one you want.</p> <p>Or</p> <p>In the <span>Web Proofing Viewer</span>, in the list of resolutions that appears, click the one you want.</p> <p>If you need information about how these two viewers differ, see <a href="../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md" class="MCXref xref">Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview</a>.</p> <p>The interactive <span>proof</span> renders in the resolution you select.</p> </li> 
</ol>

## View a `proof` with a custom resolution setting

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Go to the document list that contains the <span>proof</span> you want to open.</p> </li> 
 <li value="2">Hover over the document, then click&nbsp;<span class="bold">Open proof</span>.</li> 
 <li value="3">Click <span class="bold">Responsive</span> at the center-bottom of the Proofing Viewer.</li>
