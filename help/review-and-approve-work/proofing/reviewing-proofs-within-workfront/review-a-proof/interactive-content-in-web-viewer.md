# Set up interactive content `proofing` in `Web Proofing Viewer`

We recommend that you review all interactive content using the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`. However, if your organization's policies prevent this, your `Workfront administrator` can configure your system to use the `Web Proofing Viewer` for interactive `proofing`. For comparative information about these two viewers, see [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md).

After your `Workfront administrator` configures your system for interactive `proofing` in the `Web Proofing Viewer`, you need to download an extension in order to add comments and markups to interactive `proofs`:

## Limitations

The `Web Proofing Viewer` has the following limitations:

* Does not support URL `proofs` (supports only ZIP archive files).
* Does not support Safari and Internet Explorer.
* Does not emulate content using interface specifications on mobile devices, such as button color, though it does let you view interactive content as it appears in the resolutions for the various devices.

## Set up interactive content `proofing` in `Web Proofing Viewer`

1. Open a `proof` created from a ZIP file containing interactive content.

   For more information, see [About preparing interactive content in a ZIP file for proofing](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/interactive-content-proofs.md#howtoprepareaninteractiveziparchive) in [Interactive content proofs overview](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/interactive-content-proofs.md).

   See also [Create a proof for interactive content in a ZIP file](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof-interactive-content-.md).

1. Click `Add comment`.

   A message prompts you to download the browser extension for interactive content.

1. Click `Add to browser` to go to the extension download page in your browser's store, then download the extension.
1. In the `Web Proofing Viewer`, click `Reload the `proof``.

With the extension installed on your browser, the `proofing viewer` takes a static screenshot of your content every time you click `Add comment`. This screenshot is where you can add comments with markups.
