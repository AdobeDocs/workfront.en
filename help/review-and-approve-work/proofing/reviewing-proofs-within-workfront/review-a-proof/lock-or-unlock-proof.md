# Lock or unlock a proof

You can manually lock and unlock a proof any time in the review process.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Pro or Higher</p> <p>or</p> <p>Legacy plan: Premium</p> <p>For more information about proofing access with the different plans, see <a href="../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md" class="MCXref xref">Access to proofing functionality in Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Work or Plan</p> <p>Legacy plan: Any (You must have proofing enabled for the user)</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Proof role</td> 
   <td>Owner, Author, Moderator</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Proof Permission Profile </td> 
   <td>Supervisor or Administrator</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or Proof Permission Profile you have, contact your Workfront or Workfront Proof administrator.

## Lock a proof

You can manually lock a proof to prevent or allow commenting by reviewers. This is different from locking a proof stage.

To lock a proof:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to the document list that contains the proof you want to open.</li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Hover over the document, then click the <span class="bold">Open proof</span> link that appears. </p> <p>Or</p> If you want to open a proof for an earlier version of the document, click the More icon for that version in the Summary, then click Open proof. For information about the Summary, see Summary for documents overview. </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>In the In the left panel, click the <span class="bold">Lock</span> icon <img src="assets/unlock-proof-icon.png">.</p> <p> <img src="assets/lock-proof-350x277.png" style="width: 350;height: 277;"> </p> </li> 
</ol>

## Unlock a proof

Unlocking a proof is useful when you need reviewers to add comments to a previous version of a proof. (A previous version is always locked until the proof owner manually unlocks it.) When the reviewers have finished adding comments to the previous version, you can lock it again. For information about viewing a previous version of a proof, see [View previous proof versions in the Web Proofing Viewer](../../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/view-previous-proof-versions.md).

To unlock a proof:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Hover over the document, then click the <span class="bold">Open proof</span> link that appears. </p> <p>Or</p> If you want to open a proof for an earlier version of the document, click the More icon for that version in the Summary, then click Open proof. For information about the Summary, see Summary for documents overview. </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>In the left panel, click the <span class="bold">Unlock</span> icon <img src="assets/unlock-proof-icon.png">, then click <span class="bold">Yes, unlock</span>. </p> <p> <img src="assets/copy-of-unlock-proof-350x279.png" style="width: 350;height: 279;"> </p> </li> 
</ol>
