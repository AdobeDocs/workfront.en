# Review a static `proof`

You can review a `proof` that has been shared with you or a `proof` you have created.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Current plan: Pro or Higher</p> <p>or</p> <p>Legacy plan: Select or Premium</p> <p>For more information about proofing access with the different plans, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/access-to-proofing-functionality.md" class="MCXref xref">Access to proofing functionality in Workfront</a>.</p> </td>

  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or `Proof Permission Profile` you have, contact your `Workfront` or `Workfront Proof administrator`.

## Open and work with a proof

1. Go to the document list that contains the `proof` you want to open.
1. Hover over the document, then click  `Open proof`.

   You can `proof` static content in the `Web Proofing Viewer` or the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`. The viewer that opens depends on how your `Adobe Workfront administrator` has configured your organization's `proofing viewer`s.

1. Do any of the following:

* Comment on the `proof`, as explained in [Create and manage proof comments](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/create-manage-proof-comments.md).

* Use `proofing viewer` functionality described in the remaining sections below.

For information about creating a `proof`, see [Generate a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof.md).

For general information that relates to reviewing `proofs`, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

If you cannot use a Proofing Viewer as described in this section, consult your `Workfront administrator`.

## Change the view of your `proof`

You can view a static `proof` that contains multiple pages in a single view, in a continues view, or in a magazine view.

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Locate the various view options in the upper-left section of the <span>proofing viewer</span>.<br><img src="assets/changing-the-view-350x213.png" alt="changing_the_view.png" style="width: 350;height: 213;"></li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click any of the following options:</p> 
  <table cellspacing="0"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Single view</td> 
     <td>Displays only a single page at a time. Click the thumbnail of the page you want to view, or press the Left and Right arrow keys to navigate between pages.<br><img src="assets/proof-static-view-single.png" alt="proof_static_view_single.png"></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Continuous view</td> 
     <td>Displays all pages in a single, stacked view.&nbsp;Click the thumbnail of the page you want to view, or press the Left and Right arrow keys to scroll up or down all pages in a continuous view.<br><img src="assets/proof-static-view-continuous.png" alt="proof_static_view_continuous.png"></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Magazine view</td> 
     <td>Displays all pages in a single, magazine view (side-by-side and stacked).&nbsp;Click the thumbnail of the page you want to view, or press the Left and Right arrow keys to scroll among all pages.<br><img src="assets/proof-static-view-magazine.png" alt="proof_static_view_magazine.png"></td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> </li> 
</ol>

## Use thumbnails

The thumbails panel displays on the left side of the `proofing viewer`. You can use the thumbnails area to navigate throughout the `proof`. Thumbnails are especially useful when a `proof` contains multiple pages.

* [Hide and display the thumbnails panel](#hiding-and-displaying-the-thumbnails-panel) 
* [Zoom and pan in the thumbnail view](#zooming-and-panning-in-the-thumbnails-panel)

### Hide and display the thumbnails panel

The thumbnails panel displays by default. You can hide or adjust the size of the panel.

* [Hide the thumbnails panel](#hiding-the-thumbnails-panel) 
* [Adjust the size of the thumbnails panel](#adjusting-the-size-of-the-thumbnails-panel)

 <li value="2">Drag the edge to resize the panel.</li> 
</ol>

### Zoom and pan in the thumbnail view

The zoom area in the thumbnails panel displays the area of the `proof` you are currently viewing. You can adjust the zoom within the thumbnail area or you can pan the area to view a different part of the `proof`.

You can also zoom and pan in the main area of the `proof`, as described in [Zoom and pan a proof](#zooming-and-panning-a-proof).

To zoom and pan in the thumbnail view:

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Locate the current zoom area in the thumbnails panel.<br>The zoom area displays as a blue frame around the edges of the thumbnail.</p> <p> <img src="assets/zoom-thumbnail---frame-350x215.png" alt="zoom_thumbnail_-_frame.png" style="width: 350;height: 215;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="2">To adjust the size of the zoom area, drag the lower-right corner of the zoom area until it is the desired size.</li> 
 <li value="3">To move the zoom area to another part of the <span>proof</span>, drag the zoom area until it covers the part of the <span>proof</span> you want to view.</li> 
</ol>

## Search text within a `proof`

You can search text within any `proof`&nbsp;that is created from any of the following file types:

</ol>

## Rotate a `proof`

You can rotate the `proof` within the `proofing viewer`. When you rotate a `proof` that contains multiple pages, all pages are rotated simultaneously.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>Click the <span class="bold">Rotate</span> icon at the bottom of the <span>proofing viewer</span>.</p> <p> <img src="assets/proof-viewer-static-rotate-350x36.png" alt="proof_viewer_static_rotate.png" style="width: 350;height: 36;"> </p> <p>The <span>proof</span> is rotated 90 degrees each time you click the <span class="bold">Rotate</span> icon.<br></p> </li> 
</ol>

## Zoom and pan a `proof`

You can adjust the zoom percentage when viewing the `proof`. When viewing a `proof` at a larger zoom percentage, the Pan option allows you to use the cursor to navigate to different areas of the `proof`.

Alternatively, you can use the thumbnail area to zoom and pan within the `proof`, as described in [Zoom and pan a proof](#zooming-and-panning-a-proof).

## Enable and disable the `Web Proofing Viewer`

Depending on settings configured by your `Workfront administrator`, you might see the `Web Proofing Viewer` when viewing static  `proofs`, or you might see the Legacy `proofing viewer`. If your system is configured to use the `Web Proofing Viewer` and you need to switch to the Legacy `proofing viewer`, you can do so by disabling the `Web Proofing Viewer`.&nbsp;

You might not have access to the Legacy `proofing viewer` because it is supported by Flash, which has been deprecated in most environments.

### Enable the `Web Proofing Viewer`

To enable the `Web Proofing Viewer`:

1. Click  `Open new `proofing` viewer` near the lower-left corner of the Legacy `proofing viewer`.

   The system remembers this setting until you clear your browser cache.

### Disable the `Web Proofing Viewer`

Depending on your organization's configuration, you may be able to disable the `Web Proofing Viewer` and use the Legacy `proofing viewer`:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Click the <span class="bold">Legacy viewer&nbsp;</span>icon near the lower-left corner of the <span>Web Proofing Viewer</span>. <img src="assets/legacy-viewer-icon.png" alt="Legacy_Viewer_icon.png"></li> 
</ol>
