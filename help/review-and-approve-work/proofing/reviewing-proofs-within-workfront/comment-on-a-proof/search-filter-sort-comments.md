  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or *Proof Permission Profile* you have, contact your *Workfront* or *Workfront Proof administrator*.

## Search the comment list

You can search the comment list for text contained in the comment itself, comment number, or the use who made the comment.

1. Go to the project, task, or issue that contains the document, then select `Documents`.
1. Find the *proof* you need, then click `Open *proof*`.

1. (Conditional) If the comments area is not open, click  `View comments`&nbsp;in the upper-right corner.
1. Click the `Search` icon to display the search box.  

1. Begin typing either of the following:

  * The text you want to search for. The comment list filters as you type, beginning with the first character&nbsp;you enter.
  * The number of the comment you want to display.
  * The user who made the comment.

1. (Optional) Click the comment to display a line connecting the comment to the related area on the *proof*.
1. When you are finished searching and you want to display all the comments, click the X at the end of the search box.

## Filter the comment list

You can filter the comments that display by defining filter parameter such as user, actions, unread status, and more.
