# Comment on a proof

Comments enable you&nbsp;to provide feedback on content and collaborate with other users in the proofing viewer.

When tagging users in comments on a proof, the users you are able to tag might differ depending on various factors, such as individual user permissions and your membership in the organization:

* If you are the proof creator, owner, or have specific permissions enabled, you can tag users outside of the proof workflow and share the proof with them.
* If you were added to the proof as an outside user and you are a member of another environment with a different proof account, you can tag only those users from your original environment. For more information, see [Proofing collaboration limitations with people outside of your organization](../../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/tips-tricks-and-troubleshooting/collaboration-with-members-outside-of-your-organization.md)

(This applies only to the regular annotation markup tools, not the text markup tools.)
