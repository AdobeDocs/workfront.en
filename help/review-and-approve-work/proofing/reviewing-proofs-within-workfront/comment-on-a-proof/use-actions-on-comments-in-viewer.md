# Use actions on proof comments

You can use actions to keep track of what needs to happen on each comment thread on a proof. An action is a word or phrase such as "To do," "Done," or "In progress" that your Adobe Workfront administrator configures in the system for your organization. Reviewers can add an action to a comment to provide information about what has been done or what still needs to be done in response to the comment.

For information about how your Workfront administrator enables and configures actions, see&nbsp; [Configure proof settings for your organization](../../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/configure-proofing-organization.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:
