# Manage notifications for proof comments and decisions

When you work on a proof, whether you are a Adobe Workfront user or an external collaborator, you can specify which email notifications you want to receive about comments and decisions made on the proof. For more information, see [Notifications for proof comments and decisions overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/notifications-proof-comments-decisions.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>These notifications are different from the email alerts you can receive about the flow of a proof among reviewers. They are also different from the email alert settings you can configure in Workfront.&nbsp;

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">
