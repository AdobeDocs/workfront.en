  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, role, or `Proof Permission Profile` you have, contact your `Workfront` or `Workfront Proof administrator`.

## Open and work with a video proof

1. Go to the document list that contains the video `proof` you want to open.
1. Hover over the document, then click  `Open proof`.

   You can `proof` video content in the `Web Proofing Viewer` or the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`. The viewer that opens depends on how your `Adobe Workfront administrator` has configured your organization's `proofing viewer`s.

1. Do any of the following:

* Comment on the proof, as explained in [Comment on a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/comment-on-a-proof/comment-on-proof.md).
* Use `proofing viewer` functionality described in the remaining sections below.

For information about creating a video `proof`, see .

For general information that relates to reviewing `proofs`, see [Review proofs within Adobe Workfront](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/reviewing-proofs-within-workfront/review-proofs-in-wf.md).

If you cannot use a `proofing viewer` as described in this section, consult your `Workfront administrator`.

## Change the unit of measurement of the timeline

You can adjust the unit of measurement that is used in the video timeline. You can view the timeline in Time, Frame, or Timecode.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> <p>In the lower-left corner of the <span>proofing viewer</span>, click the current unit of measurement.</p> <p> <img src="assets/phq-viewer-video-timeline.png"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Select from the following options:</p> 
  <table cellspacing="0"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Time</td> 
     <td>Displays the video timeline in minutes/seconds.<p>This option is selected by default.</p></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Frame</td> 
     <td>Displays the video timeline in frames.<p>The <span>proofing viewer</span> uses the information on&nbsp;the original file to determine the number of frames per second that is displayed.</p></td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Timecode</td> 
     <td>Displays the video timeline in timecode. The numbers of the timecode represent hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. <p>For example, a timecode of 1:48:36:18 represents 1 hour, 48 minutes, 36 seconds, and 18 frames into the video.</p></td>

When viewing a `proof` at a larger zoom percentage, the Pan option allows you to use your mouse to navigate to different areas of the `proof`. This is especially useful when you are reviewing small GIF videos, content in a small area, and virtual reality video content, which displays wide in the Proofing Viewer.

<ol> 
 <li value="1">While viewing a video <span>proof</span> in the <span>proofing viewer</span>, do any of the following to adjust the zoom percentage of the <span>proof</span> (see also the shortcuts for these actions in <a href="../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-wpv/keyboard-shortcuts.md" class="MCXref xref">Keyboard shortcuts in the Workfront Proof proofing viewer</a>):
