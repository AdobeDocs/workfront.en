# Install the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` {#install-the-desktop-proofing-viewer}

The `Desktop Proofing Viewer`, which is designed primarily for `proofing` interactive content, is an application that must be installed on your local machine. This application&nbsp;is supported on the following operating systems:



* Windows 7 and later, 32-bit and 64-bit
* Mac OS X 10.9 and later, 64-bit


If you need information about the various `proofing` viewers,&nbsp;see&nbsp; [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer](understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md)&nbsp;


If you need information about the transition from the Legacy `proofing viewer` to the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` (for interactive `proofs`), see [Legacy proofing viewer removed in 2018.3](lpv-removed-2018.md)&nbsp;


>[!NOTE]
>
>(You might not have access to the Legacy `proofing viewer` because it is supported by Flash, which has been deprecated in most environments.) Only the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` supports interactive `proofing` of websites that are iframe-protected or non-secure. If your organization is using the Legacy `proofing viewer` for interactive `proofs` and you are creating or opening an interactive `proof` with either of these properties, the steps below will not work. However, you can use the `Web Proofing Viewer` or the Legacy `proofing viewer` to `proof` the website as a static (non-interactive) `proof`.




## Install the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` on Mac {#install-the-desktop-proofing-viewer-on-mac}

If your `Workfront administrator` or `Workfront Proof administrator` has downloaded the app on your workstation and configured the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` as the default viewer for interactive `proofs`, you can finish the installation simply by opening an interactive `proof`, as described in [Review an interactive proof](review-and-managing-interactive-proofs.md).


If this is not the case, you can follow the steps below. 



1.  Do one of the following to download the app:   

    
    
    * If you are using the Production environment, click  [Mac Production Download for the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`.](https://cdn.proofhq.com/nativeviewer/desktop_viewer/Workfront+Proof.pkg)
    *  If you are using the Preview environment, click  [Mac Preview Download for the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`.](https://cdn.preview.proofhq.com/nativeviewer/desktop_viewer/Workfront+Proof+Preview.pkg)
    
    

1. Open the file you have just downloaded to start the installation.
1.  On the installation box that appears, click **Continue**, then click **Install**.

1.  Open an interactive `proof` as described in [Review an interactive proof](review-and-managing-interactive-proofs.md).



After the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` is installed, all interactive `proofs` open in the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`, as described in [Review an interactive proof](review-and-managing-interactive-proofs.md). If the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` does not launch when you open an interactive `proof`, this probably means that your `Workfront` or `Workfront Proof administrator` needs to configure the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` as the default viewer for interactive `proofs`, as described in&nbsp; [Install the Desktop Proofing Viewer for your organization](install-desktop-proofing-viewer-org.md).
