If your *Adobe Workfront administrator* or *Workfront Proof administrator* has downloaded the app on your workstation and configured the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* as the default viewer for interactive *proofs*, you can finish the installation simply by opening an interactive *proof*from the Documents area.

If this is not the case, you can follow the steps below.

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> Do one of the following to download the app: <br>
  <ul>
   <li>If you are using the Production environment, click&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.proofhq.com/nativeviewer/desktop_viewer/Workfront+Proof.pkg">Mac Production Download for the <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em>.</a></li>
   <li> If you are using the Preview environment, click&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.preview.proofhq.com/nativeviewer/desktop_viewer/Workfront+Proof+Preview.pkg">Mac Preview Download for the <em>Desktop Proofing Viewer</em>.</a></li>
  </ul></li> 
 <li value="2">Open the file you have just downloaded to start the installation.</li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>On the installation box that appears, click <span class="bold">Continue</span>, then click <span class="bold">Install</span>.<br></p> <p> <img src="assets/00000776-350x244.png" alt="00000776.png" style="width: 350;height: 244;"> </p> </li> 
 <li value="4"> Open an interactive <em>proof</em> from the Documents area. </li> 
</ol>

>[!NOTE]

>If the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* does not launch when you open an interactive *proof*, this probably means that your *Workfront* or *Workfront Proof administrator* needs to configure the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* as the default viewer for interactive *proofs*, as described in&nbsp; [Install the Desktop Proofing Viewer for your organization](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/install-desktop-proofing-viewer-org.md).

</ol>

After the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* is installed, all interactive *proofs* open in the *Desktop Proofing Viewer*. If the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* does not launch when you open an interactive *proof*, this probably means that your *Workfront* or *Workfront Proof administrator* needs to configure the *Desktop Proofing Viewer* as the default viewer for interactive *proofs*, as described in&nbsp; [Install the Desktop Proofing Viewer for your organization](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-workfront/configure-proofing/install-desktop-proofing-viewer-org.md).
