# Interactive content `proofs` overview

Interactive content provides multiple methods of engaging viewers. Agencies can measure the success of their campaigns using analytics gathered from responses to this content.

Examples of interactive content include:

* Websites
* Embedded or streaming videos
* Interactive banners
* HTML5 animations
* Microsites
* Interactive emails

This article provides the following about `proofing` interactive content:

## About creating `proofs` for interactive content

You can create a `proof` for interactive content in one of the following ways:

* Create a `proof` from a ZIP file containing the interactive content.

  `Adobe Workfront` unpacks the content from the ZIP file and stores it on a `Workfront` server. Because it is stored this way, you can rely on the content staying the same throughout the `proof` review cycle.

* Specify the URL for the content.

  This is the simplest way to create a `proof` for interactive content. This is also the only way you can review your content interactively, as users experience it on the internet.

  With this approach, an external server unknown to `Workfront` stores and hosts the content.

  We recommend this method for a large websites because it is difficult to gather all of the files that make up a large website. However, because the `proof`'s content is stored externally, `Workfront` cannot protect it from changes made by the developers working on it, so you might not be able to rely on the content staying the same throughout the `proof` review cycle.

## About preparing interactive content in a ZIP file for `proofing`

When you bundle interactive content in a ZIP file for `proofing`, make sure that it includes the following specifications:

* All assets, such as CSS, JavaScript, videos, sounds, and images should be included in the bundle file.
* Interactive content should include the main file (index.html, index.htm). If this&nbsp;file is not placed in the root location, the tool automatically searches the folder to find it.&nbsp;The main file does not need to be named&nbsp;index.html/index.htm, however, there can be only one .html/.htm file placed in the main location.
* The file must contain at least one static file webpage.
* The maximum bundle size is 500 MB.
* In the case of .zip files created in iOS, the tool automatically identifies the folder where the content is located
* Interactive projects are supported only as .zip archives. Standard .zip file submissions will fail.
* The website must be secure (HTTPS).

  This is not a requirement when using the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`.

  For more information, see [Understand the Desktop Proofing Viewer](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-dpv/destop-proofing-viewer.md).

* The website must be allowed to be viewed in an iframe.

  This is not a requirement when using the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`.

  For more information, see [Understand the Desktop Proofing Viewer](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/review-proofs-dpv/destop-proofing-viewer.md).

## About creating an interactive `proof`

After you prepare your ZIP bundle file, create an interactive `proof`.

For more information, see [Create a proof for interactive content in a ZIP file](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/creating-proofs-within-workfront/generate-proof-interactive-content-.md).

Or, if you are using `Workfront Proof`, see the section [Generate a proof for interactive content](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md#generati) in the article [Generate Proofs in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-work-proofsfiles/create-proofs-and-files/generate-proofs.md).

## About reviewing interactive `proofs`

We recommend that you use the standalone `Desktop Proofing Viewer` as the default viewer for interactive `proofs`. However, if your organization's policies do not allow the use of the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` app, your `Workfront administrator` can configure your system so that you can review interactive content, bundled in a ZIP archive file, in the `Web Proofing Viewer`. For comparative information about the `Desktop Proofing Viewer` and the `Web Proofing Viewer`, see [Differences between the Web Proofing Viewer and the Desktop Proofing Viewer overview](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/proofing-overview/understand-differences-between-web-viewer.md).
