# Get information about the service (not yet implemented)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The release date for this feature is yet to be determined.

Returns information about the service, such as features and capabilities. `Adobe Workfront` will use this information to customize the user interface in `Workfront`. For example, if the webhook implementation contains some custom actions, the JSON should list those operations in the JSON. Users would then be able to invoke these actions from `Workfront`.

## URL

GET /serviceInfo

## Query Parameters

None. In addition, calls to this endpoint should not require authentication.

## Response

JSON containing information about this service
