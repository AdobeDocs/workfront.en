# R1 release activity overview {#r-release-activity-overview}

This page provides information about the functionality included in the R1 release.&nbsp;


The R1 release is currently available to test in Preview; R1 releases to the Production environment in a phased rollout on the evenings of April 26 and 27, 2017 (MDT).


The R1 release enables users, knowledge workers, and administrators to better manage their work. With R1, adminstrators can customize `Workfront` to better match the organization's terminology; knowledge workers can leverage utilization reports to better understand how projects are tracking against planned and budgeted hours; users can engage in `Workfront` directly from Outlook 365 and be more productive when using the `Workfront` mobile app; and much more.
