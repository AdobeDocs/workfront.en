For more information, see [TLS 1.2 to be required in Workfront](tls-1-disabled.md).


### Flash Application Removal {#flash-application-removal}

All functionality that relies on Flash technology will be removed from `Workfront` with the 2018.3 release and replaced with a new solution.


This functionality includes:



*  Legacy Gantt Chart will be replaced with the new Gantt Chart


  For more information, see [View information in the Gantt Chart](view-info-in-gantt.md).

*  Portfolio Optimizer will be replaced with the new Portfolio Optimizer


  For more information, see [Portfolio Optimizer overview](portfolio-optimizer-overview.md).

  For more information, see [Resource Planning](_resource-planning-overview.md).

*  Budget Manager will be replaced with the new Resource Planner


  For more information, see [Resource Planning](_resource-planning-overview.md) [.](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001049327)  


*  Resource Grid will be replaced with the new Resource Planner


  For more information, see [ [Resource Planning](_resource-planning-overview.md).](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001049327)

    * [Reviewing Proofs in the `Desktop Proofing Viewer`](https://support.workfront.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000686434)
    
    





### Microsoft Outlook Add-in Support Is Ending {#microsoft-outlook-add-in-support-is-ending}

`Workfront` will no longer support the desktop version of the add-in after the 18.2 product release in July.


Now is the time to switch to `Workfront` for Outlook and become a productivity powerhouse! Instead of providing two distinct add-ins for Outlook, we now provide one universal add-in which can be used in any environment: on a PC, Mac, Desktop, Web, and even on the Outlook mobile app.


When you install the new `Workfront` for Outlook on any of your environments, your team can get more done, stay organized, and prioritize their work in real time.


Use the following resources to learn more about `Workfront` for Outlook and get started:



* [Website and video](https://www.workfront.com/integrations/outlook)&nbsp;
* [Using `Workfront` with Outlook](_workfront-for-outlook.md)&nbsp;(help article)




### Removing Old API Versions {#removing-old-api-versions}

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our API, we are removing old API versions that are no longer compatible with more recent releases of `Workfront`.


See the [API versioning and support schedule](api-version-support-schedule.md) for more information.&nbsp;
