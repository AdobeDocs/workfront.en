This page describes changes made to the *`Workfront Proof`* (stand-alone proofing application). Changes described here are not applicable to the proofing functionality within the *`Adobe Workfront`* application. 


## New Proof Permission Profile in Workfront Proof {#new-proof-permission-profile-in-workfront-proof}

We've added a new Visitor Proof Permission Profile in Workfront Proof. This new profile is similar to the existing Observer profile.


Users with a Visitor profile can review and approve proofs shared with them. However, they can't view any contacts or groups as Observers can.


For more information, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).
