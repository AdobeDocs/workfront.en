# `Workfront Proof` release activity:&nbsp;Week of November 29, 2021

This page describes changes made to the `Workfront Proof` (stand-alone proofing application). Changes described here are not applicable to the proofing functionality within the `Adobe Workfront` application.

## New Proof Permission Profile in Workfront Proof

We've added a new Visitor Proof Permission Profile in Workfront Proof. This new profile is similar to the existing Observer profile.

Users with a Visitor profile can review and approve proofs shared with them. However, they can't view any contacts or groups as Observers can.

For more information, see [Proof Permissions Profiles in Workfront Proof](../../../workfront-proof/wp-acct-admin/account-settings/proof-perm-profiles-in-wp.md).
