## New workflow for aligning goals {#new-workflow-for-aligning-goals}

We have improved the way aligning a goal works. Now, you can see a new “Align to another goal” link in the Goal Details panel where you can align your goal to a parent goal. Prior to this improvement, the option to align a goal was not readily visible. Instead, it was one of the options listed in the gear icon of the “Align to” section of Goal Details.


For information about aligning goals, see [Align goals by connecting them in Adobe Workfront Goals](align-goals-by-connecting-them.md).

## Updated the color for the Draft status of goals {#updated-the-color-for-the-draft-status-of-goals}

Based on the feedback we have received from you, we have updated the Draft status for goals to yellow. Prior to this enhancement the color for drafted goals was red which might have been perceived as an error or a problem.


For information about goal statuses, see [Goal status overview in Adobe Workfront Goals](goal-status-overview.md).
