## Eliminate the “My Teams” tab for users without teams {#eliminate-the-my-teams-tab-for-users-without-teams}

To eliminate the confusion of displaying an empty tab, we have removed the "My Teams" tab from users who are not assigned to any teams. Prior to this change, if a user didn’t belong to any teams, the My Teams tab was empty.
