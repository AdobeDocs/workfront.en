*  The current Behind goal Progress has been renamed to At Risk (yellow indicator)
*  The current At Risk goal Progress has been renamed to In Trouble (green indicator)

## Consistent navigation and toolbar with new filter experience in Workfront Goals {#consistent-navigation-and-toolbar-with-new-filter-experience-in-workfront-goals}

To create a familiar experience across all Workfront products, we have redesigned the main navigation and the goal lists in Workfront Goals. This new design is consistent with the way you interact with all other areas and lists in Workfront and includes the following features:



*  The left panel now matches that of all other areas that you can access from the Main Menu.
*  A new toolbar has been added to lists to include options for pagination (Goal List, Pulse) and expanding and printing the goal list (Goal List).
*  The tabs at the top of the Workfront Goals sections have been eliminated.
*  The tabs and filters have been replaced by a new filter menu which is consistent with other filters in Workfront, like the one in the Workload Balancer. You can now apply filters to all pages of Workfront Goals except for the Check-in section. Prior to this change, the Goal Alignment chart had limited filtering options.
