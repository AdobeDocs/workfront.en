## Report on goal information {#report-on-goal-information}



>[!NOTE]

>Goal information can be included in reports both in *`the new Adobe Workfront experience`* and in *`Adobe Workfront Classic`*. 


You can now build Goal reports or Project reports that include information about associated goals in Workfront. Your company must purchase and enable Workfront Goals, but once they do, you can build the reports in both the new Workfront experience as well as Workfront classic.


You can now do the following to see goal information in reports:

    *  Goal Hierarchy: displays all parent goals and how they connect to each other.
    *  Is Company Goal: indicates whether your organization is designated as the Owner of a goal
    *  Owner Type: indicates whether the Owner of a goal is a user, team, or group.
