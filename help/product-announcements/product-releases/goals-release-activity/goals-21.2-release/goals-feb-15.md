## Temporarily show filtered goals in the Alignment Chart {#temporarily-show-filtered-goals-in-the-alignment-chart}

When viewing goals in the Alignment Chart, you can now temporarily display the goals that do not match the filter so you can get the full picture of all aligned goals. You can also reapply the filter and return to the filtered goals.


Prior to this enhancement, there was an indication that some goals are removed by the filter, but you could not view them.


For information about the Alignment Chart, see [Navigate the Goal Alignment section in Adobe Workfront Goals](navigate-goal-alignment-chart.md).
