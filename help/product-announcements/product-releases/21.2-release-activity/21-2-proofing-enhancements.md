# 21.2 Proofing enhancements

This page describes all *Proofing* enhancements made with the *21.2* release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of May 10, 2021. For a list of all changes available with the *21.2* release, see [21.2 Release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/21.2-release-activity/21-2-release-overview.md).

## Proof decision now visible in the Documents list

>[!NOTE]
>
>Available only in *the new Adobe Workfront experience*.

The overall proof decision is now visible on the default document list view.

With this enhancement, you can easily see all proofs that have an overall decision directly within the default list view. This makes it extremely simple to spot your proof progress without needing to navigate to different pages.

Previously, you were required to go to the document details and proof workflow in order to view the overall proof decision, which required multiple clicks.

For more information about proof decisions, see

-->

[The Documents area](../../../documents/managing-documents/documents-area.md).

This feature is now included in the [Manage proofs and versions in the new Workfront experience](https://one.workfront.com/s/learningpath3/manage-proofs-and-versions-in-the-new-workfront-experience-MCPBYNLTQSS5H4NG7C27IPCVR5YA) learning path on Workfront One.

## New fields on the Proof Approval report

To help surface useful proofing information, we've added the following fields to the Proof Approval report:

* `Decision Date:`&nbsp;Displays the date an approver makes a decision on a proof. You can also find this date on the Print Summary of the proof.
* `Approver Stage:`&nbsp;Displays the current stage information.
* `Workflow Template:`&nbsp;Displays any workflow templates attached to the proof. If there is no template attached, the column is blank.

These fields are not part of the default report. You need to add them if you want to see them.

This feature is now included in the [Proof system setups, Part 2: Workflow management](https://one.workfront.com/s/learningpath3/proof-system-setups-part-2-workflow-management-MCKUF6NTIJ6BGMXHBCXXX6NN53EA) learning path on Workfront One.

## Carry over the existing proof workflow when generating a new version

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was removed from the Preview environment on March 30, 2021 and from the Production environment on April 1, 2021. It will not be included with the 21.1 release.

Now, the existing proof workflow carries over to any new versions you create, no matter the method in which they are generated.

Previously, there was a slight difference in how the proof workflow was carried over depending on where you generated them in Workfront.

For more information, see [Create a new version of a proof](../../../review-and-approve-work/proofing/managing-proofs-within-workfront/create-new-proof-version.md).
