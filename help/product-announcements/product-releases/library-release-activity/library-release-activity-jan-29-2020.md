# Workfront Library release activity - January 29, 2020

This page describes all changes made available to `Workfront Library` with the release to the Production environment on January 22.

For a list of all changes made to `Workfront Library`, see [Workfront Library release activity](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/library-release-activity/workfront-library-release-activity.md).

The `Workfront Library` release on January 22 contains the following enhancements:

## Updated look and feel of User, Job roles, Teams, Groups, and Companies screens

The Workfront Library Setup area now has an updated look and feel. This user screen now contains the following columns:

* Name
* Access level
* Access sources
* # of assets

## Updates to editing access levels of users and user groupings

Use the More menu next to the individual user's name to change a user's access level. You can no longer make changes in bulk, unless you are changing the access level of a job role, team, group, or company from Workfront Library.

Previously, the Edit button located at the top of the User screen (as well as the Job roles, Teams, Groups, and Companies screens) allowed you to change access levels for each selected user.

For more information, see

* [Change a user's access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/change-user-access.md)

## Updates to removing users and user groupings from Workfront Library

Use the More menu next the individual user's name to remove a user. You can no longer remove users in bulk, unless you are removing a job role, team, group, or company from Workfront Library.

Previously, the Remove button located at the top of the User screen (as well as the Job roles, Teams, Groups, and Companies screens) allowed you to remove each select user from Workfront Library.

For more information, see

* [Remove a user's access to Workfront Library](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/user-access/remove-a-users-access-library.md)

## Transfer ownership of assets

Workfront Library administrators can transfer these assets to a different user during the removal process. They also have the option of transfering assets after removal by locating them on the Deactivated users list.

Previously, when users with assets were removed from Workfront Library, these assets were no longer owned by any user.

For more information, see [Transfer ownership assets to another user](../../../workfront-library/administration-and-setup/manage-assets/transfer-ownership-to-others.md).
