# *`Workfront Library`* release activity - May 3, 2019 {#workfront-library-release-activity-may}

This page describes all changes made available to *`Workfront Library`* with the release to the Production environment on May 3.


For a list of all changes made to *`Workfront Library`*, see [Workfront Library release activity](_workfront-library-release-activity.md).


The *`Workfront Library`* release on May 3 contains the following enhancements:


## Cover Images Display for Folders and Collections {#cover-images-display-for-folders-and-collections}

Now you can use cover images to more easily identify the contents and scope of folders and collections. When you create a folder, you can select the cover image using the thumbnail of any asset in *`Workfront Library`* (this functionality will soon be available for collections). For information on selecting a cover image for a folder, see [Create a folder in Workfront Library](create-a-folder-library.md). 


If you don't select a cover image for a folder or if you create a collection, *`Workfront Library`* selects a cover image based on the items contained in the folder or the collection. You can change the cover image for folders to which you have Manage permissions. For more information see, [Change the cover image on an item in Workfront Library](change-cover-image-of-folder.md).`<iframe class="vimeo-player_0" src="assets/334532557?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1" width="560px" height="315px"></iframe>`


## Expiration Metadata for Documents Sent from *`Workfront`* to *`Workfront Library`*  {#expiration-metadata-for-documents-sent-from-workfront-to-workfront-library}

If your metadata taxonomy allows for content expiration, you can now specify an expiration date for documents that you send from Workfront to *`Workfront Library`*. Prior to this change, you could not enter an expiration date for documents sent from Workfront. For more information see:



* [Set up content expiration in Workfront Library](set-up-content-expiration-in-library.md)
