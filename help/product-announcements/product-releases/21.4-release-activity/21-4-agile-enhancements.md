This page describes all *`Agile`* enhancements made with the *`21.4`* release to the Preview environment. These enhancements will be made available in the Production environment the week of October 4, 2021. 


For a list of all changes available with the *`21.4`* release, see [21.4 Release overview](21.4-release-overview.md).


## User assignments on Kanban and Scrum boards {#user-assignments-on-kanban-and-scrum-boards}

We have updated the story cards on Kanban and Scrum boards to make it easier to assign a user to the story. Now you can click a team or user avatar to add an assignment when the story card is expanded. Previously, you had to locate and click a separate plus sign icon.


For more information, see 



*  [Assign users to a story on the Kanban board](assign-users-to-a-story.md) 
*  [Assign users to a story on the Scrum board](assign-users-to-a-story-scrum.md) 




## Configure how dates are applied when adding work items to a Scrum iteration {#configure-how-dates-are-applied-when-adding-work-items-to-a-scrum-iteration}

By default, when you add a work item to an iteration, the Planned Start Date and Planned Completion Date on the work item are modified to match the iteration start and dates. Now you can choose to keep the original Planned Start Date and Planned Completion Date on all work items for a team.


This option applies only to Scrum teams and not to Kanban teams.


For more information, see [Configure Scrum](configure-scrum.md).

## Changes to agile view on projects {#changes-to-agile-view-on-projects}



>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature was released to the Preview environment on September 16, 2021.


As part of the 21.3 release, we made improvements to the agile card header and story boards (see [Agile card header and story board updates](21-3-project-enhancements.md#agile)). These updates applied to iterations as well as to the agile view on projects.


With the 21.4 release, we are reverting these enhancements for the agile view on projects. No changes are being made to agile iterations.


Following are the changes that are being reverted regarding the agile view on projects:



*  The story cards and board columns have adjustable widths.
*  Columns do not have background shading.
*  Cards do not have identifier labels (parent story, subtask, story, task, or issue).
*  The Parent Story column has been renamed to Stories.




## Add new stories and issues from the Kanban board {#add-new-stories-and-issues-from-the-kanban-board}

You can now create a new story or issue directly from the Kanban board. This makes it easier to quickly add a new story without having to go to a project, report, or dashboard to create a task.


For more information, see [Add stories and issues from the Kanban board](add-story-from-kanban-board.md).
