## Unified duration and duration unit values for tasks

For a cleaner and more streamlined user experience, we have merged the value of the Duration field with the duration unit of time. Prior to this enhancement, the unit of time displayed in a separate drop-down field after the Duration field.

In addition to the Duration fields in the Task Details, Edit Tasks and New Task boxes, we are also updating the following fields to match this experience:

* Duration field when making advanced assignments
* Leveling Delay field when creating or editing a task
* Frequency field when creating a recurring task (available soon)
* Lag field when adding a predecessor (available soon)

For information, see [Edit tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks.md).

## New for administrators: Find out which custom forms are using a custom field

Now it’s easier to change a custom field in a custom form. With a single click in the custom form, you can find out about any other custom forms that are also using the field. It’s important to assess whether those forms will need adjustments in order to keep working properly after you make the change.

For more information, see [View all custom forms that use a particular custom field](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/create-manage-custom-forms/view-all-custom-forms-that-use-a-particular-custom-field.md).
