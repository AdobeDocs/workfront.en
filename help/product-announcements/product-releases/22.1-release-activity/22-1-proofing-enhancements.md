To provide a more integrated experience between Workfront and Proof, we’ve made several improvements regarding proofing capabilities for Reviewers and Requestors:


You can grant Moderator or Author roles to any user in Workfront, regardless of whether they have a Proofing license, giving them additional rights, like applying actions or resolving comments. 


You can add Reviewers and Requestors to proofs that require a login or that need to be electronically signed.


All users also benefit from improved connectivity between Workfront and Proof. Now, when deactivating a user or updating a user’s email address, your updates are correctly reflected in proofing when changed in Workfront.

*  [User synchronization between Adobe Workfront and Workfront Proof](user-sync-proofing.md) 




## Desktop Viewer Upgrade {#desktop-viewer-upgrade}

We’ve upgraded the Desktop Proofing Viewer to support up to Chrome version 91 for greater compatibility with interactive proofs.

>Windows users must manually reinstall the desktop viewer to upgrade to the latest version. After that, future updates to the Desktop Proofing Viewer will be automatic. For help reinstalling, see [Install the Desktop Proofing Viewer](installing-desktop-proofing-viewer.md).


Mac users will be upgraded to the latest version automatically.


## Electronic Signature Enhancements for proofs {#electronic-signature-enhancements-for-proofs}



>[!NOTE]
>
>Released to Preview environments for EMEA customers only. Functionality coming to US customers soon.


We’ve made it easier for users to sign proofs electronically. Now, users can use their Workfront credentials to sign a decision on a proof.


>[!IMPORTANT] {type="important"}
>
>To electronically sign a proof with SSO credentials, you must set SSO up in *`Workfront Proof`*. For more information on enabling SSO, see [Configure Single Sign-On for Workfront Proof users](configure-sso-for-wp-users.md).


Previously, users had to use Workfront Proof credentials, which are different from their Workfront credentials.
