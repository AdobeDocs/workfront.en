  </tr> Document downloads logged in the Updates area To help your users track downloads of documents they store in Workfront, the system now logs an entry in the Updates area for a document when someone downloads it. We recommend testing this feature in Preview on a newly uploaded document. Preview release: December 16, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic (Workfront Classic will be discontinued in March 2022, followed shortly by the end-of-life date for Workfront Classic in July 2022.) Create OAuth2 apps to integrate applications with Workfront Now you can integrate Workfront with other applications that Workfront doesn't offer a built-in integration for. By creating an OAuth2 app for the application you want to integrate with, you can allow that application to access Workfront, while knowing that your data is protected by the secure, industry-standard OAuth2 authentication protocol. Previously, you could only integrate with other applications through built-in integrations, Workfront Fusion, or the Workfront API. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 8, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Interface text improvements in Companies area In the Companies area in Setup, new confirmation messages and slight wording changes make it easier to manage company memberships. For example, the section name “People” in the left panel is now “Company Members.” Available on these dates: Preview release: December 8, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Add custom forms to groups Custom forms are now supported for the Group object. This makes it easier for groups in your organization to capture and share information that meets their specific needs and workflows. Users can do the same actions for a group that they can for other Workfront objects, such as create a custom form, attach a custom form, save a custom form, and more. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 8, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Styling updates in the Custom Forms area The Custom Forms area has a new look and feel that brings it up to date with many other areas in the new Workfront experience. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Many enhancements for creating calculated custom fields Creating calculated custom fields is now much easier with these additions in the new Calculation Editor: You can hover over any expression in your calculation to display information about it, including a description, an example of how it can be used, and a link to more information in a help article. Each expression you add is color-coded, depending on its type. This makes it easier to spot your expressions and immediately recognize their type. Line numbers help you identify and reference functions in a long calculation. When you start typing an expression or field name, a list of available items displays so that you can choose the one you want. And, when you type an open parenthesis, the closing parenthesis is added automatically. You can preview the result of your calculation using an existing object without leaving the calculation editor. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 3, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Select expressions and fields in the new calculated field window We're continuing to make it easier to create a calculated field in a custom form.

Available on these dates: Preview release: October 21, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Larger area for creating calculated fields Now it’s easier to build complex calculated fields in a custom form.

Available on these dates: Preview release: October 14, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Grant access to teams using access levels A new section in the Access Levels area gives you more granular controls for managing your users’ access to teams.

Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Group mapping now available in blueprints Some blueprints now include groups, which you can customize before installing the blueprint.

Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Blueprints company mapping and other enhancements Some blueprints now include companies, which you can customize before installing the blueprint. You can map a company in the blueprint to an existing company in your Workfront instance, or create a new company if needed. Other enhancements to Blueprints are also available. Available on these dates: Preview release: November 11, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience View audit log information about statuses and companies Now you can more easily troubleshoot incidents involving statuses and companies by viewing information about them in the Audit Logs area in Setup. For example: You can find out who renamed, locked, or hid a status, and when they did so. You can find out who removed some members or job roles from a company, and when they did so. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 3, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Manage company memberships more easily In the Companies area, an updated toolbar makes it easy to add existing Workfront users to a company and to remove company members. Previously, these actions were available only in the Edit Company box. The updated toolbar also contains all of the actions that were available in the previous toolbar, such as editing members’ user profile information and deactivating them in the system. Available on these dates: Preview release: November 4, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Groups can configure their own timesheet and hour preferences In a large organization, some groups might need to configure timesheet and hour preferences independently to fit their unique workflows, rather than inheriting the preferences configured by an administrator at the system level. Now Workfront administrators can unlock a timesheet and hour preference for all groups in the system so that they can configure it on their own. This ability was also added recently for project preferences and for task and issue preferences. Available on these dates: Preview release: September 9, 2021 Production release: November 8, 2021 (This feature was made available in Production only to customers on Cluster 4 with the 21.4 release; it was made available for all other clusters in Production on November 8, 2021.) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic (Workfront Classic will be discontinued in March 2022, followed shortly by the end-of-life date for Workfront Classic in July 2022.) Select multiple notifications that you want to unlock or re-lock for groups It's now faster and easier to unlock or re-lock email notifications for groups. Now you can select multiple notifications, check your selections to make sure they’re correct, then click the new Unlock or Lock button that displays in the toolbar. Previously, you had to unlock and re-lock notifications one at a time. Workfront currently has 95 notifications, so this took a while if you had to do it for all or many of them. Available on these dates: Preview release: October 14, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic (Workfront Classic will be discontinued in March 2022, followed shortly by the end-of-life date for Workfront Classic in July 2022.)

You can use the new info icon to make sure you are selecting the replacement group you want. Available on these dates: Preview release: October 14, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience

  </tr> Share a document folder Now you can share a document folder and its contents from the Documents area. Previously this was not possible—you had to share each document in a folder separately. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 16, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Limit the ability to add documents to a template you are sharing Sometimes people add documents to a project template thinking that they’re adding them to a project. Now you can help to prevent this—when you share a template with View access, you can disable the new advanced setting Add Documents. This disables your recipients’ ability to add documents to the template. Available on these dates: Preview release: October 14, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic (Workfront Classic will be discontinued in March 2022, followed shortly by the end-of-life date for Workfront Classic in July 2022.)

You can also check documents in and out in the document details section. Previously, you had to go to the custom forms tab in the Document Details to make edits or add custom forms. Available on these dates: Preview release: November 18, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Filter by user list on agile boards shows users with most assignments first Now the filter shows the users with the most assignments first so they are easier to locate without scrolling through the list. Previously, the filter by user list on both Kanban and Scrum boards was displayed alphabetically. Available on these dates: Preview release: November 11, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release (Removed from the 22.1 release. No longer available in Preview.) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Change the default option for predecessors when copying or moving tasks To minimize the number of manual steps when copying or moving tasks, we have updated the information that is copied or moved with the task by default. Now, all predecessors are copied or moved with the task by default, as the All Predecessors option is selected by default. Prior to this enhancement, the All Predecessors option was deselected by default when copying or moving a task. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New experience when copying one or multiple tasks To make your use of Workfront consistent with the new Adobe Workfront experience, we have redesigned the interface when copying a task.

Available on these dates: Preview release: November 18, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New experience when moving one or multiple tasks from a list To offer a consistent experience when performing the same task, we have now updated the interface for moving one or multiple tasks from a list to match the experience when moving the task at the task level.

Available on these dates: Preview release: October 21, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience New experience when converting an issue to a project using a template at the issue level To make your use of Workfront consistent with the new Workfront experience, we have redesigned the interface for converting an issue to a project when using a template when you convert it from the issue page.

  </tr> Improvements to the Settings panel and ability to color-code projects and their tasks in the Workload Balancer To improve your experience when using the Workload Balancer, we have introduced the following enhancements: Redesigned the Settings panel to include options that previously were located on the toolbar. This improves the use of the space in the toolbar. Added the ability to customize the color theme by Project. When selecting to color-code by Project, each project and its work items display in the same color. The colors are unique to each project. Before this enhancement, you could only color-code by Project Status. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Assign work in bulk using the Workload Balancer In continuing our effort to deprecate the Scheduling tools and replace them with the Workload Balancer, we have added the ability to manage assignments in bulk. You can now assign multiple work items at a time to multiple users, replace users from multiple work items with other users, and unassign users from multiple items at one time. You can perform all these with one action by using the new Bulk Assignment functionality in the Workload Balancer. Prior to this enhancement, you could only assign one user to one work item either manually or by dragging and dropping. The new Bulk Assignments also include new filtering capabilities by Project and Task Status, in addition to Name. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Override currency when managing job roles To help you easily manage cost and billing rates across global organizations, we have implemented overriding the currency of a job role.

This will override the system currency in all financial calculations for the job role.

  </tr> Interface improvement for users who don’t have access to create requests To improve users’ experience when working with requests, we have introduced an improvement to the interface that indicates to the logged-in user that they do not have access to create requests. With this improvement, the New request button is dimmed for users without access to create issues. Hovering over the dimmed button displays a tooltip that explains that the Workfront administrator restricted the current user’s access to create requests. Prior to this enhancement, the New request button did not display in the Requests area for these users. Copying and submitting a request as new is also restricted. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Copy and submit requests To optimize your process for submitting requests, we are introducing new functionality that allows you to copy an existing request and submit it as a new request. This is helpful when you submit similar requests frequently. In this case, you can reuse an existing request, make a few changes, then submit it as a new request. With this change, users who can view requests that others submitted can also copy these requests and submit them as new. You can prevent this from happening by updating the following setting in the request queue project: People from the same company will inherit the same permissions for all requests. You cannot copy and resubmit issues that were submitted to a request queue without a queue topic before this functionality was released. Available on these dates: Preview release: November 18, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Updated Summary panel experience in the Submitted section of the Requests area To improve visibility and interaction with the Summary panel, we have added a label to the Open Summary icon in the Submitted section of the Requests area. The label is now dynamic and it updates depending on whether the panel is open or closed. When opening the Summary panel without first selecting a request, a more user-friendly image now displays to clearly instruct the user to select an item before opening the panel. Available on these dates: Preview release: November 4, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience

  </tr> Improved proofing capabilities for reviewers and requestors To provide a more integrated experience between Workfront and Proof, we’ve made several improvements regarding proofing capabilities for Reviewers and Requestors: You can grant Moderator or Author roles to any user in Workfront, regardless of whether they have a Proofing license, giving them additional rights, like applying actions or resolving comments. You can add Reviewers and Requestors to proofs that require a login or that need to be electronically signed. All users also benefit from improved connectivity between Workfront and Proof. Now, when deactivating a user or updating a user’s email address, your updates are correctly reflected in proofing when changed in Workfront. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 (Available only for EMEA customers with integrated proofing; available for all remaining customers on January 17, 2022) Production release: December 21, 2021 (Available only for EMEA customers with integrated proofing; available for all remaining customers February 3, 2022) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Electronic Signature Enhancements for proofs We’ve made it easier for users to sign proofs electronically. Now, users can use their Workfront credentials to sign a decision on a proof. To electronically sign a proof with SSO credentials, you must set SSO up in Workfront Proof. Previously, users had to use Workfront Proof credentials, which are different from their Workfront credentials. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 (Available for both EMEA and U.S. customers) Production release: TBD (Available for customers in EMEA on December 21, 2021; available for all remaining customers on February 3, 2022) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic (Workfront Classic will be discontinued in March 2022, followed shortly by the end-of-life date for Workfront Classic in July 2022.) Desktop Viewer Upgrade We’ve upgraded the Desktop Proofing Viewer to support up to Chrome version 91 for greater compatibility with interactive proofs. Windows users must manually reinstall the desktop viewer to upgrade to the latest version. After that, future updates to the Desktop Proofing Viewer will be automatic. Mac users will be upgraded to the latest version automatically.

Prior to these enhancements, you could group your items only by Planned Completion Date as well as by Commit date. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Add the My Updates area for all licensed users As part of our efforts to create parity between Workfront Classic and the new Workfront experience, we have reintroduced the My Updates area for all users. As a result of this update, Review users can find this area as their default landing page, unless they are assigned to a layout template. A Workfront or Group administrator can add this area to all users’ Main Menu and Top navigation by using a layout template. When you open the My Updates area, you can now quickly find the following information: Approvals waiting for your decision display in the first half of the My Updates page. You can approve, reject, suggest changes, grant access, or delegate your approvals to others. Comments in which you have been included display in the lower half of the My Updates page, in the Mentions section. Available on these dates: Preview release: December 2, 2021 Production release: With the 22.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Improvements to timesheets To improve the experience of everyone who manages time in Workfront, we are introducing various updates to timesheets. Some of these updates include: When a user has a current timesheet, the Timesheets area now opens to that current timesheet saving time for searching and clicking into a current timesheet. When there are no current timesheets, the Timesheets area still displays the My Timesheets section, as it does today. The row you hover over or you click into to enter time is highlighted to increase visibility. The footer that contains the timesheet buttons is now sticky so that you always have access to save and cancel without scrolling to the bottom of the page. We also added a new Back to top button in this area to quickly return to the top of the page. A new warning notification now alerts you of unsaved changes to prevent you from losing information when navigating away from the timesheet.

The new menu provides the same information, but with fewer levels of navigation, requiring fewer clicks to see relevant content.

<!--
Functionality being removed from Production Feature rollback: Carry over the existing proof workflow when generating a new version Due to customer feedback, Workfront is removing this change from Preview environments on March 30, 2021 and from Production environments on March 31, 2021. On March 11, 2021, Workfront released a change to existing proof workflows in both Workfront Classic and the new Workfront experience. The change allowed for an existing workflow to carry over to any new proof versions created by a user, regardless of the method used to generate them. In the new Workfront experience after this change is removed, proofs created with the Simple proof selection will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation. In Workfront Classic after this change is removed, the option to Generate Proof will not include any preset proofing settings, and new versions will not carry over existing workflows or proof settings. A user can adjust settings after proof generation. Similar functionality to easily copy existing workflows might be added to Production at a future time.
