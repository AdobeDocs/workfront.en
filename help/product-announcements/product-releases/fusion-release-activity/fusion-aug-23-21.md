## Typeahead fields now available in Workfront modules

To make modules easier to use, replaced some dropdown lists with typeahead fields. Now, instead of selecting items from long lists, you can begin typing the item, then click it when it appears.

Previously, users selected items from dropdown lists. Depending on the object, these lists could be long, and it could be inconvenient to scroll and locate items.

For more information on Workfront modules, see [Adobe Workfront modules](../../../workfront-fusion/apps-and-their-modules/workfront-modules.md).

## Billing record object now available in Workfront modules

The Billing record object is available in drop-down object selection lists in the following modules:

* Watch Record
* Delete Record
* Create Record
* Read Record
* Update Record
* Search Record

Previously, the billing record object was only available through mapping.
