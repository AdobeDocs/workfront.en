## Typeahead fields now available in Workfront modules {#typeahead-fields-now-available-in-workfront-modules}

To make modules easier to use, replaced some dropdown lists with typeahead fields. Now, instead of selecting items from long lists, you can begin typing the item, then click it when it appears. 


Previously, users selected items from dropdown lists. Depending on the object, these lists could be long, and it could be inconvenient to scroll and locate items.
