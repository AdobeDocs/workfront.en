## Teams now share email notification settings {#teams-now-share-email-notification-settings}

We've changed email notifications to be set by team, rather than by user. Now you can ensure that every member of the team gets the same information.


Previously, users set their own email notification settings.


>[!NOTE]
>
>Fusion applies organization notification settings to the team level for each team in the organization. To ensure that your teams are taking advantage of the new notification capability, update the email notification settings at the team level.
