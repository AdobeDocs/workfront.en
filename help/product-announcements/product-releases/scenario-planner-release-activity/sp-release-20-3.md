# *Workfront Scenario Planner* with the 20.3 release - August 14, 2020

*Workfront Scenario Planner* is available with the 20.3 release to Production only with *the new Adobe Workfront experience*.

With *Scenario Planner*, create and compare multiple what-if scenarios to choose the best path forward. And when your priorities change, iteratively re-plan without impacting in-progress work.

*Scenario Planner* enables you to:

* Create and compare *Scenarios*

  Easily create and view different scenarios side-by-side with minimal data required from you.

* Highlight resource bottlenecks

  See where you’ve already committed people or budget to existing or planned work.

* Determine a path forward

  Create and compare scenarios, facilitate collaboration and consensus, execute, and then re-plan when necessary.

*Scenario Planner* helps you be more agile in your planning. Whether you own the strategic plan for your company or you’re conducting quarterly planning for a single business unit, department, or team, Scenario Planner can help. Quickly and easily create and compare multiple scenarios based on constraints, such as budgets or team resources.

With *Scenario Planner*, you can model scenarios by objective or initiative in Scenario Planner to answer questions such as:

* If we’re optimizing for growth vs. profitability, what are the differences in investment scenarios?
* To hit a growth optimization target, do we need additional resources within a specific skill set?
* To hit a profitability target, do we need to push specific initiatives out to a later date
