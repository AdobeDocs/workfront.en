  </tr> Introduce new Access Level setting for copying projects To give you more control, as a system administrator, to what Planners can do with a project, we have made the Edit access to projects in the access level more granular, by introducing a new setting that allows you to enable or disable their ability to copy projects. Prior to this change, when you enabled users’ access to Edit projects, they automatically had access to copy them. With the new feature, you can give someone access to edit projects without necessarily having access to copy them by disabling the new Copy setting. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: January 13, 2021 Production release: With the 21.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic In a Custom Form on an object, select all items in a multi-select drop-down field On the Details page for an object, when you are filling in a multi-select drop-down field on a Custom Form, you can click Select All if you need to select all of the available options. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: January 13, 2021 Production release: With the 21.1 release (Not currently available when you are submitting a new Request.) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Recalculate all Custom Form fields for an object Now it’s easier to ensure that all data in calculated custom fields is current for an object. A new Recalculate Expressions menu option lets you quickly recalculate all data in these fields. This is especially useful after someone edits data in another object that is referenced by a calculated custom field in your object. Previously, users had to use workarounds to ensure that all data in calculated custom fields was current. For example, they edited the object along with other objects to use the recalculation option that is available for bulk editing. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: December 10, 2020 Production release: With the 21.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Unlock task and issue preferences for Group Administrators Workfront administrators can now give Group Administrators more autonomy by unlocking individual task and issue preferences. When a preference is unlocked, Group Administrators can configure it for their groups to serve each group’s unique needs and internal processes. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: December 2, 2020 Production release: With the 21.1 release (Before June 24, 2021, this was available as part of a phased rollout only for customers on Cluster 4 and 6 and a few other customers. Now it is available in Production for all customers.) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Configure access level settings for portfolios and programs separately Now it’s easier to manage user access to portfolios and programs because you can configure their access level settings separately. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: December 2, 2020 Production release: With the 21.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic Select all checkboxes in a series when editing information in a Custom Form On the Details page for an object, when you are filling in a Custom Form field containing checkboxes, you can click Select All if you need to select all of the checkboxes available. This option displays only if the field contains more than 2 checkboxes. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: December 2, 2020 Production release: With the 21.1 release (Not currently available when submitting a request.) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Configure your Workfront email allowlist To better secure your data, you can now use an email domain allowlist to: Control where Workfront emails can go if they contain reports or documents stored in Workfront Control email domains can be in the email address that users can specify in their user profile For example, if you want to protect sensitive data, such as a report listing your at-risk customers, you can include only your internal email domain or domains in the email allowlist. That way, users cannot send that report (or any other Workfront report) to an external email address. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: November 20, 2020 Production release: With the 21.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic Assign a Group Administrator for a subgroup To make it easier for the levels of your organization to operate independently, we have added the ability to assign a Group Administrator to a subgroup. Now you can make sure you are delegating subgroup management to the right people. Previously, only a top-level group could have Group Administrators, and those administrators managed all of the subgroups beneath the top-level group. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: November 20, 2020 Production release: With the 21.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic Work with group projects and approval processes in the Groups area If you are a Group Administrator, it’s easy to view and work with your group’s projects and approval processes now that they are listed in the Groups area. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: November 20, 2020 Production release: With the 21.1 release Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Configure event notifications for groups New in Preview! Workfront administrators can now give Group Administrators more autonomy by allowing them to configure event notifications for their top-level groups. Subgroups inherit event notification configurations from their top parent group. Previously, event notifications were configurable only by a Workfront administrator at the system level, which means that all groups had to use the same set of event notifications. Available on these dates: Beta Preview release: January 22, 2021 Production release: With the 21.1 release (Available initially in Production only to customers on Cluster 4 as part of a phased rollout; available for other clusters shortly thereafter) Available in these environments: The new Adobe Workfront experience Adobe Workfront Classic View the number of licenses used and allocated in a group To determine how well your licenses are distributed, you can now view the number of licenses that are used in a group and any subgroups below it. If you manage a top-level group, you can view both the number of licenses that are used in a group (and its subgroups) and the maximum number of licenses allocated for the group.
