## Restrict hour editing on timesheets {#restrict-hour-editing-on-timesheets}

To provide more control over timesheets and hour editing, we've added a setting that allows you to restrict hour editing to timesheet owners and system administrators.


Previously, users with the Timesheets & Hours option enabled in their access level could edit hours on any timesheet.


For more information, see [Configure timesheet and hour preferences](timesheet-and-hour-preferences.md).


## For Workfront administrators:&nbsp;Configure event notifications for groups {#for-workfront-administrators-configure-event-notifications-for-groups}

Workfront administrators can now give Group Administrators more autonomy by allowing them to configure event notifications for their top-level groups. Subgroups inherit event notification configurations from their top parent group.


Previously, event notifications were configurable only by a Workfront administrator at the system level, which means that all groups had to use the same set of event notifications.


For more information, see the following articles:



*  [Unlock or re-lock configuration of event notifications for groups](unlock-configuration-of-event-notifications-for-groups.md) 
*  [View and configure event notifications for a group](view-and-configure-event-notifications-group.md)
