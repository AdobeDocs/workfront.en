## Expand or collapse items in the breadcrumb navigation

To allow easier viewing of the full breadcrumb path, we've added expand and collapse functionality.

Now, any truncated items are grouped before the Project with the text "more". For example, "3 more" indicates that there are 3 objects that aren't displaying.

Previously, you had to click the ellipsis to display any truncated objects in a drop-down menu.

To view all items in the breadcrumb, click "more" at the beginning of the breadcrumb to expand the items. Once expanded, you can click "Less" to collapse the items again.
