This page describes all *Requests* enhancements made with the *21.3* release to the Preview environment. These enhancements were made available in the Production environment the week of July 21, 2021.

For a list of all changes available with the *21.3* release, see [21.3 Release overview](../../../product-announcements/product-releases/21.3-release-activity/21-3-release-overview.md).

## Find requests by recent paths or by searching using a keyword

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available only in *the new Adobe Workfront experience*.

To help you find the right request queue faster by referring to recently logged requests, we have introduced the following improvements to finding a recently used queue:

* A list of the recent paths for which you have entered requests
* The ability to search for a request type by any keyword included in a path.

A path includes the request queue and all the topic groups and queue topics that you have selected before when submitting a request.

For more information, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](create-submit-requests.md).
