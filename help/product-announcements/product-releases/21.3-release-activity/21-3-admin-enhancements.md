This feature is now included in the [Project templates in the new Workfront experience](https://one.workfront.com/s/learningpath4/project-templates-in-the-new-workfront-experience-MCGLS7GRNLDZDFPF6AEOGIDZFDG4) learning path on Workfront One.


## New for group administrators: Create and manage statuses for a group at any level {#new-for-group-administrators-create-and-manage-statuses-for-a-group-at-any-level}

To make it easier for all levels of an organization to manage and control their workflows independently, weâ€™ve introduced the ability to create and manage statuses for subgroups. Now, from the Groups section in Setup, you can do the following for groups you administer on any level:



*  Create, edit, delete, and hide a status for a group
*  Lock a status for any group so that all lower subgroups below it can use it in the same way
*  Unlock a status for any group so that administrators of lower subgroups can customize it to meet their unique needs
*  Set a group status as a default status
*  Reorder and hide the display of group statuses on objects


Workfront administrators can also do these things (for all groups).


Previously, this functionality was available only for top-level groups.


For more information, see [Manage group statuses](_manage-group-statuses.md).

## New for administrators: Create a billing record custom form {#new-for-administrators-create-a-billing-record-custom-form}

Now you can improve how users capture billing information by creating a billing record custom form. Users can attach the custom form to a billing record, fill it out, and run reports that include the information in the form.


For information about creating custom forms, see [Create or edit a custom form](create-or-edit-a-custom-form.md).


For information about attaching a billing record custom form to a project, see [Add a custom form to an object](add-a-custom-form-to-an-object.md).
