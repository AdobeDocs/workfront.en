Starting on July 15, 2020 the new *Adobe Workfront* API and developer documentation site officially launches for open beta testing.

## Work in progress

The Core Workfront API is vast and complex. Our team is working hard to build a new platform for documentation while at the same time documenting objects, endpoints, and processes. There will be constant updates and improvements during the beta with the expectation of having most major functions and features available by the end of 2020.

## What's new?

Some of the main features included with the new developer documentation site are:

* The new Developer and Core API documentation site is currently set up to work in tandem with our other API resources, such as the Legacy [API Explorer](../../wf-api/general/api-explorer.md). Ultimately, we hope to integrate many of the features that these two separate tools provide into one useful resource. 
* The most important difference between the existing and the new developer documentation sites is that the new site is based on the industry standard OpenAPI&nbsp;spec. This allows you to quickly obtain relevant information about objects and endpoints that is not readily apparent in our other Core API documentation resources. 
* The new documentation site also affords you a level of search that doesn't exist in the legacy documentation, such as the ability to search for UI features, names, descriptions, and so forth. without having to know their exact API reference. And because of the inherent layout of the OpenAPI&nbsp;spec documentation, it's easy to quickly decipher what an object or endpoint might be used for, even if you're not immediately familiar with it.

For the time being, the Legacy API&nbsp;Explorer is still the best way to understand the relationships between different objects, their parameters, and the relationships that they share between other objects.

## What's next?

The three main features that are in queue for 2020 are:

* Examples
* Sandbox and call testing
* Integration with the Legacy API Explorer relational information

## Ongoing projects

Aside from the major features planned for 2020, we will continue to update object and endpoint descriptions to make them more relevant, easier to understand, and more search friendly. We also plan to incorporate more articles about Core API processes, rules, and common use cases. And, of course, we'll be working to evaluate and integrate the feedback that we receive during the beta process.
