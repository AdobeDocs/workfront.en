### Filter the search results page {#filter-the-search-results-page}

After you type your search and press Enter, an improved search results page displays.


One new improvement is a new filtering area in the lower-left corner that allows you to apply helpful filters to the product documentation.


For example, has your organization moved over to the new Workfront experience and you no longer want to see Workfront Classic documentation? Simply select “The new Workfront experience” to view only the articles that apply to you.

1.  Enable any options that you want to see prioritized in your search results. 


   For example, if you enable `Workfront Classic`in the `Version`section, the main link of each search result will display articles for Workfront Classic, and users will have to click the subordinate link of each result to view documentation for the new Workfront experience.


   Your changes are saved automatically.
