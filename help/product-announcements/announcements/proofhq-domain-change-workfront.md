# Change required for adding proofs to your allowlist {#change-required-for-adding-proofs-to-your-allowlist}

The proofing domain is changing from&nbsp;proofhq.com to workfront.com. 


If your firewall or mail server is configured to allow access only to specific vendors, you must add the following additional URL to your allowlist to ensure that users in your organization can view proofs within *`Adobe Workfront`* in both the browser proofing viewer and the desktop proofing viewer:


&#42;.workfront.com


The &#42;proofhq.com URL is also still required.


For more information about updating your allowlist, see [Configure your firewall](configure-your-firewall.md).


>[!NOTE]
>
>This update applies only to proofing within Workfront; it does not apply when using the Workfront Proof stand-alone application.
