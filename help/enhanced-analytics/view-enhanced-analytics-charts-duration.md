# View `Enhanced analytics` charts by duration {#view-enhanced-analytics-charts-by-duration}

The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.


If your teams do not use Planned Hours, you can look at data for projects based on duration, which shows you the time spent on projects based on the amount of days planned to complete a project (Planned Duration) and the actual amount of days it took to complete a project (Actual Duration).


For more information, see [Overview of project Duration](project-duration.md).


You can select a duration view for the following charts:



* Burndown chart  
  To learn more about the Burndown chart, see [Burndown overview for Enhanced analytics](burndown-overview.md).

* Project treemap chart  
  To learn more about the Project treemap chart, see [Project treemap overview](project-treemap-overview.md).
