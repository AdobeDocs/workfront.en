# Review Requested Projects

When multiple project requests are submitted for review, the project management office or portfolio committee can meet to review submitted requests and determine project request approvals. To submit a project request for review, do one of the following:

* Change the project status to `Requested`.
* Complete the Business Case of the project and submit it for approval.   
  For more information about completing a Business Case for a project, see [Create a Business Case for a project in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

You can review requested projects in the following areas of `Adobe Workfront`:

* In a project report
* Within a portfolio

## Review Requested Projects in a project report

You can build a report for projects to see what projects have a status of Requested.
