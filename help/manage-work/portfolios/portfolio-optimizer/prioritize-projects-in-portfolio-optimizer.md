# Prioritize projects in the Portfolio Optimizer

You can prioritize your projects in the Portfolio Optimizer, to establish the order in which they should be completed.

Consider the following when using the Portfolio Optimizer:

* The projects at the top of the Portfolio Optimizer are considered more important than the ones listed towards the bottom. You will need to complete the projects in order of their priority in the Portfolio Optimizer for the Portfolio to be optimized.&nbsp;
* The priority of projects in the Portfolio Optimizer is unrelated to the Priority field located on the Project Details tab of a project.

  The Priority field on the Project Details tab is a visual flag that you manually specify to understand how important a project should be. 

* The priority of projects in the Portfolio Optimizer is visible in the Resource Planner, if it is enabled there. In the Resource Planner, projects receive resources in the order of their Resource Planner priority, and not that of the Portfolio Priority.

  For information about prioritizing projects in the Resource Planner, see the article [Prioritize projects in the Resource Planner](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/prioritize-projects-resource-planner.md). 

* The `Project Prioritization` area of the Portfolio Optimizer displays projects in the order of Planned Start Dates and Net Value, by default.
