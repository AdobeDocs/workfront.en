# Create requests from drafts

In addition to using the available drafts that Workfront suggests to you when you enter a new request, you can also access a draft request from the Drafts section and finish submitting it from there.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront license*</td> 
   <td> <p>Request or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your Workfront administrator if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a Workfront administrator can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your Workfront administrator.

## Prerequisites for creating requests from drafts

You must do the following before you can create a request from a draft:&nbsp;

* Start creating a request. This saves the request as a draft automatically in the Drafts section.

  For information about creating requests, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).

## Create requests from drafts

<ol> 
 <li value="1"> Click the Main Menu icon in the upper-right corner of Workfront. </li> 
 <li value="2"> Click Requests > Drafts. <p>A draft for each queue topic of each request queue displays in this list. </p>  </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Review the information about each draft in the following columns of the Drafts list:</p> 
  <table cellspacing="0"> 
   <col> 
   <col> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Subject</td> 
     <td>This is the name you gave your request as you started to create it. </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Path</td> 
     <td>The name of the request queue, topic groups, and queue topics where you originally intended to submit the request.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Entry Date</td> 
     <td>The date when you initiated creating the request.</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td role="rowheader">Last Update Date</td> 
     <td>The last of your last update. If you did not update it since you first started the request the&nbsp;Entry Date and the Last Update Date should be the same. </td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table> </li> 
 <li value="4">(Optional) Click <span class="bold">Filter by request type</span> in the upper-right corner of the list of drafts, then select the request queue that contains the drafts you want to display. </li> 
 <li value="5">Click the name of a draft to open it. </li> 
 <li value="6"> <p>Update the information for the request as described in <a href="../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md" class="MCXref xref">Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests</a>.</p> </li> 
 <li value="7">(Optional and conditional)&nbsp;At any point during entering the request, click&nbsp;<span class="bold">Discard</span> draft if you want to delete the draft. This deletes the draft which cannot be recovered.

  <ul> 
   <li> <p>Click Submit if you are ready to submit the request. The request is saved in the Submitted section. Depending on the Routing Rule of the Request Queue, this request might be routed to a different project than the one designated&nbsp;as a Request Queue.

Your request is saved in the Drafts section and it will be available to you next time you submit a request for this request queue. </p>  <p>When you submit the request, the draft is deleted and cannot be restored. </p> </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ol>
