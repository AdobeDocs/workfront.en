# Create requests from drafts {#create-requests-from-drafts}

In addition to using the available drafts that *`Workfront`* suggests to you when you enter a new request, you can also access a draft request from the Drafts `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> section </MadCap:conditionalText>`and finish submitting it from there. 


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:
