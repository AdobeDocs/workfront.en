# Delete a request draft

You can delete request drafts as you are creating them, by discarding them.

For information see:

* [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md) 
* [Create requests from drafts](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-requests-from-drafts.md)

You can delete drafted requests after they are saved as drafts if you no longer find them relevant. You cannot recover deleted draft requests.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Request</em> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <em>Workfront administrator</em> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <em>Workfront administrator</em> can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.

## Prerequisites for deleting request drafts

You must do the following before you can delete&nbsp;a request draft:

* Start creating a request. This saves the request as a draft automatically in the Drafts 

  <!--
  <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver">
  section
  </MadCap:conditionalText>
  -->

  `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> section </MadCap:conditionalText>`.

  For information about creating requests, see [Create and submit Adobe Workfront requests](../../../manage-work/requests/create-requests/create-submit-requests.md).
