## Locate submitted requests

<!--
Locate submitted requests in Production To locate requests that you or other users have submitted in the Production environment: Go to the Requests area in the Global Navigation Bar. Click the Main Menu icon in the upper-right corner of Adobe Workfront. Click Requests I've Submitted in the left panel to view all the requests that you have submitted. Or Click All Requests to view all requests that other users have submitted and which you have permissions to at least View. You can display up to 100 requests in the Requests I've Submitted and All Requests sections. Requests that are pending approval do not display. Click the Open subtab to view requests that are open. Requests without an Actual Completion Date or whose resolving object does not have an Actual Completion Date are listed in the Open subtab. Click the Complete subtab to view requests that have been completed. Requests with an Actual Completion Date or whose resolving object has an Actual Completion Date are listed in the Complete subtab. Once a request receives an Actual Completion Date, it stays in the Recently Completed area for 10 business days. After that, it is moved to the Completed area. For information about resolving and resolvable objects, see the article Overview of Resolving and Resolvable Objects . (Optional) Select an option from the Sort by drop-down menu to sort the requests by the following criteria: Assigned To: Requests are sorted alphabetically by the name of the assignee using the following criteria: All requests assigned to users are sorted first, in the order of the users' names. Requests assigned to job roles are sorted secondly, in the order of the job roles' names and are listed after all the requests assigned to users. Requests that are assigned to teams are sorted last, in the order of the teams' names and are listed after all the requests assigned to users and those assigned to job roles. All unassigned requests are listed last, in the order of their Entry Date. Submitted On: Requests are sorted chronologically by the date when they were submitted. Recently Updated (this is the default): Requests are sorted chronologically by the date of their last update. Name: Requests are sorted alphabetically by name. Priority: Requests are sorted in the order of their priority. Queue: Requests are sorted alphabetically by the name of the requests queue where they were submitted. Status: Requests are sorted alphabetically by their status. Click Draft Requests to view all drafted requests. Workfront saves an unlimited number of drafts for each request queue in this folder. When you enter a new request for a queue topic that already has a draft, you will be prompted to use an existing draft. For more information about drafted requests, see the Locate submitted requests section in this article.
