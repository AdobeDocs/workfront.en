# Overview of the project Actual Completion Date

Projects, tasks, and issues have an&nbsp;Actual&nbsp;Completion&nbsp;Date in *Adobe Workfront*. This is the date when the project, task, or issue were marked as completed.

## Actual&nbsp;Completion&nbsp;Dates

The Actual Completion Date represents the real date and time when the work is completed. When an item is marked as Done or Complete *Workfront* automatically sets the Actual Completion Date as the date of the change in status of the item. If that date is not an accurate reflection of when the item was actually completed, then you&nbsp;can edit the Actual Completion Date.

The Actual Completion&nbsp;Date of a project is set in the following ways:

* Manually, if the Completion Mode of the Project is set to Manual and you manually change the status of the project
* Automatically, when the last task or issue of the project completes, if the Completion&nbsp;Mode of the Project is set to Automatic.

  For information about setting the Completion&nbsp;Mode of a project, see the article [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The *Workfront administrator* or a *group administrator* determines whether *Workfront* uses today's date or the Planned Completion Date of a task or an issue when these are set to Complete or Closed. For information about setting task and issue preferences, see [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-task-issue-preferences.md).

The value for the Actual Completion Date is always what is considered the current date and time.

>[!NOTE]
>
>&nbsp;The latest Actual Completion Date from a project's tasks will be used as the Actual Completion Date for the entire project.

## Locate Actual&nbsp;Completion&nbsp;Dates

The Actual Completion Date is located within the following areas of *Workfront*:

* Project, Task, and Issue Details areas
* Edit Project,&nbsp;Task, and Issue boxes
* Project, Task, and Issue Updates area as a System Update.

You can also display the Actual&nbsp;Completion Date of projects, tasks, or issues, in a report.

For more information about creating reports, see the article [Create a custom report](../../../reports-and-dashboards/reports/creating-and-managing-reports/create-custom-report.md).
