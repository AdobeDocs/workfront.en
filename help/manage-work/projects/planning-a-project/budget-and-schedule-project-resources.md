# Budget and schedule project resources

When planning a project, ensure that you

* Budget your resources (users and job roles) to your projects as described in the article [Resource Planning in Adobe Workfront](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-planning/resource-planning-overview.md). When you budget resources you estimate, at a high level, when and for how long those resources will be used on projects. 
* Schedule your resources to tasks and issues as described in&nbsp;the article [Resource Scheduling](../../../resource-mgmt/resource-scheduling/resource-scheduling-overview.md). When you schedule your resources for tasks and issues you can allocate hours to and assign your resources to specific tasks and issues.
