# Overview of the project Planned Start Date  {#overview-of-the-project-planned-start-date}

The Planned Start and the Planned Completion Dates of a project rely on the dates of the tasks on the project.&nbsp;This article describes the Planned Start Date of a project. For information about the task Planned Start Date, see [Overview of the task Planned Start Date](task-planned-start-date.md).


The Planned Start Date of a project can be set manually or automatically, depending on whether you schedule the project from the Start or from the Completion Date.&nbsp;


## Manually set the Planned Start Date of a project {#manually-set-the-planned-start-date-of-a-project}

You must manually set the Planned Start Date of a project when you schedule the project from Start Date.&nbsp;


For information about setting the project's Planned Start Date, see [Edit projects](edit-projects.md). 


## Automatically set the Planned Start Date of a project {#automatically-set-the-planned-start-date-of-a-project}

The Planned Start Date of a project is automatically set when you create the project in the following ways:



*  from scratch and when you schedule the project from Completion Date.&nbsp;


  The Planned Start Date is automatically calculated by *`Adobe Workfront`*, based on the date you select for the Completion Date and the durations of all the tasks on the project. 


  For information about creating a project from scratch, see [Create a project](create-project.md). 

*  import it from&nbsp;Microsoft Project.


  The Planned Start&nbsp;Date is the Start&nbsp;Date of the project in Microsoft Project. 


  For information about importing a project from&nbsp;Microsoft Project, see [Import a project from Microsoft Project](import-project-from-ms-project.md).

*  import it using *`Workfront`* Kick-Starts, when you are a *`Workfront administrator`*.


  The Planned Start&nbsp;Date always matches your computer's time and date, unless you specify otherwise in the setPlannedStartDate field on the Project sheet of the kick-start file. 


  For information about importing data using kick-starts, see [Import data into Adobe Workfront via a Kick-Start template](import-data-via-kickstarts.md).


  For information about importing projects using kick-starts, see [Kick-Starts scenario: simple project and task import preparation](kick-starts-scenario-simple-project-task-import-prep.md). 





## The Planned Start Date of a task {#the-planned-start-date-of-a-task}

You can either specify the Planned Start Date of a task, or you can leave it up to *`Workfront`* to calculate it depending on certain criteria.&nbsp;


For information about the Planned Start&nbsp;Date of a task, see [Overview of the task Planned Start Date](task-planned-start-date.md).
