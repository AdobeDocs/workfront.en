# Create and edit risks on projects

Risks are possible events or factors that prevent a project from finishing on time or within budget. Risks can be recorded as part of creating the Business Case of a project or by using the Risks tab. Risks are created only on a project. You cannot associate risks with tasks or issues.

Risks can be associated with cost, but Actual Risk Cost does not impact the Actual Cost of the Project.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This article defines the risks associated with the project as you define them in the Business Case of the project or as you add them in the Risks tab of the project. For information about the Risk field that is available when editing a project, see [Edit projects](../../../manage-work/projects/manage-projects/edit-projects.md).

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><em>Adobe Workfront</em> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><em>Plan</em> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Projects and Financial&nbsp;Data</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <em>Workfront administrator</em> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <em>Workfront administrator</em> can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p> Manage permissions that include Manage Finance on the project for which you want to create or edit risks </p> <p>For more information about project permissions, see the article <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-project.md" class="MCXref xref">Share a project in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your *Workfront administrator*.

## Create and edit risks in the Business Case

You can create risks as part of planning the Business Case of a project. You can later edit them in the Business Case, when changes occur to their probability, mitigation plan, or cost, for example. For information about creating a Business Case, see [Create a Business Case for a project in Adobe Workfront](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

Your *Workfront administrator* `or *group administrator*` must enable the `Risks` section in your Business Case in the Project Preferences area before you can view it at the project level in the Business Case section. For information about setting project preferences, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

Creating and editing risks in the Business Case is identical.

To create or edit a risk in the Business Case:

</ol>

## Create and edit risks in the Risks area

In addition to creating and editing risks in the Business Case, you can do so using the `Risks`

</MadCap:conditionalText>
-->

`<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> section</MadCap:conditionalText>`of a project.

You can edit risks during the life of a project, when changes occur in their probability, potential cost, or their status, for example.

You can edit one risk at a time, or you can edit multiple risks in bulk.
