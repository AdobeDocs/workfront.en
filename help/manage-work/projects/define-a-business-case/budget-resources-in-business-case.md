# Budget resources in the Business Case  {#budget-resources-in-the-business-case}

The information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

As part of resource planning, you can budget the job roles necessary for completing the work in a project when you build the business case. For more information about creating a Business Case, see [Create a Business Case for a project in Adobe Workfront](create-business-case.md). 


>[!NOTE]
>
>Budgeting resources is not the same as scheduling resources for a project. When you budget resources you estimate the roles that might be necessary to complete the work on a project. For actually scheduling or assigning users to the work on a project, see [Get started with Resource Scheduling](get-started-resource-scheduling.md). For information about resource planning in *`Adobe Workfront`*, see [Get started with Resource Planning](get-started-resource-planning.md). 


You must associate job roles with the project before you can budget the resources for it. The following are ways of allocating job roles to a project:



*  Use the *`Resource Planner`* to apply Resource Pools to the project and budget job roles. 


  For more information, see [Budget resources in the Business Case using the Adobe Workfront Resource Planner](budget-resources-in-business-case-use-resource-planner.md). 

*  Use the *`Scenario Planner`* to create initiatives with required job roles and link them to the project. For more information, see [Budget resources in the Business Case using the Adobe Workfront Scenario Planner](budget-resources-in-business-case-use-scenario-planner.md).
