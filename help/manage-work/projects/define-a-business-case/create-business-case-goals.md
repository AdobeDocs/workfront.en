# Create Business Case goals  {#create-business-case-goals}

As part of creating a Business Case, you can create a set of goals to define the objectives of a project. Business Case goals are used to communicate to the Portfolio Manager or the Project Sponsor the purpose of completing a project. 


>[!TIP] {type="tip"}
>
>You can create strategic goals for your organization that are not connected to a project's individual Business Case. You must have access to  *`Adobe Workfront Goals`* to be able to create strategic goals. You can then connect them with projects outside of their Business Cases. For information about creating goals using *`Workfront Goals`*, see [Adobe Workfront Goals overview](wf-goals-overview.md). 


Consider the following when creating Business Case goals for your projects: 



* Business Case goals are project-specific. You cannot copy goals from one project to another, nor establish goals at the system level. They must be defined at the level of each project. 
* Your *`Adobe Workfront administrator`* `or *`group administrator`*` must enable the Goals section for your projects before it displays in the Business Case of your projects. For information about enabling Business Case fields for projects, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](set-project-preferences.md).

*   Goals are not a mandatory section in the Business Case of a project.


  A project can receive a score to be prioritized in the Portfolio Optimizer, even if the Goals section of the Business Case is not defined.


  For more information about the Portfolio Optimizer score, see [Apply a scorecard to a project and generate an Alignment Score](apply-scorecard-to-project-to-generate-alignment-score.md).

*   You cannot report on Business&nbsp;Case&nbsp;goals.
