# Create Business Case goals

As part of creating a Business Case, you can create a set of goals to define the objectives of a project. Business Case goals are used to communicate to the Portfolio Manager or the Project Sponsor the purpose of completing a project.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can create strategic goals for your organization that are not connected to a project's individual Business Case. You must have access to&nbsp;*Adobe Workfront Goals* to be able to create strategic goals. You can then connect them with projects outside of their Business Cases. For information about creating goals using *Workfront Goals*, see [Adobe Workfront Goals overview](../../../workfront-goals/goal-management/wf-goals-overview.md).

Consider the following when creating Business Case goals for your projects:

* Business Case goals are project-specific. You cannot copy goals from one project to another, nor establish goals at the system level. They must be defined at the level of each project. 
* Your *Adobe Workfront administrator* `or *group administrator*` must enable the Goals section for your projects before it displays in the Business Case of your projects. For information about enabling Business Case fields for projects, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md).

* Goals are not a mandatory section in the Business Case of a project.

  A project can receive a score to be prioritized in the Portfolio Optimizer, even if the Goals section of the Business Case is not defined.

  For more information about the Portfolio Optimizer score, see [Apply a scorecard to a project and generate an Alignment Score](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/apply-scorecard-to-project-to-generate-alignment-score.md).

* You cannot report on Business&nbsp;Case&nbsp;goals.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:
