Overview of the Finance area 

Consider the following when viewing or editing information in the Finance area:

* The financial information you can find on the Finance area of Project Detailsrepresents values that roll up to the project level from tasks, as well as information entered directly on the project. Some financial information can be managed at the project as well as the task level. 
* You must have View permissions on the project as well as access to Financial Data from your access level in order to be able to view the Finance areaon a project. 
* You must have Manage permissions on the project as well as access to Financial Data from your access level in order to be able to edit the information on the Finance area. However, we recommend that only the Project Owner should edit the information on this area.
