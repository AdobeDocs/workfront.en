In the *`Metrics`* area, you can see the overall health of a project, as well as:



* Where work is active or stalled
* Who has open work items assigned to them
* Details on tasks or issues that are overdue or close to the Planned Completion Date  


You can also drill in to each chart to look more closely at tasks or issues in a specific category.


To learn more about looking at these tasks or issues, see [View Metrics details](#view).

## Task or issue bar chart {#task-or-issue-bar-chart}

In the bar chart that appears below the project KPIs, you can look at the status or priority of work items in the project. The task view is selected by default.


When status is selected in this chart, you can view all statuses of tasks or issues in a project. Each status is grouped into a bar in the chart. All default system statuses and custom statuses display in this chart.
