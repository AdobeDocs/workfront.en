# Schedule resources for a project

You can schedule resources for a single project to indicate what work each resource is assigned to as well as how much time they should spend completing their work. You can schedule resources for a project and allocate hours to each resource using the Scheduling tool or the `Workload Balancer` at the project level.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Plan</span> </p> </td>
