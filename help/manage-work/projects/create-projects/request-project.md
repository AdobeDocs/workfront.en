# Request a project

You can request a project for approval before you start working on it. This creates a project with a status of&nbsp;Idea. We recommend building a Business Case for your project to outline some of the key points you want to achieve by completing it, as well as to present to your management your labor and expense budget.

You can request a project when you add a new project in the following areas of `Adobe Workfront`:

* In the Projects area 
* In the Projects area of a Portfolio
* In the Projects area of a Program
* In the Groups area for the group of the project, when you are a `group administrator`.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"> <p role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</p> </td> 
   <td> <p><span>Plan</span> </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to Projects</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information about access to projects, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/grant-access-projects.md" class="MCXref xref">Grant access to projects</a>. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can change your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>When you create a project request you automatically receive Manage permissions to the project </p> <p> For information about project permissions, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/share-a-project.md" class="MCXref xref">Share a project in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Request a project

1. Do one of the following:

  * Click the Main Menu, click Projects, then expand New Project. 
  * Go to a portfolio, then expand New Project. 
  * Go to a program, then expand New Project.

1. Click  `Request Project`. 
1. Do one of the following:

  * Follow the same steps as for creating a project while defining a Business Case. (recommended)

    For information about defining a Business Case and requesting a project, see [Creating a Business Case](../../../manage-work/projects/define-a-business-case/create-business-case.md).

  * Create a project from scratch or using a template and change the status to  `Requested`.

    For information about creating a project, see [Creating a Project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project.md) or [Creating a Project Using a Template](../../../manage-work/projects/create-projects/create-project-from-template.md).

   The project you request has a status of  `Requested` and it displays on the `Requested Projects` tab of a Portfolio, if you associated it with a Portfolio. A portfolio manager can now review it and either approve it or reject it, in which case the status of the project changes to either `Approved` or `Rejected`.
