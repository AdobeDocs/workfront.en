# Create a project using a template

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.

You can use templates as a framework to create new projects. If you have projects that repeat often, using templates for the general timeline of the new project saves you from having to build the same projects repeatedly.

Templates provide you with a way to capture all of the repeatable processes, information, and settings associated with your projects. All of the information associated with a template is transferred to the project. This includes tasks, assignments, durations, documents, financial details, risks, and custom forms.

>[!TIP]
>
>The status of a new project created from a template corresponds with the status defined by your Workfront administrator in the main Project Preferences area or by a group administrator `(or Workfront administrator) in the Project Preferences area for a group.` For information about configuring project preferences, see [Configure system-wide project preferences](../../../administration-and-setup/set-up-workfront/configure-system-defaults/set-project-preferences.md) or [Configure project preferences for a group](../../../administration-and-setup/manage-groups/create-and-manage-groups/configure-project-preferences-group.md).

You have the following options for creating a project from a template:

* Create a project from a template in the Projects area
* Create a project from a template at the template level
* Attach a template to an existing project

  For information, see [Attach a template to a project](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/attach-template-to-project.md).
