# Project maximums {#project-maximums}

Project maximums are in place to improve product performance and enhance your experience with `Workfront`. The following project components have maximums:


## Tasks {#tasks}

The maximum number of tasks per project is 5,000. A warning message displays when the number of tasks approaches this maximum. When the maximum is reached, an error message displays and additional tasks cannot be added to the project.


To avoid reaching this maximum, move tasks that are closed to another project designated for closed tasks. Reports on these projects may need to be adjusted.


## Issues {#issues}

The maximum number of issues per project is 10,000. A warning message displays when the number of issues approaches this maximum. When the maximum is reached, an error message displays and additional issues cannot be added to the project.


To avoid reaching this maximum, move issues that are closed to another project designated for closed issues. Reports on these projects may need to be adjusted.


## Duration {#duration}

The maximum duration of a project is 15 years. A warning message displays when the project duration approaches the maximum. When the maximum is reached, a warning message displays and the automatic timeline calculations cease.


The automatic timeline calculations will resume as soon as a project's duration is reduced below 15 years by adjusting the tasks or issues in the project.


## Timeline Calculations {#timeline-calculations}

Timeline calculations cease for projects that haven't been updated in 6 months and will not resume until an update is made.


For projects that haven't been updated in 3 months, timeline calculations will be done weekly instead of nightly.
