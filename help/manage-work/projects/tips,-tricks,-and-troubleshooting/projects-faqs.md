### Answer {#answer-3}

You cannot change the status of a project to complete if you have any of the following on your project: 



* Incomplete tasks or issues
* Task or issues in pending approval status




## Why can I not change the project status from Complete to Current? {#why-can-i-not-change-the-project-status-from-complete-to-current}



### Answer {#answer-4}

If the project has the Completion Mode set to Automatic,** **once all the tasks and issues are completed, the status of the project automatically turns to Complete and you cannot modify it to any other status.  



To modify the Completion Mode of the project:



1. Go to a project.
1.  Edit the project.
1. In the **Portfolio** section, change the **Completion Mode** from **Automatic** to **Manual**.

1.  Click **Save Changes**.  
   You can now change the status of the project to **Current**.





## Why can I not add a Project to a Portfolio, although I have the correct permissions to do so?  {#why-can-i-not-add-a-project-to-a-portfolio-although-i-have-the-correct-permissions-to-do-so}

Although I have the correct permissions, the Add Projects button is missing on the Projects tab of the Portfolio. 


### Answer {#answer-5}

This is caused by the Portfolio Status being Inactive. To change the status of the Portfolio:



1. Click on **Portfolio Details>Overview**. 
1. Change the **Status** to **Active.  
  
   **

1. Click **Save**.  
   The **Add Projects** button should now be visible on the **Projects** tab. 





## What access does a Resource Manager receive when added to a project? {#what-access-does-a-resource-manager-receive-when-added-to-a-project}



### Answer {#answer-6}

Resource Managers automatically receive Manage access to projects. Keep in mind that this access is not editable until the user is removed from the Resource Manager role. Removing the user from the Resource Manager role does not remove their Manage sharing access.


## Why does the project status change when I add a group? {#why-does-the-project-status-change-when-i-add-a-group}



### Answer {#answer-7}

The project statuses change because of the default statuses of the Group. When you add a group to a project, it changes the list of statuses to the default statuses set for the group.


For more information, see the article [Create and customize system wide statuses](create-customize-statuses.md).
