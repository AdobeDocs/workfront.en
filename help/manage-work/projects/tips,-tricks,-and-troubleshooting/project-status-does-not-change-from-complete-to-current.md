# Project status will not change from Complete to Current {#project-status-will-not-change-from-complete-to-current}



## Problem {#problem}

The project Status does not change from Complete back to Current. 


The cause of this problem is the Completion Mode setting on your project. If a project's Completion Mode is set to Automatic, then the project will automatically change the status from Current to Complete after the project's percent complete bar is 100%.


## Solution {#solution}

If a project's Completion Mode is set to Manual, then the project status can be changed from Current to Complete anytime.


To update a project's completion mode to Manual:



1. Go to the project you want to update.
1.  Edit the project. 
1. Click **Settings**.
1. Locate the **Completion Mode** drop-down menu, and select **Manual**.

1. Click **Save Changes**.
