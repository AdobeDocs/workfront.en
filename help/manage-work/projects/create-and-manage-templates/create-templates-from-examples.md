# Create project templates from examples

As an Adobe Workfront administrator, you can download several preconfigured templates in your Workfront instance using Blueprints. Blueprints provides basic building blocks to help you create a work management system that grows with you. You can browse the blueprints catalog and install ready-to-use project templates. Each template is targeted to a department and specific maturity level to help you implement proven best practices in your system faster. For more information, see Configure a blueprint.
