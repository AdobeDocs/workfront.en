# Project template overview {#project-template-overview}

You can use project templates to capture most of the repeatable processes, information, and settings associated with the projects in your organization.


You can define tasks, queue topics, custom forms, attach documents in your template. 


After creating templates, you can attach them to existing projects, or you can use them to build new projects. All the information on the template transfers to the projects that are created using it. 


The following are some of the benefits of using templates for creating your projects:



* It saves you time and effort when creating new projects that are repetitive.
* You have consistent information across projects that are similar in scope.
* It is helpful when reporting on projects. For example, you can report on projects that share the same template, to compare their progress and find improvements in how they could be completed. 


You can create a new template in the following ways:



* From scratch.  
  For more information about creating a new template from scratch, see [Create a project template](create-template.md).

* From existing projects, by saving a project as a template.  
  For more information about creating templates from existing projects, see [Create template from project](create-template-from-project.md).

* By copying it from another template.  
  For more information about copying an existing template, see [Copy a project template](copy-template.md).

* By using our example templates.
