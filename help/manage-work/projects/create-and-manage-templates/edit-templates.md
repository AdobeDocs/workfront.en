# Edit project templates

You can edit project templates to reflect changes in project processes and settings. After you update and save the changes on a template, the new changes are visible in new projects when the projects are created using the template. The changes you make on the template do not reflect on the project currently using that template.

## Add tasks to a template

After you have created your template and have edited the template information, you can add tasks to it.

Adding tasks to a template is similar to adding tasks to a project.

For more information about adding tasks to a project, see [Create tasks in a project](../../../manage-work/tasks/create-tasks/create-tasks-in-project.md).

When you add tasks to a template, the Duration of the template and the Start and Completion Days of the template change accordingly. For information about the Start and Completion Days of the template and of the template tasks, see [Overview of Start and Completion Days in a template](../../../manage-work/projects/create-and-manage-templates/overview-of-start-completion-day-on-template.md).

## Add additional items to a template

After you have created your template and have edited the template information, you can add more items to it. The items you add will be available for the project when you are creating it from the template.

Adding the following items to a template is identical to adding them to a project:

* Documents
* Risks

  For more information about creating risks, see the

  For information about associating approval processes with work, see [Associate a new or existing approval process with work](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/associate-approval-with-work.md).

* Billing Rates

  For more information about overriding billing rates for a project, see [Overview of overriding Job Role Billing Rates and calculating Revenue on a project](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/override-role-billing-rates-and-calculate-project-revenue.md).

* Expenses

  For more information about adding expenses, see [Manage project expenses](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/manage-project-expenses.md).

* Topic Groups and Queue Topics

  For more information about adding Topic Groups and Queue Topics to a project or template, see [Create a Request Queue](../../../manage-work/requests/create-and-manage-request-queues/create-request-queue.md).

You can add the following items to the tasks in the template:

* Documents
* Expenses

  For more information about adding expenses, see [Manage project expenses](../../../manage-work/projects/project-finances/manage-project-expenses.md).

* Approvals

  For more information about associating approvals with work, see [Associate a new or existing approval process with work](../../../review-and-approve-work/manage-approvals/associate-approval-with-work.md).

## Overview of Start and Completion Days in a template

* [Start Day](#start%20da) 
* [Completion Day](#completi)

### Start Day

Consider the following when working with templates and template tasks:

* By default, templates have a Start Day of 0 and the template tasks and the template show a Start Day of 0. The Start Day of the template tasks can change but this does not change the Start Day of the template.
* The start day of a template task represents the number of business days that *Workfront* adds to the task's Planned Start Date when a project is created from the template. For example, you can have a template with only one task and the Start Day of the template task is 4. The Start Day of the template is still 0. When you create a project from this template where the project's Schedule Mode is Start Date, and the Planned Start Date of the project is November 1, 2019, the newly-created task adds 4 days to this date and sets its Planned Start Date value to November 5, 2019.

The following are some actions that might change the Start Day of the template tasks:

* Update the Duration of predecessor template tasks
* Update the Task Constraints

  When using date-based Task Constraints, you can manually update the Start Day of the template tasks. Some examples of date-based Task Constraints are Fixed Dates, Start No Earlier Than, Start No Later Than, Must Start On. 

* Update the template task predecessors

### Completion Day

The Completion Day of the template is the day when the last template task completes. By default, all template tasks and the template show a Completion Day of 1, because Workfront assumes that any template task has a Duration of 1 Day. The Completion Day of the template tasks can change and this also changes the Completion Day of the template. The Completion Day of the template becomes the Planned Completion Date of the future project and the Completion Days of the template tasks become the Planned Completion Dates of the future project tasks.

The following are some actions that might change the Completion Day of the template tasks:

* Update the Duration of the template tasks
* Update the Task Constraints

  When using date-based Task Constraints, you can manually update the Completion Day of the template tasks. Some examples of date-based Task Constraints are Fixed Dates, Finish No Earlier Than, Finish No Later Than, Must Finish On. 

* Update the template task predecessors
