# Delegate work overview

When you plan to be out of the office for a short period of time, you can temporarily delegate your work to other users to ensure that your absence does not become a roadblock to work being completed.

For example, if certain tasks are due before you return but you do not have the time to complete them before you leave, you can delegate your tasks to another user so they can complete them on time and not delay the completion of the project until after you return.

You can delegate the following objects in *Adobe Workfront*:

* Projects where you are designated as the Project Owner
* Tasks assigned to you
* Issues assigned to you

  -->

* Proof approvals assigned to you
* Project, task, issue, document approvals assigned to you.

This article contains general information about delegating projects, tasks, issues, and proof approvals.
