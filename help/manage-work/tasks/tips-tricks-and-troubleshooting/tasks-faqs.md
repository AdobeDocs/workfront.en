# Tasks FAQs {#tasks-faqs}



## Does the user who assigns tasks to other users receive notifications about changes or updates on the tasks they assign? {#does-the-user-who-assigns-tasks-to-other-users-receive-notifications-about-changes-or-updates-on-the-tasks-they-assign}



### Answer {#answer}

By default, a task requester/ assigner does not receive email notifications for the changes on the tasks that they assign to other users. The amount of notifications on these tasks would be overwhelming for someone who assigns a large number of tasks routinely. 


## Why does the New Task button not show in the Subtasks `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> section</MadCap:conditionalText>`? {#why-does-the-new-task-button-not-show-in-the-subtasks-section}

The New Task button does not show in the subtask `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> section </MadCap:conditionalText>`when there is an Approval on the main task.


### Answer {#answer-1}

The New Task button does not show because *`Adobe Workfront`* does not allow a task with an Approval to become a parent task.
