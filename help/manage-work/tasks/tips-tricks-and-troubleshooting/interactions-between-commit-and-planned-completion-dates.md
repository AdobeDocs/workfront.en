# Interactions between the Commit Date and the Planned Completion Date {#interactions-between-the-commit-date-and-the-planned-completion-date}

The following list explains the interactions between the Commit Date and the Planned Completion Date:



* What is the Commit Date? 
    
    
    * The Commit Date is meant to show when the assignee finishes the work on a task or issue. 
    
    
      For information about Commit Dates, see [Commit Date overview](overview-of-commit-dates.md).
    
    
    
* What is the Planned Completion Date? 
    
    
    * The Planned Completion Date is meant to show when the project manager expects the task or issue to be completed. 
    
    
      For more information about Planned Completion dates, see [Overview of the project Planned Completion Date](project-planned-completion-date.md).  

    
    
    
* How do they interact? 
    
    
    * If the project manager assigns the task or issue a Planned Completion Date, the Commit Date will be the same date. The assignee working on the task or issue can request to change the Planned Completion Date by changing the Commit Date. 
    
    
      >[!TIP] {type="tip"}
      >
      >Only the assignee can update the Commit Date of a task or issue. 
    
    
    
    * If the project manager does not assign a Planned Completion Date, the assignee working on the task can choose the Commit Date which will then set the Planned Completion date. The Planned Completion Date on the issue must be set manually, in this case.
