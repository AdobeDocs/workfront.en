# Update the Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type

By default, `Adobe Workfront` calculates the Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type based on the amount of Planned Hours. However, you can also manually edit the amount of Planned Hours and the Duration of a Simple Duration task in certain areas of `Workfront`.

You can either edit Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type inline or at the task level in the Assignments area.

For more information about editing information inline, see [Inline edit items in a list in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/inline-edit-objects.md).

This article describes how you can update the Planned Hours and Duration for a task with a Simple Duration Type at the task level, in the Assignments area.

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td> 
   <td> <p><span>Work</span> or higher</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level configurations*</td> 
   <td> <p>Edit access to&nbsp;Tasks</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level. For information on how a <span>Workfront administrator</span> can modify your access level, see <a href="../../../administration-and-setup/add-users/configure-and-grant-access/create-modify-access-levels.md" class="MCXref xref">Create or modify custom access levels</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Object permissions</td> 
   <td> <p>Manage permissions to the task</p> <p>For information on requesting additional access, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/grant-and-request-access-to-objects/request-access.md" class="MCXref xref">Request access to objects in Adobe Workfront</a>.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;To find out what plan, license type, or access you have, contact your `Workfront administrator`.

## Update the Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>After you manually update the Duration on a Simple Duration task, `Workfront` stops calculating it based on the Planned Hours.

To edit the Planned Hours and Duration of a task with a Simple Duration Type in the Advanced Assignments box:

1. In a task list, click the name of the task for which you want to change the duration type.
1. Do one of the following:

  * Click the More icon next to the name of the task, click Edit, then Assignments.

1. Enter a total value for the `Planned Hours` for all the assignments, for example, 10 hours. The total number of Planned Hours is distributed equally between all the resources assigned to the task.
1. (Optional) Manually adjust the Planned Hours of each resource assigned to the task.&nbsp;The total number of Planned Hours for the task updates to reflect the new hours individually assigned to your resources.
1. Enter a value for the task `Duration`, for example 2 Days.

1. Click `Save`.
