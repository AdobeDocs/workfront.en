# Manage task information in the Task Details Overview area

You can view or edit the information of a task by accessing the Overview area of the Task&nbsp;Details section. There is a limited number of fields that you can view or edit in this area. For information about editing all information for a task see [Edit tasks](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/edit-tasks.md).

This article describes how to view or edit information in the Overview area of Task Details. For information about updating other areas of Task Details , see the following articles:

* [Manage task finances in the Task Details section](../../../manage-work/tasks/manage-tasks/task-finances-in-details.md) 
* [Add a custom form to an object](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/add-a-custom-form-to-an-object.md) 
* [Manage custom forms attached to objects in Adobe Workfront](../../../workfront-basics/work-with-custom-forms/manage-custom-forms-attached-to-objects.md)

## Access requirements

You must have the following:

Your project manager has enabled the Use Work Effort to automatically calculate task Planned Hours field on the project.
