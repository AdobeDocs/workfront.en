# Make smart assignments {#make-smart-assignments}

You can use smart assignments to identify who the best user is to complete the work. Smart assignments are suggestions for users that *`Adobe Workfront`* presents to you when you assign work items to resources based on an algorithm that determines the most appropriate resource for the job. For information about smart assignments, see [Smart assignments overview](smart-assignments.md). 


## Access requirements {#access-requirements}

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table style="width: 100%;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('../../../Resources/TableStyles/TableStyle-List-options-in-steps.css');" class="TableStyle-TableStyle-List-options-in-steps" cellspacing="0">

    *  A task or issue list or report 
    *  A task or issue header
    *  The task or issue Summary panel
    *  The Assignments field for an item listed in the Home area
