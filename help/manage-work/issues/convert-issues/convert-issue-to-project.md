# Convert an issue to a project in *`Adobe Workfront`* {#convert-an-issue-to-a-project-in-adobe-workfront}

The highlighted information on this page refers to functionality not yet generally available. It is available only in the Preview Sandbox environment.


If more work needs to be done to complete an issue after the issue is submitted, you can convert the issue to a project. 


You can convert an issue to a new project or you can convert it to a project using a template.&nbsp;This article describes both ways for converting issues to projects. 


For general information about converting issues, see [Overview of converting issues in Adobe Workfront](convert-issues.md).

## Convert an issue to a project {#convert-an-issue-to-a-project}


You can convert an issue to a blank project or convert an issue to a project using a template.

Converting an issue to a project differs depending on what environment you use. 



*  [Convert an issue to a project in the Production environment](#convert) 
*  [Convert an issue to a project in the Preview environment](#convert2) 




#### Convert an issue to a project in the Production environment {#convert-an-issue-to-a-project-in-the-production-environment}




1.  `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Go to a project and click  <span class="bold">Issues</span> in the left panel. </MadCap:conditionalText>`  ![](assets/qs-issues-icon-highlighted-on-project.png)



1.  Click the issue to be converted to access the issue.
1.   `<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="QuicksilverOrClassic.Quicksilver"> Click the  <span class="bold">More</span> menu  <img src="assets/more-icon.png"> to the right of the issue name, then hover over  <span class="bold">Convert to Project</span>.</MadCap:conditionalText>` 


   ![](assets/qs-issue-more-menu-highlighted-350x430.png)



   ` `**Tip: **`` If the issue is associated with an approval process or it is already associated with a resolving object, *`Workfront`* displays a warning at the top of the Convert to Project box to notify you that the approval will be removed or the resolving object will be overwritten during the conversion. For more information, see [Overview of converting issues in Adobe Workfront](convert-issues.md).

1.  In the submenu that displays, do one of the following:

    
    
    *  Click `New Project` to covert the issue to a blank project.
    *  Click the name of a template listed in the `New from Template` section to convert the issue to a project using the template.
    
    
   The Convert to Project box displays. 

1.  Update the name of the project in the `Name` field. 


   By default, the name of the issue becomes the name of the project. 

1. (Optional) Update the available project fields in the Convert to Project box.  
   For more information about editing fields on projects, see [Edit projects](edit-projects.md).

1.  (Optional and conditional) Click `Options`, then select from the options that are available:

    
    
    *  ` `Keep the original issue and tie its resolution to the this project`  
      `When deselected, the original issue is deleted.
    
    
      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >Users without access or permissions to delete issues will not be able to delete the issue as they are converting it, regardless of the status of this setting. For information about access and permissions to issues, see:

      >    *  [Share an issue in Adobe Workfront](share-an-issue.md) 
      >    
      >    

    
    
    
    * ` `Allow <User Name> to have access to this project`  
      `If unselected, the issue's Primary Contact has no access to the new task.
    
    


   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >
   >The options that are available here depend on how the *`Workfront administrator`* has configured them for everyone in the system or for your group. For more information, see [Configure system-wide task and issue preferences](set-task-issue-preferences.md).
   >
   >
   >Or, if the top-level groups in your organization configured them separately, the options available here depend on which group you selected for the new project in step 6. For more information, see [Configure task and issue preferences for a group](configure-task-issue-preferences-group.md) `.`




1.  (Optional) In the `Custom Forms` section, do one of the following: 

    
    
    *  If you convert the issue to a blank project, expand the `Add Forms` drop-down menu to attach custom forms  
      For more information about transferring information from the custom form of the issue to that of the new project, see [Transfer custom form data to a larger work item](transfer-custom-form-data-larger-item.md).
    *  If you convert the issue to a project using a template, do any of the following:
    
        
        
        *  Review the custom forms attached to the template.&nbsp;They will transfer to the new project.
        *  Update information on the custom forms, and ensure that all required fields have valid values. 
        *  Rearrange the custom forms by clicking `Manage Forms`, then the `grab` handle ![](assets/drag-object-icon.png), and drag and drop them in the correct place. Click `I'm done managing` when you finish rearranging the forms. 
        *  Click the `x icon` to the right of any form that you do not want to transfer to the project to remove it. 
        *  Expand the `Add Custom Forms` menu to add more forms to the project. 
        
        
    
    *  (Optional and conditional) If you want to transfer custom form information from the issue you are converting to the project, add the project custom form that contains the same fields whose information you want to transfer from the issue. For information, see [Transfer custom form data to a larger work item](transfer-custom-form-data-larger-item.md). 
    
    

1.  Click `Save Changes.`


   ![](assets/qs-issue-convert-to-project-before-saving-ui-350x206.png)




   The issue is now a project, if you decided to delete the original issue.  
   Or  
   The issue is now linked to the new project and it will complete when the project completes, if you decided to keep the original issue. 


   Some issue fields transfer to the project. Most fields defined in the template automatically transfer to the newly created project if you didn't change them in previous steps. For information, see [Overview of converting issues in Adobe Workfront](convert-issues.md)

1.  (Optional) Set any further project details â€‹(project owner, project dates) and tasks as necessary.
