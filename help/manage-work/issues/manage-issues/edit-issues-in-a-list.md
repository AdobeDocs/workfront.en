## Inline edit issues

You can edit issue information in a list of issues, by inline editing fields displayed in the view of the list.

Consider the following when editing issues in a list:

* You can edit any issue field that displays in the list and that you have permissions to update.
* You can edit an issue in the following lists:

  * The Issues section of a project or of a task 
  * An issue report

To inline edit an issue:

<ol> 
 <li value="1">Go to a list of issues in a project or task. </li> 
 <li value="2"> <p>Click inside any field that you have permissions to update manually. The field becomes editable and you can make your changes.</p> <p> <img src="assets/edit-issues-inline-350x34.png" style="width: 350;height: 34;"> </img> </p> </li> 
 <li value="3"> <p>Press enter when you want to accept your changes. Changes are saved immediately. </p> <p>For information about inline editing objects, see <a href="../../../workfront-basics/navigate-workfront/use-lists/inline-edit-objects.md" class="MCXref xref">Inline edit items in a list in&nbsp;Adobe Workfront</a>. </p> </li>
