## Considerations about moving issues

Consider the following when moving&nbsp;issues that contain documents or are associated with a request queue:

* `When an issue is associated with a requests queue:` When you move&nbsp;an issue to another object&nbsp;and the issue&nbsp;is associated with a request queue, the moved&nbsp;issue is no longer associated with the original queue&nbsp;the first issue originated from.
* `When a document is attached to the issue:`&nbsp;When you move&nbsp;an issue to another object&nbsp;and the issue has a document attached to it, the document, its versions and proofs also move to the new&nbsp;issue. Any approvals associated with the document do&nbsp;not move.
* `When an issue is linked to a document or a folder:`&nbsp;When you move&nbsp;an issue which has documents or folders linked to a a third party service like Google Drive, the&nbsp;links to the documents move with the issue.&nbsp;
