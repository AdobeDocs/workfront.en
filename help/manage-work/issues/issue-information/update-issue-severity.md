#  Update issue severity

You can associate a severity with issues in `Adobe Workfront`. Tasks and projects do not have severities.

Issues are unexpected events that can prevent your projects from finishing on time or within budget.&nbsp;You can use severities to indicate how serious an issue is.&nbsp;

Your `Workfront administrator` defines the severities available in `Workfront`. After they establish them, they are available for you to associate with an issue.  
For more information about creating severities in `Workfront`, see [Create and customize issue severities](../../../administration-and-setup/customize-workfront/creating-custom-status-and-priority-labels/create-customize-issue-severities.md).

You must have Contribute permissions on an issue to be able to update its severity.&nbsp;

You can update the severity of issues in the following areas of `Workfront`:

* In the  `Edit Issue` dialog box
* In the Issue Details area of an issue 
* In an issue list or report

## Access requirements

You must have the following access to perform the steps in this article:

<table cellspacing="0">

 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> plan*</td> 
   <td> <p>Any </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader"><span>Adobe Workfront</span> license*</td>

   <td> <p>Edit access to Issues</p> <p>Note: If you still don't have access, ask your <span>Workfront administrator</span> if they set additional restrictions in your access level.
